            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is crucial in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share specific traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically impact their current negotiation and influence discussions. People naturally interpret other cultures through the lens of their own experiences.\n\nTo effectively engage with different cultures, one must invest time in understanding their historical context and inherent biases. Success in negotiations requires accepting cultural differences rather than trying to modify them, particularly when operating from a position of lesser influence. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs helps overcome cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Each company develops its unique corporate culture, visible in various aspects such as work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and charitable activities. Even within the same country, corporate cultures can vary significantly between companies and across different locations. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous than others, deeper examination often reveals subtle but important distinctions.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is essential as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment of their organization or leaders to achieve success. Similarly, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may be less inclined to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, getting to know one's counterpart personally can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The biblical quote \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. When comparing their arguments, we must assume they're both discussing the same biblical God, as considering alternative divine concepts would complicate the comparison. However, while both philosophers present compelling points, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding God through internal reflection and understanding. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our minds, God must exist, as we cannot truly imagine His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its presentation, his core message is that proof of God resides within human consciousness, requiring no external evidence. This internal validation aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly useful for Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through logic rather than requiring belief in unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence, focusing on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His method resembles completing a puzzle: even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning about the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or perspectives from their readers regarding key themes. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully demonstrates several of these methods. His techniques include unconventional pairing of adjectives with nouns and the strategic use of color symbolism, particularly with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Specifically, Fitzgerald develops deep symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink throughout the novel, using these associations to trigger particular emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire: Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene.\n\nFitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: the \"white chasms\" of downtown New York, the \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment building described as part of a \"white cake of apartment-houses.\" The author also uses these colors to characterize ordinary people and places: Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and various minor characters described as \"gray.\"\n\nOnce this color symbolism is established, Fitzgerald employs it to subtly communicate character qualities, particularly with Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Daisy's portrayal in white clothing and a white car suggests her role as a uniform, almost generic object of Gatsby's desire rather than a fully developed character. This impression is reinforced through continued references to white and gray in her descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white dress\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts exceptional agricultural productivity due to its favorable climate conditions. The region produces a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, vegetables, and various fruits, along with honey and peppers. The local demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is so high that many organizations maintain substantial waiting lists. Local organic farms often combine agricultural operations with recreational opportunities, offering tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nOrganic farming presents both advantages and challenges. While it promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it typically involves higher operational costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming methods. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase management complexity and expenses, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable resources for landowners seeking to balance profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion's conservation plan. This area supports numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property has a rich historical background, starting with centuries of Native American presence, followed by late 1800s settlement by ranchers and wood sellers. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many years. The case study examined this real estate opportunity and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small-scale farmers interested in combining sustainable agriculture with wildlife conservation.",
            "The relationship between brothers is characterized by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their bond's true nature emerges, whether positive or negative. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, and understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers see their reflection in each other's eyes, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than others' perceptions of them.\n\nThis concept is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate their complex relationship against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where fierce pride collides with crushing disappointment, resulting in tragedy. The story conveys its message through the explicit portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the intricate emotions and worldview that drive the protagonist's behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their first shared moments to their final tragic encounter. He had dreamed of a brother who could match him in physical activities like breath-holding, running, climbing, and racing to Horsehead Landing. These aspirations were impossible due to Doodle's severe heart condition, which threatened his survival from birth and prevented any strenuous activity. This reality devastated the protagonist, whose youthful dreams were suddenly shattered. His frustration manifested in dark thoughts, even contemplating infanticide, though these thoughts dissipated when Doodle smiled at him, revealing an underlying, instinctive brotherly love beneath his conflicted emotions.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated system for processing information and generating creative outputs. Throughout history, people have tried to understand it through different comparisons - from ancient analogies like wax tablets and papyrus to modern parallels with computers. However, it's important to recognize that these comparisons have limitations and shouldn't be taken too literally.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo two types of processing: bottom-up, which builds understanding from basic sensory details (like identifying shapes and colors), and top-down, which uses existing knowledge to enhance perception (such as distinguishing between a solid object and a hole of the same shape).\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system that determines which information deserves focus. This system can both suppress unnecessary details (like individual grass blades in your visual field) and highlight important information (such as hearing your name in a crowded room). This filtering process occurs repeatedly throughout information processing.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different methods for various types of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be stored based on visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nScientists have proposed various models to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model, the semantic network theory, suggests that information is stored as interconnected concepts, similar to a web where related ideas (like \"chair\" and \"table\") are linked together.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis devastated the United States economy, triggering widespread unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting crucial questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves sparked a chain reaction that contaminated these repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999, during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and shareholders, was expanding mortgage access to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that an economic downturn could necessitate government intervention, similar to the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. These financial instruments created deep interconnections between the housing market and various economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported combined mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, equivalent to 30% of GDP. This resulted in the cut-rate sales of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were ultimately placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Exposition can be a tricky element in writing. While it might seem like an opportunity to showcase your literary prowess, it often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin find themselves irritated when encountering excessive information dumps in texts.\n\nHere's the harsh truth: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nThough writers are familiar with the golden rule of \"Show, don't tell,\" many still fall into the trap of writing lengthy, static passages. Exposition acts like a tempting voice, suggesting either to rush through background information or, conversely, to detail every minute aspect of characters' histories.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is straightforward narration of events. In movies, it manifests as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written works, it's direct narration from the author.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that a heroine met her future husband, had a grand wedding, and witnessed his murder - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers. Instead, the story should develop the husband's character through his actions and words, demonstrating his love for his wife. Similarly, the heroine's transformation through their relationship should be depicted through meaningful interactions and moments. This deeper characterization allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand both characters, making the husband's death more impactful.\n\nThe basic plot points \"They met, they married, he died\" need fuller development.\n\nAs an author, you must resist the urge to rapidly list character details. For instance, when introducing a new character, don't simply state their military background, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences in one quick burst. Such information dumps diminish the story's impact and reader engagement.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nThe next segment detailed a Med-Flight helicopter incident involving a .22 caliber rifle shot, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. This was followed by a brief weather report predicting weekend rain and temperatures in the mid-80s, seemingly designed to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story discussed Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez's conviction for marijuana distribution to Ohio, curiously expressing his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighting his ethnicity.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed concerning patterns in how race and ethnicity were handled in news reporting, with apparent disparities in coverage depth and emphasis depending on the subjects' backgrounds.",
            "Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that combine the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. They follow various assets, indices, or commodities while offering advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these benefits, ETFs maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, investors should note that ETF trades incur commissions similar to stock transactions. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully assess claimed advantages like diversification and their actual extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it against its top 10 holdings to evaluate whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. The study also aims to determine if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, the analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, their asset percentages were normalized to 100%, allowing for calculations of portfolio Beta and Return contributions. The results show that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo verify the statistical significance of these differences, the analysis includes an examination of standard deviations for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 shows a significant decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Several factors may explain this decrease. The winter season at a New England campus naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. Furthermore, the holiday season and subsequent academic break mean many people are absent from campus, extending into late January when spring classes begin. However, these factors don't fully explain February's low participation rates.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects naturally wanes over time. To counter this decline, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation. This highlights two key challenges: maintaining long-term engagement and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers convenience and autonomy. To encourage participation, we distributed various incentives, including gift certificates for local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project might have better sustained interest. For example, introducing larger rewards like bicycles or even hybrid/electric vehicles could have prevented the participation decline. While our initial gift card incentives proved adequate, escalating the prize value over time—such as announcing bicycle giveaways in December and a vehicle prize in January—might have maintained or even increased engagement levels instead of seeing them drop.",
            "While examining early Edison films in the Library of Congress collection, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create visual deceptions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common artistic elements in most trick films while noting the unusual characteristics that emerged in some later productions. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently featured indoor sets filmed from a fixed, front-facing perspective similar to viewing a theatrical stage. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This approach, derived from theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame without the camera following their exits.\n\nThe theatrical staging approach naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage simultaneously. The performers typically remained at a consistent distance from the camera, eliminating any opportunity for close-range shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, though this was often an illusion created through clever editing. These films typically ran for about a minute or less and focused on simple magical effects like disappearances or transformations rather than complex narratives. For instance, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears to be one continuous shot but actually contains hidden edits to achieve its special effects, particularly in the beheading sequence.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has experienced varied reception, from criticism of its superficiality to praise for its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical and contemporary romantic elements to establish a new literary genre. Walpole incorporated traditional theatrical devices with modern naturalistic storytelling to create what he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across different contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. The genre's longevity stems from its unique combination of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and fresh for readers across generations.\n\nThe concept of Chivalry stands as a fundamental Gothic element, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined the ideal knight's training and behavior, is both preserved and transformed in Walpole's work. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived moral decline in their contemporary society. Through chivalric themes, the medieval past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, likely viewed the Gothic era's supposed moral superiority as a stark contrast to his contemporary society's degradation. This perspective is exemplified through characters like Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, though often presented with Gothic literature's characteristic tendency toward excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, supply, manufacturing, and distribution to final delivery. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the entire supply chain process. During this stage, managers determine the what, when, where, and how of production by analyzing market trends to understand customer demands. Once they've assessed market needs, they make decisions about product types, quantities, and manufacturing locations, considering factors like plant capacity and quality capabilities. They then focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in production planning is crucial, as mistakes can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target implement detailed protocols for everything from employee dress codes to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations.\n\nSupply, the second key component, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes or consider outsourcing to external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while minimizing or controlling costs.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with aristocratic life. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from these typical Victorian conventions. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that were uncommon for their time, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nIn chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences the event through a dreamlike state while seeking assistance. The passage demonstrates Oliver's powerlessness during these events and his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes dulled, failing to notice who helps him, while experiencing constant pain mixed with fear rather than initial shock. This scene raises questions about the forces controlling Oliver's fate, as he appears incapable of influencing outcomes even when his life is at stake.\n\nThe passage suggests Oliver's growing sense of helplessness and possible submission to Fagin's influence, as shown by his inability to fight back or take action to save himself. This lack of resistance implies that Fagin may have succeeded in breaking Oliver's spirit, leading him to accept his desperate circumstances rather than actively resist them. The text's description of time's distortion - the swift passing of day and the paradoxically long yet brief night - further emphasizes the psychological impact of these events on Oliver.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While helping a third or fourth-grade Latino student named Adrian with his reading difficulties, I noticed unusual patterns in his letter pronunciation. Despite his perfect English speaking abilities, something seemed off. The breakthrough came when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - I realized Adrian's reading struggles stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than reading comprehension itself.\n\nThis experience illustrates the complex language barriers present in our educational system, particularly in California. It shows how language challenges aren't always obvious, even when students speak English fluently. The solution isn't one-dimensional - while Adrian needed focused help with English alphabet and pronunciation, other students with limited English proficiency require more comprehensive support. Success lies in combining various approaches: dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, offers significant benefits for all students, not just non-native English speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs typically perform better academically than their peers. While some worry about resource allocation and necessity, implementing these programs as standard practice would benefit the entire student population. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual - which would be impractical - we could employ bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this system.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions like Sunday school or Temple, or through personal introspection, we seek spiritual meaning. While many accept their inherited religious beliefs, others completely reject the notion of a higher power, embracing only their own limited perspective. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek enlightenment.\n\nOne rainy evening, I shared a moment with my father on our porch, smoking cigarettes beneath the loud tin roof. When I asked about his favorite bird, he simply replied, \"A cardinal.\" He seemed distant, gazing into the rain with a contemplative look. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose on his thinning frame, and his hair had noticeably thinned. I wanted to express how much I'd miss him, but speaking those words would make his impending death too real. Instead, I moved closer, and we sat together watching the rain in companionable silence.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The cancer treatments extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations, but only prolonged his suffering. This experience shattered my faith - I couldn't understand why a benevolent God would allow such suffering. In my solitude, I abandoned prayer, believing God had long since turned away from me.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. As someone who knew him best, I understood he wouldn't want me to watch him die. Instead, I retreated to my bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. The most painful part was that no one even bothered to inform me when it happened.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background significantly influencing his views on personal liberty and governance. His farming roots shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial processes.\n\nTaylor saw unique potential in America's ability to establish an ideal governmental system, unburdened by established traditions. He championed natural rights as interconnected elements that must remain beyond governmental control, arguing that the compromise of one right would inevitably weaken all others. He rejected the notion that society should be dominated by physical strength and cunning, as in the \"state of nature.\"\n\nTaylor advocated for a governmental structure that acknowledged humanity's dual nature of good and evil. He maintained that governmental actions reflected human virtues and vices, promoting principles that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. While he recognized self-interest as a universal human motivator, he believed it became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He emphasized the need for careful governmental oversight to contain humanity's negative tendencies.\n\nAs a Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and limited federal authority. He warned against an expansive federal government, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its high costs. However, he cautioned against purely literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached precision. My mind processed the visual information mechanically, avoiding any deeper interpretation. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, leaving no lasting impression - just pure observation of the moment.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation. Having wanted to learn drawing since childhood, I was drawn to its comprehensive approach. The book taught a technique of using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning overwhelming views into manageable compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply that framing technique. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - this scene before me could only be called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI gripped my tool, my hand moving through the air with purpose, in what might have been a profound artistic moment. The water moved smoothly, crystal-clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. Growing more frustrated, I hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, mop in hand, green tie choking my neck, contemplating this unwelcome \"gift\" left by someone for the bathroom cleaning staff. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand extensively until it resembled protective wear. Standing straight before bending forward, I lowered my hand toward the bowl, reminiscent of retrieving a holiday roast from an oven...",
            "Young drivers face significant risks on the road, with multiple factors contributing to their high accident rates. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving, while their lack of experience compounds the danger. This inexperience leads to higher instances of accidents, particularly involving speeding, rollovers, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors, as demonstrated by research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a direct link between passenger age and accident frequency. While some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers, these measures may not be sufficient.\n\nThe fundamental issue remains that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically ill-equipped to manage driving responsibilities. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, suggests that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This concern becomes more pressing as we anticipate a surge in teenage drivers from the Baby-Boomer generation's children.\n\nA potential solution would involve standardized national legislation raising the minimum driving age to 18. Under this framework, driver's education would continue in schools, but actual vehicle operation would be restricted until adulthood. The system would maintain provisional licensing and required training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's mandate of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. This nationwide approach would address the universal nature of teen driving risks and potentially reduce accident rates across all states.\n\nThis proposed legislative change, while not revolutionary, could significantly impact youth driving safety.",
            "This research paper examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three main aspects. Initially, it provides a clear definition of the condition. The paper then discusses diagnostic methods and identifying characteristics. Lastly, it explores strategies for educators to support CAPD students in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), it involves the central nervous system's ability to process and utilize sound effectively. Importantly, individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability but struggle with processing auditory information, such as distinguishing speech from background noise or separating distinct sounds.\n\nThe condition's history dates back to the 1950s, when it was initially termed \"auditory imperception.\" Notable developments include the work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961. A significant milestone was reached in 1977 with a national conference that spurred further research into childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties in: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, and interpreting auditory information meaningfully. Additionally, some individuals experience auditory masking, where one sound interferes with the processing of another.\n\nDiagnosis involves comprehensive screening procedures conducted by various professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. The diagnostic process typically combines behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, there is no single definitive diagnostic tool, and the condition's exact cause remains unknown. Advanced diagnostic methods include sophisticated acoustic testing and response measurement, often involving tasks requiring patients to process multiple simultaneous audio inputs.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on protecting abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. I bring essential values to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful conduct, ethical behavior, and a commitment to both fostering better interpersonal relationships and maintaining professional competence. These principles aren't merely professional requirements—they're deeply personal convictions.\n\nWhile I've always been drawn to helping others, my career path wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed many peers struggling with personal issues, often through unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment came that summer when I encountered a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After learning he had contacted law enforcement, I visited his parents' home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the officers' request, noting their defensive behavior and tendency to minimize serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice stands as another cornerstone of my commitment to social work. While society claims to value individuality and uniqueness, there's often pressure to conform to established norms. I've consistently challenged social injustice through personal expression and activism, whether through unconventional appearance choices, GSBA advocacy, or speaking out against discrimination and racism. My dedication to social justice isn't just professional—it's a fundamental part of who I am and will continue to be a driving force in my career.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. The paper analyzes relevant research studies to illuminate these models and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to mental disorders, and those linked to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass both Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or II disorders. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disturbances. Dyssomnias include various conditions such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia presents as excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep attacks and REM sleep abnormalities. Unlike Dyssomnias, which affect sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, including conditions like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders, particularly focusing on hypothalamic orexin neurons that regulate sleep-wake cycles. Research with mice has revealed that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety and facilitates sleep onset. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and indicate both genetic and environmental influences on sleep regulation through GABAB receptors. Any dysfunction in these receptors could necessitate medical intervention for proper sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited sleep regulation problems could significantly impact an individual's academic performance, career success, and ability to handle routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "As a student who has spent two and a half years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus mobility. During my freshman year in East Halls, specifically Stuart Hall, I faced lengthy walks of up to 25 minutes to reach central campus locations like the Willard building, especially during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation; where there once were vast empty spaces around East Halls, there are now sports facilities, new buildings including the Creamery and health services, and residential developments. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe bicycle emerges as the ideal solution for campus mobility. However, its effectiveness depends on both student adoption and appropriate infrastructure. This was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who recently returned to cycling, acknowledging it as the most practical transportation method despite its temporary decline in popularity. Cycling isn't just healthy; it's incredibly efficient – a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. It transforms what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking is an alternative, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bike, I'd spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling the most practical choice for my busy academic schedule.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed ideology. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic developments.\n\nThe novel illustrates Marxist false consciousness, where citizens are deliberately kept ignorant of true class relationships, focusing instead on personal pleasure. This is achieved through systematic conditioning, particularly evident in how lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.) are programmed to consume and indulge without questioning their reality. The World Controller's hegemonic control ensures complete dominance over these social classes, who unwittingly embrace and perpetuate the capitalist-consumerist system. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) might have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful interpersonal connections, with characters notably lacking psychological depth. This suggests Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of authentic expression and free will. Relationships remain superficial, with men objectifying women's physical attributes and women casually discussing their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their predetermined position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, demonstrating how the proletariat is manipulated into compliance through false promises of superiority, provided they maintain their consumption patterns and conformity to social norms.",
            "Reflecting on a college course in Islam I took nearly four years ago, I'm struck by how the central debate about Islam's nature as potentially hostile remains even more pertinent today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 antagonism to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic possibility of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting paradox. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portray him as someone who expanded Islam through conquest and forced conversion, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose truth naturally drew followers. This contradiction is particularly striking.\n\nThe biography contains remarkable parallels to Jesus's ministry, such as Muhammad's reported multiplication of food miracle. This apparent attempt to mirror Christian narratives seems designed to establish Muhammad as a humble prophet, though it could be interpreted as diminishing Jesus's unique divine nature by creating similar miraculous accounts.\n\nThe text frequently employs chain-narrative techniques, relating conversions through multiple layers of testimony. While intended to authenticate these accounts, this approach actually makes them less credible due to their reliance on hearsay and distant sources.\n\nPerhaps most troubling is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and gentle leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about modern Muslims' awareness of their faith's historical foundations.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with subsequent theological developments increasingly departing from its initial form. Looking at the broader picture, we observe modern society becoming more progressive and questioning traditional beliefs. While conservatives who resist change still exist, their influence may be waning. Future Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in historical accuracy, seeking to separate later doctrinal additions from Jesus's original message. Though this process may span generations, an inevitable reversal will occur: Christianity will gradually strip away accumulated doctrinal layers, moving backward through time until reaching Jesus's pure, original teachings about God's message to humanity.\n\nThis transformation, particularly in Western societies, will lead to a form of worship more closely aligned with Jesus's time. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current denominational diversity will give way to increasing uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of major historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leaders. This religious reversion will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nTo understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. By 63 BCE, when Rome took control of Jerusalem, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures. The Jewish community was diverse, split between Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "The Jungle illustrates humanity's inherent selfishness and greed, particularly through its portrayal of people's tendency to prioritize their own interests while disregarding those beneath them. This theme is most prominently displayed through the factory owners and managers' behavior. These industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. Sinclair emphasizes this through vivid imagery of industrial pollution, depicting \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrial growth.\n\nThe novel exposes the complete disregard for both environmental and human welfare. Factory owners showed no concern for the pollution their facilities produced or the unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens. More disturbingly, they demonstrated absolute indifference toward their workers' wellbeing. As described in the text, the entire system operated as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumped human dignity. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no legal protections or safety regulations to shield them.\n\nThe absence of worker protection agencies or legitimate labor advocacy organizations left employees completely vulnerable to exploitation. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected workers. The situation in Packingtown was so dire that workers' conditions were comparable to slavery, with the text noting that the predominantly immigrant workforce lived perpetually on the brink of starvation, subject to the whims of employers who were \"every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" This system made moral degradation and suffering inevitable, much like under chattel slavery.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem employs the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings, where it referred to a mythical northern island beyond Britain that Greeks considered the world's edge. However, while Virgil's influence is undeniable, Poe's German literary interests suggest another significant inspiration.\n\nThe connection to German literature is particularly evident through Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted striking similarities between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in 1808 and 1832), included \"The King of Thulé\" in Faust's second part. This poem tells the tale of a grieving king who, after his wife's death, keeps her final gift - a goblet - before ultimately throwing it into the ocean and dying.\n\nThe thematic parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly reflecting Poe's personal struggles with loss and alcohol. Poe used the term \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share similar emotional landscapes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories.\n\nPoe's awareness of Goethe's work was likely reinforced through multiple channels, including his admiration for Tennyson and exposure to various contemporary adaptations of Goethe's works, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 romantic drama version of Faust. The similarities suggest that \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as Poe's response to or reimagining of Goethe's themes.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall incident where a store manager deliberately ignored a hazardous spill. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on spilled applesauce at D&D Markets, after the manager, Paul Martin, ignored two employee notifications about the spill while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded when a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety.\n\nThe facts supporting Palmer's case include:\n- Two separate employee warnings about the spill\n- Manager's 30-minute delay in addressing the hazard\n- Five previous slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009\n- Manager's dismissive response about \"customer complaints\"\n\nThe store's history of similar incidents and the manager's conscious decision to ignore the hazard despite prior accidents strengthen Palmer's argument for punitive damages. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" may be challenging, the manager's deliberate inaction despite knowing the risks (evidenced by previous incidents) demonstrates a conscious disregard for customer safety, potentially meeting California's legal standard for punitive damages as established in Taylor v. Superior Court.",
            "Since the age of 14, she had experienced an inexplicable longing that persisted into her 17th year. Eventually, she realized it wasn't something but someone she yearned for. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none captured her interest. This peculiarity led to frequent self-reflection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations for her unusual emotional state.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with remarkably harmonious parents who rarely conflicted with their daughter, except when it came to her assertions of independence. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her genuine kindness, made her naturally charismatic.\n\nHowever, this particular day deviated from the usual calm when her mother's scream pierced through the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate transportation to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and carefully placed her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical antiseptic atmosphere and underlying tension, she remained solely focused on her mother's wellbeing. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, as it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased instances of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related mortality. The aMed diet, an adapted form of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that Mediterranean diet adherence is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. An experimental study also demonstrated its superiority over low-fat diets in weight management and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people, though stroke risks weren't specifically examined.\n\nThe study monitored 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63, all without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes, from a larger cohort of 121,700 nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The retention rate exceeded 95% throughout the 20-year study. CHD and stroke cases were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when documentation was incomplete.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for various confounding factors including age, smoking, BMI, hormonal factors, supplement use, physical activity, and other lifestyle variables.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling to analyze the data, the study found that higher Mediterranean diet adherence significantly reduced CHD and stroke risk in women. Over the 20-year period, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A photograph captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign declaring \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a street corner. This reference points to Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation under military dictatorship since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. As public participation grew, the initially tolerant government response turned violent, with military forces attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. While official records cite 13 deaths, army defector Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression is deeply rooted in history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese imperial divine status traditions, to modern political-religious alliances, authority figures have long sought absolute control. Notable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Similarly devastating examples include the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militias targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, and the Holocaust under Nazi Germany's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jewish people and other persecuted groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz stems primarily from his long career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work may be understated in many pieces, his genius lay in creating sophisticated compositions that maximized his musicians' individual talents. He developed frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisation opportunities, carefully considering each band member's unique style. This approach allowed him to craft distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of vocals \"as a jazz instrument,\" with Creole Love Call being a notable example. This piece demonstrates his skill in incorporating wordless vocals for textural effect and his ability to showcase his soloists' strengths. The twelve-bar blues composition consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. Vocals and reeds alternate in call-and-response, with vocal tones shifting from smooth to rough\n2. A muted trumpet solo elaborates the melody with extended blue notes\n3. A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by subtle syncopated piano\n4. Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's pattern between brass and reed sections\n5. The piece peaks as reeds lead the call-and-response in high register, supported by brass and rhythm sections in syncopated stop time\n6. Returns to the original format, but with vocals adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag featuring vocals and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative use of vocals as a tonal element became characteristic of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines tight orchestration with tonal experimentation, featuring \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet in dialogue with Baby Cox's scat singing, creating a seamless blend of instrumental and vocal sounds. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with distinctive flair.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might guide these evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that mathematical descriptions of biological forms were in their infancy, this observation remains relevant today. Recent advances have allowed mathematical modeling to be applied to mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (as demonstrated by Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research combines mathematical modeling and experimental work to understand how Prunum shells develop and evolve. We analyzed X-ray images of various Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling potential shell forms, we can better understand the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental data to comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space in 360-degree cycles. These rotations create whorls that spiral around a central axis called the columella. The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a line called a suture. The final and typically largest whorl is called the body whorl, while all preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base (bottom), with the animal accessing the outside through the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (facing the opening), and abapertural (opposite the opening). The standard viewing position is apertural, with the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, one should examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line. Whorls are then counted from this line in quarter-whorl increments.\n\nThe shell's growth can be understood as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked by measuring the center points of each whorl's aperture and its dimensions. This information can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing researchers to manipulate parameters and study various aspects of shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality has stagnated over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals in areas like water and sanitation, the country falls significantly behind in meeting its child and maternal health targets for 2015. This shortfall requires a comprehensive health system reform rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased its rate of professionally attended births to 72%, this figure is somewhat deceptive as it includes traditional midwives who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like hemorrhage. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nRegarding improvement strategies, Indonesia faces a choice between targeted programmatic approaches and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer clear objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other healthcare areas (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impacts on family planning) and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved to encompass such a vast array of genres that creating a complete list has become challenging. The complexity increases as major genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal genre has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly difficult. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend modern metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It's often described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, volume, violence, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands sophisticated musicianship, with band members typically displaying advanced instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, resulting in experimental, otherworldly compositions. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This is exemplified in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, which was created as a response to compete with the Rolling Stones' heavier sound and appeared on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, depicts both a woman's wonderment in her dream state and symbolizes Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional artistic styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand this work's significance, context is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful tinsmith. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training and worked as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy struck when his first wife Clémence died, following the loss of eight of their children, leaving him with only his daughter Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. As a self-taught folk artist, his perspective differed from his peers who often idealized peasant life in their works.\n\nRousseau's desperate desire for acceptance in the art world becomes clearer considering his circumstances: he began his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, during an era of established artistic giants. His recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rising fame, though their artistic motivations contrasted sharply. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventionality to gain acceptance from the artistic establishment.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted the strong relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty, between what is true and what is beautiful. This connection appears to exist at a fundamental level, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come naturally. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, as we typically analyze why something is considered beautiful or moral rather than establishing rigid rules for creating art or determining ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, neither artistic nor moral criticism can completely explain what makes something truly good or beautiful. When discussing great artwork like the Mona Lisa, we might analyze technical elements and context, but these alone don't fully explain its greatness. People often preface their appreciation with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This transcendent aspect exists in both art and morality, as noted by writers like Flannery O'Connor, who suggests that some truths can only be conveyed through storytelling rather than direct statements.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that defies complete rational explanation - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral dimensions. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive quality lies in its moral nature, making it particularly relevant to human life and values, as living itself inherently involves moral choices.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural tapestry emerged from diverse tribal and historical origins.\n\nThe historical homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins remain contentious among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungri tribe, formerly called Germans, who had crossed the Rhine to fight the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars accounts, borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, derive from \"ger\" (spear), or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups due to their land's inhospitable nature. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh environment over more hospitable regions unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans maintained a complex relationship with Germania, primarily focusing on trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity become permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception presents a challenging dilemma: choosing between maintaining one's authentic self or preserving relationships with those who may feel betrayed by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions about motivation and necessity. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a social cost, isolating her from female companionship while creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and challenge social conventions. The reactions of both Olivia and Orsino to Viola/Cesario suggest underlying complexities in their understanding of attraction and identity. However, Olivia's quick transition from loving Cesario to accepting Sebastian suggests that Shakespeare may be satirizing superficial attraction rather than exploring deeper questions of sexual identity. This interpretation is reinforced by the play's resolution, where Olivia readily accepts Viola as a sister rather than a former love interest, demonstrating the fluid nature of relationships once truth replaces deception.",
            "The German colonial empire exhibited varying degrees of administrative approaches, despite being commonly associated with brutality, particularly regarding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. Educational policies across German colonies showed significant disparities. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German territories.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (now Namibia) demonstrated markedly different circumstances. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational initiatives, South West Africa relegated native education primarily to missionary organizations with minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This educational disparity resulted in a largely uneducated and illiterate indigenous population, contrasting sharply with other German colonies' achievements.\n\nThe academic literature on German colonial education is extensive, predominantly comprising German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused on describing colonial educational systems, while later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research particularly stands out for its comparative analysis of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many educational differences to South West Africa's larger settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its largely desert terrain, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's educational policies and social structure.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico exemplifies a prolonged international rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), this 57-year period was marked most notably by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the US defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. The antagonism between these nations was rooted in fundamental differences in religion, culture, and material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974).\n\nThis pattern of rivalry is common among neighboring countries, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests. Pletcher (1977) highlights that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have experienced sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) observes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide stemmed from inherited antagonisms between English Protestants and Spanish Catholics, significantly hampering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes, primarily concerning territorial issues and border security. Both nations struggled with cross-border raids and frontier violence until they established stronger military presence along their boundaries (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry eventually diminished in the late 19th century when, according to Schmitt (1974), Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico.",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse – a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science and journalism – I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's kept me going isn't personal strength alone, but the crucial support of family and friends. This experience taught me that even the strongest among us need help when facing life's major challenges.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some obstacles are simply too massive to tackle alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support – which is already strained – I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual assistance rather than retreating into isolated self-reliance.\n\nThe popular conservative notion of \"rugged individualism\" as America's foundation is somewhat misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. Consider the pioneer wagon trains – their success depended on collaboration, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for preparedness – I maintain emergency supplies, including first-aid kits, water purification tools, and non-perishable food. I encourage others to prepare similarly if they have the means. However, equally important is building connections with your community. Knowing and supporting your neighbors is as crucial as any emergency kit.",
            "Around 500-600 BCE, the individual who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings established Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. As this faith approaches its 2,500th anniversary, it has evolved considerably from its original form. This evolution is evident in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, though religiously significant to both monks and lay practitioners, was never part of Buddha's original teachings. These changes extend beyond mere rituals to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community (Buddhasasana), regardless of whether they come from monks or laypeople. External forces stem from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral, though their actions may inadvertently help or harm the Buddhist community.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on seeking refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka (three baskets) of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is crucial for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The faith prescribes five basic precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow additional rules. The foundation of Buddhist teaching lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering (Dukkha), its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is crucial in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share specific traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically impact their current negotiation and influence discussions. People naturally interpret other cultures through the lens of their own experiences.\n\nTo effectively engage with different cultures, one must invest time in understanding their historical context and inherent biases. Success in negotiations requires accepting cultural differences rather than trying to modify them, particularly when operating from a position of lesser influence. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs helps overcome cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Each company develops its unique corporate culture, visible in various aspects such as work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and charitable activities. Even within the same country, corporate cultures can vary significantly between companies and across different locations. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous than others, deeper examination often reveals subtle but important distinctions.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is essential as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment of their organization or leaders to achieve success. Similarly, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may be less inclined to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, getting to know one's counterpart personally can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The biblical quote \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. When comparing their arguments, we must assume they're both discussing the same biblical God, as considering alternative divine concepts would complicate the comparison. However, while both philosophers present compelling points, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding God through internal reflection and understanding. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our minds, God must exist, as we cannot truly imagine His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its presentation, his core message is that proof of God resides within human consciousness, requiring no external evidence. This internal validation aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly useful for Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through logic rather than requiring belief in unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence, focusing on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His method resembles completing a puzzle: even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning about the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or perspectives from their readers regarding key themes. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully demonstrates several of these methods. His techniques include unconventional pairing of adjectives with nouns and the strategic use of color symbolism, particularly with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Specifically, Fitzgerald develops deep symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink throughout the novel, using these associations to trigger particular emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire: Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene.\n\nFitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: the \"white chasms\" of downtown New York, the \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment building described as part of a \"white cake of apartment-houses.\" The author also uses these colors to characterize ordinary people and places: Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and various minor characters described as \"gray.\"\n\nOnce this color symbolism is established, Fitzgerald employs it to subtly communicate character qualities, particularly with Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Daisy's portrayal in white clothing and a white car suggests her role as a uniform, almost generic object of Gatsby's desire rather than a fully developed character. This impression is reinforced through continued references to white and gray in her descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white dress\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts exceptional agricultural productivity due to its favorable climate conditions. The region produces a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, vegetables, and various fruits, along with honey and peppers. The local demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is so high that many organizations maintain substantial waiting lists. Local organic farms often combine agricultural operations with recreational opportunities, offering tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nOrganic farming presents both advantages and challenges. While it promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it typically involves higher operational costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming methods. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase management complexity and expenses, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable resources for landowners seeking to balance profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion's conservation plan. This area supports numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property has a rich historical background, starting with centuries of Native American presence, followed by late 1800s settlement by ranchers and wood sellers. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many years. The case study examined this real estate opportunity and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small-scale farmers interested in combining sustainable agriculture with wildlife conservation.",
            "The relationship between brothers is characterized by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their bond's true nature emerges, whether positive or negative. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, and understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers see their reflection in each other's eyes, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than others' perceptions of them.\n\nThis concept is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate their complex relationship against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where fierce pride collides with crushing disappointment, resulting in tragedy. The story conveys its message through the explicit portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the intricate emotions and worldview that drive the protagonist's behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their first shared moments to their final tragic encounter. He had dreamed of a brother who could match him in physical activities like breath-holding, running, climbing, and racing to Horsehead Landing. These aspirations were impossible due to Doodle's severe heart condition, which threatened his survival from birth and prevented any strenuous activity. This reality devastated the protagonist, whose youthful dreams were suddenly shattered. His frustration manifested in dark thoughts, even contemplating infanticide, though these thoughts dissipated when Doodle smiled at him, revealing an underlying, instinctive brotherly love beneath his conflicted emotions.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated system for processing information and generating creative outputs. Throughout history, people have tried to understand it through different comparisons - from ancient analogies like wax tablets and papyrus to modern parallels with computers. However, it's important to recognize that these comparisons have limitations and shouldn't be taken too literally.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo two types of processing: bottom-up, which builds understanding from basic sensory details (like identifying shapes and colors), and top-down, which uses existing knowledge to enhance perception (such as distinguishing between a solid object and a hole of the same shape).\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system that determines which information deserves focus. This system can both suppress unnecessary details (like individual grass blades in your visual field) and highlight important information (such as hearing your name in a crowded room). This filtering process occurs repeatedly throughout information processing.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different methods for various types of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be stored based on visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nScientists have proposed various models to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model, the semantic network theory, suggests that information is stored as interconnected concepts, similar to a web where related ideas (like \"chair\" and \"table\") are linked together.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis devastated the United States economy, triggering widespread unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting crucial questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves sparked a chain reaction that contaminated these repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999, during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and shareholders, was expanding mortgage access to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that an economic downturn could necessitate government intervention, similar to the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. These financial instruments created deep interconnections between the housing market and various economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported combined mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, equivalent to 30% of GDP. This resulted in the cut-rate sales of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were ultimately placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Exposition can be a tricky element in writing. While it might seem like an opportunity to showcase your literary prowess, it often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin find themselves irritated when encountering excessive information dumps in texts.\n\nHere's the harsh truth: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nThough writers are familiar with the golden rule of \"Show, don't tell,\" many still fall into the trap of writing lengthy, static passages. Exposition acts like a tempting voice, suggesting either to rush through background information or, conversely, to detail every minute aspect of characters' histories.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is straightforward narration of events. In movies, it manifests as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written works, it's direct narration from the author.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that a heroine met her future husband, had a grand wedding, and witnessed his murder - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers. Instead, the story should develop the husband's character through his actions and words, demonstrating his love for his wife. Similarly, the heroine's transformation through their relationship should be depicted through meaningful interactions and moments. This deeper characterization allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand both characters, making the husband's death more impactful.\n\nThe basic plot points \"They met, they married, he died\" need fuller development.\n\nAs an author, you must resist the urge to rapidly list character details. For instance, when introducing a new character, don't simply state their military background, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences in one quick burst. Such information dumps diminish the story's impact and reader engagement.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nThe next segment detailed a Med-Flight helicopter incident involving a .22 caliber rifle shot, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. This was followed by a brief weather report predicting weekend rain and temperatures in the mid-80s, seemingly designed to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story discussed Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez's conviction for marijuana distribution to Ohio, curiously expressing his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighting his ethnicity.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed concerning patterns in how race and ethnicity were handled in news reporting, with apparent disparities in coverage depth and emphasis depending on the subjects' backgrounds.",
            "Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that combine the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. They follow various assets, indices, or commodities while offering advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these benefits, ETFs maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, investors should note that ETF trades incur commissions similar to stock transactions. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully assess claimed advantages like diversification and their actual extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it against its top 10 holdings to evaluate whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. The study also aims to determine if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, the analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, their asset percentages were normalized to 100%, allowing for calculations of portfolio Beta and Return contributions. The results show that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo verify the statistical significance of these differences, the analysis includes an examination of standard deviations for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 shows a significant decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Several factors may explain this decrease. The winter season at a New England campus naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. Furthermore, the holiday season and subsequent academic break mean many people are absent from campus, extending into late January when spring classes begin. However, these factors don't fully explain February's low participation rates.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects naturally wanes over time. To counter this decline, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation. This highlights two key challenges: maintaining long-term engagement and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers convenience and autonomy. To encourage participation, we distributed various incentives, including gift certificates for local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project might have better sustained interest. For example, introducing larger rewards like bicycles or even hybrid/electric vehicles could have prevented the participation decline. While our initial gift card incentives proved adequate, escalating the prize value over time—such as announcing bicycle giveaways in December and a vehicle prize in January—might have maintained or even increased engagement levels instead of seeing them drop.",
            "While examining early Edison films in the Library of Congress collection, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create visual deceptions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common artistic elements in most trick films while noting the unusual characteristics that emerged in some later productions. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently featured indoor sets filmed from a fixed, front-facing perspective similar to viewing a theatrical stage. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This approach, derived from theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame without the camera following their exits.\n\nThe theatrical staging approach naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage simultaneously. The performers typically remained at a consistent distance from the camera, eliminating any opportunity for close-range shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, though this was often an illusion created through clever editing. These films typically ran for about a minute or less and focused on simple magical effects like disappearances or transformations rather than complex narratives. For instance, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears to be one continuous shot but actually contains hidden edits to achieve its special effects, particularly in the beheading sequence.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has experienced varied reception, from criticism of its superficiality to praise for its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical and contemporary romantic elements to establish a new literary genre. Walpole incorporated traditional theatrical devices with modern naturalistic storytelling to create what he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across different contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. The genre's longevity stems from its unique combination of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and fresh for readers across generations.\n\nThe concept of Chivalry stands as a fundamental Gothic element, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined the ideal knight's training and behavior, is both preserved and transformed in Walpole's work. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived moral decline in their contemporary society. Through chivalric themes, the medieval past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, likely viewed the Gothic era's supposed moral superiority as a stark contrast to his contemporary society's degradation. This perspective is exemplified through characters like Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, though often presented with Gothic literature's characteristic tendency toward excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, supply, manufacturing, and distribution to final delivery. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the entire supply chain process. During this stage, managers determine the what, when, where, and how of production by analyzing market trends to understand customer demands. Once they've assessed market needs, they make decisions about product types, quantities, and manufacturing locations, considering factors like plant capacity and quality capabilities. They then focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in production planning is crucial, as mistakes can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target implement detailed protocols for everything from employee dress codes to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations.\n\nSupply, the second key component, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes or consider outsourcing to external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while minimizing or controlling costs.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with aristocratic life. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from these typical Victorian conventions. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that were uncommon for their time, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nIn chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences the event through a dreamlike state while seeking assistance. The passage demonstrates Oliver's powerlessness during these events and his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes dulled, failing to notice who helps him, while experiencing constant pain mixed with fear rather than initial shock. This scene raises questions about the forces controlling Oliver's fate, as he appears incapable of influencing outcomes even when his life is at stake.\n\nThe passage suggests Oliver's growing sense of helplessness and possible submission to Fagin's influence, as shown by his inability to fight back or take action to save himself. This lack of resistance implies that Fagin may have succeeded in breaking Oliver's spirit, leading him to accept his desperate circumstances rather than actively resist them. The text's description of time's distortion - the swift passing of day and the paradoxically long yet brief night - further emphasizes the psychological impact of these events on Oliver.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While helping a third or fourth-grade Latino student named Adrian with his reading difficulties, I noticed unusual patterns in his letter pronunciation. Despite his perfect English speaking abilities, something seemed off. The breakthrough came when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - I realized Adrian's reading struggles stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than reading comprehension itself.\n\nThis experience illustrates the complex language barriers present in our educational system, particularly in California. It shows how language challenges aren't always obvious, even when students speak English fluently. The solution isn't one-dimensional - while Adrian needed focused help with English alphabet and pronunciation, other students with limited English proficiency require more comprehensive support. Success lies in combining various approaches: dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, offers significant benefits for all students, not just non-native English speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs typically perform better academically than their peers. While some worry about resource allocation and necessity, implementing these programs as standard practice would benefit the entire student population. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual - which would be impractical - we could employ bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this system.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions like Sunday school or Temple, or through personal introspection, we seek spiritual meaning. While many accept their inherited religious beliefs, others completely reject the notion of a higher power, embracing only their own limited perspective. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek enlightenment.\n\nOne rainy evening, I shared a moment with my father on our porch, smoking cigarettes beneath the loud tin roof. When I asked about his favorite bird, he simply replied, \"A cardinal.\" He seemed distant, gazing into the rain with a contemplative look. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose on his thinning frame, and his hair had noticeably thinned. I wanted to express how much I'd miss him, but speaking those words would make his impending death too real. Instead, I moved closer, and we sat together watching the rain in companionable silence.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The cancer treatments extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations, but only prolonged his suffering. This experience shattered my faith - I couldn't understand why a benevolent God would allow such suffering. In my solitude, I abandoned prayer, believing God had long since turned away from me.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. As someone who knew him best, I understood he wouldn't want me to watch him die. Instead, I retreated to my bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. The most painful part was that no one even bothered to inform me when it happened.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background significantly influencing his views on personal liberty and governance. His farming roots shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial processes.\n\nTaylor saw unique potential in America's ability to establish an ideal governmental system, unburdened by established traditions. He championed natural rights as interconnected elements that must remain beyond governmental control, arguing that the compromise of one right would inevitably weaken all others. He rejected the notion that society should be dominated by physical strength and cunning, as in the \"state of nature.\"\n\nTaylor advocated for a governmental structure that acknowledged humanity's dual nature of good and evil. He maintained that governmental actions reflected human virtues and vices, promoting principles that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. While he recognized self-interest as a universal human motivator, he believed it became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He emphasized the need for careful governmental oversight to contain humanity's negative tendencies.\n\nAs a Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and limited federal authority. He warned against an expansive federal government, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its high costs. However, he cautioned against purely literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached precision. My mind processed the visual information mechanically, avoiding any deeper interpretation. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, leaving no lasting impression - just pure observation of the moment.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation. Having wanted to learn drawing since childhood, I was drawn to its comprehensive approach. The book taught a technique of using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning overwhelming views into manageable compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply that framing technique. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - this scene before me could only be called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI gripped my tool, my hand moving through the air with purpose, in what might have been a profound artistic moment. The water moved smoothly, crystal-clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. Growing more frustrated, I hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, mop in hand, green tie choking my neck, contemplating this unwelcome \"gift\" left by someone for the bathroom cleaning staff. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand extensively until it resembled protective wear. Standing straight before bending forward, I lowered my hand toward the bowl, reminiscent of retrieving a holiday roast from an oven...",
            "Young drivers face significant risks on the road, with multiple factors contributing to their high accident rates. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving, while their lack of experience compounds the danger. This inexperience leads to higher instances of accidents, particularly involving speeding, rollovers, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors, as demonstrated by research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a direct link between passenger age and accident frequency. While some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers, these measures may not be sufficient.\n\nThe fundamental issue remains that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically ill-equipped to manage driving responsibilities. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, suggests that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This concern becomes more pressing as we anticipate a surge in teenage drivers from the Baby-Boomer generation's children.\n\nA potential solution would involve standardized national legislation raising the minimum driving age to 18. Under this framework, driver's education would continue in schools, but actual vehicle operation would be restricted until adulthood. The system would maintain provisional licensing and required training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's mandate of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. This nationwide approach would address the universal nature of teen driving risks and potentially reduce accident rates across all states.\n\nThis proposed legislative change, while not revolutionary, could significantly impact youth driving safety.",
            "This research paper examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three main aspects. Initially, it provides a clear definition of the condition. The paper then discusses diagnostic methods and identifying characteristics. Lastly, it explores strategies for educators to support CAPD students in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), it involves the central nervous system's ability to process and utilize sound effectively. Importantly, individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability but struggle with processing auditory information, such as distinguishing speech from background noise or separating distinct sounds.\n\nThe condition's history dates back to the 1950s, when it was initially termed \"auditory imperception.\" Notable developments include the work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961. A significant milestone was reached in 1977 with a national conference that spurred further research into childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties in: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, and interpreting auditory information meaningfully. Additionally, some individuals experience auditory masking, where one sound interferes with the processing of another.\n\nDiagnosis involves comprehensive screening procedures conducted by various professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. The diagnostic process typically combines behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, there is no single definitive diagnostic tool, and the condition's exact cause remains unknown. Advanced diagnostic methods include sophisticated acoustic testing and response measurement, often involving tasks requiring patients to process multiple simultaneous audio inputs.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on protecting abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. I bring essential values to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful conduct, ethical behavior, and a commitment to both fostering better interpersonal relationships and maintaining professional competence. These principles aren't merely professional requirements—they're deeply personal convictions.\n\nWhile I've always been drawn to helping others, my career path wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed many peers struggling with personal issues, often through unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment came that summer when I encountered a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After learning he had contacted law enforcement, I visited his parents' home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the officers' request, noting their defensive behavior and tendency to minimize serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice stands as another cornerstone of my commitment to social work. While society claims to value individuality and uniqueness, there's often pressure to conform to established norms. I've consistently challenged social injustice through personal expression and activism, whether through unconventional appearance choices, GSBA advocacy, or speaking out against discrimination and racism. My dedication to social justice isn't just professional—it's a fundamental part of who I am and will continue to be a driving force in my career.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. The paper analyzes relevant research studies to illuminate these models and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to mental disorders, and those linked to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass both Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or II disorders. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disturbances. Dyssomnias include various conditions such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia presents as excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep attacks and REM sleep abnormalities. Unlike Dyssomnias, which affect sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, including conditions like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders, particularly focusing on hypothalamic orexin neurons that regulate sleep-wake cycles. Research with mice has revealed that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety and facilitates sleep onset. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and indicate both genetic and environmental influences on sleep regulation through GABAB receptors. Any dysfunction in these receptors could necessitate medical intervention for proper sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited sleep regulation problems could significantly impact an individual's academic performance, career success, and ability to handle routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "As a student who has spent two and a half years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus mobility. During my freshman year in East Halls, specifically Stuart Hall, I faced lengthy walks of up to 25 minutes to reach central campus locations like the Willard building, especially during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation; where there once were vast empty spaces around East Halls, there are now sports facilities, new buildings including the Creamery and health services, and residential developments. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe bicycle emerges as the ideal solution for campus mobility. However, its effectiveness depends on both student adoption and appropriate infrastructure. This was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who recently returned to cycling, acknowledging it as the most practical transportation method despite its temporary decline in popularity. Cycling isn't just healthy; it's incredibly efficient – a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. It transforms what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking is an alternative, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bike, I'd spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling the most practical choice for my busy academic schedule.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed ideology. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic developments.\n\nThe novel illustrates Marxist false consciousness, where citizens are deliberately kept ignorant of true class relationships, focusing instead on personal pleasure. This is achieved through systematic conditioning, particularly evident in how lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.) are programmed to consume and indulge without questioning their reality. The World Controller's hegemonic control ensures complete dominance over these social classes, who unwittingly embrace and perpetuate the capitalist-consumerist system. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) might have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful interpersonal connections, with characters notably lacking psychological depth. This suggests Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of authentic expression and free will. Relationships remain superficial, with men objectifying women's physical attributes and women casually discussing their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their predetermined position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, demonstrating how the proletariat is manipulated into compliance through false promises of superiority, provided they maintain their consumption patterns and conformity to social norms.",
            "Reflecting on a college course in Islam I took nearly four years ago, I'm struck by how the central debate about Islam's nature as potentially hostile remains even more pertinent today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 antagonism to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic possibility of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting paradox. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portray him as someone who expanded Islam through conquest and forced conversion, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose truth naturally drew followers. This contradiction is particularly striking.\n\nThe biography contains remarkable parallels to Jesus's ministry, such as Muhammad's reported multiplication of food miracle. This apparent attempt to mirror Christian narratives seems designed to establish Muhammad as a humble prophet, though it could be interpreted as diminishing Jesus's unique divine nature by creating similar miraculous accounts.\n\nThe text frequently employs chain-narrative techniques, relating conversions through multiple layers of testimony. While intended to authenticate these accounts, this approach actually makes them less credible due to their reliance on hearsay and distant sources.\n\nPerhaps most troubling is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and gentle leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about modern Muslims' awareness of their faith's historical foundations.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with subsequent theological developments increasingly departing from its initial form. Looking at the broader picture, we observe modern society becoming more progressive and questioning traditional beliefs. While conservatives who resist change still exist, their influence may be waning. Future Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in historical accuracy, seeking to separate later doctrinal additions from Jesus's original message. Though this process may span generations, an inevitable reversal will occur: Christianity will gradually strip away accumulated doctrinal layers, moving backward through time until reaching Jesus's pure, original teachings about God's message to humanity.\n\nThis transformation, particularly in Western societies, will lead to a form of worship more closely aligned with Jesus's time. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current denominational diversity will give way to increasing uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of major historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leaders. This religious reversion will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nTo understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. By 63 BCE, when Rome took control of Jerusalem, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures. The Jewish community was diverse, split between Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "The Jungle illustrates humanity's inherent selfishness and greed, particularly through its portrayal of people's tendency to prioritize their own interests while disregarding those beneath them. This theme is most prominently displayed through the factory owners and managers' behavior. These industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. Sinclair emphasizes this through vivid imagery of industrial pollution, depicting \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrial growth.\n\nThe novel exposes the complete disregard for both environmental and human welfare. Factory owners showed no concern for the pollution their facilities produced or the unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens. More disturbingly, they demonstrated absolute indifference toward their workers' wellbeing. As described in the text, the entire system operated as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumped human dignity. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no legal protections or safety regulations to shield them.\n\nThe absence of worker protection agencies or legitimate labor advocacy organizations left employees completely vulnerable to exploitation. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected workers. The situation in Packingtown was so dire that workers' conditions were comparable to slavery, with the text noting that the predominantly immigrant workforce lived perpetually on the brink of starvation, subject to the whims of employers who were \"every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" This system made moral degradation and suffering inevitable, much like under chattel slavery.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem employs the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings, where it referred to a mythical northern island beyond Britain that Greeks considered the world's edge. However, while Virgil's influence is undeniable, Poe's German literary interests suggest another significant inspiration.\n\nThe connection to German literature is particularly evident through Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted striking similarities between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in 1808 and 1832), included \"The King of Thulé\" in Faust's second part. This poem tells the tale of a grieving king who, after his wife's death, keeps her final gift - a goblet - before ultimately throwing it into the ocean and dying.\n\nThe thematic parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly reflecting Poe's personal struggles with loss and alcohol. Poe used the term \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share similar emotional landscapes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories.\n\nPoe's awareness of Goethe's work was likely reinforced through multiple channels, including his admiration for Tennyson and exposure to various contemporary adaptations of Goethe's works, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 romantic drama version of Faust. The similarities suggest that \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as Poe's response to or reimagining of Goethe's themes.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall incident where a store manager deliberately ignored a hazardous spill. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on spilled applesauce at D&D Markets, after the manager, Paul Martin, ignored two employee notifications about the spill while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded when a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety.\n\nThe facts supporting Palmer's case include:\n- Two separate employee warnings about the spill\n- Manager's 30-minute delay in addressing the hazard\n- Five previous slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009\n- Manager's dismissive response about \"customer complaints\"\n\nThe store's history of similar incidents and the manager's conscious decision to ignore the hazard despite prior accidents strengthen Palmer's argument for punitive damages. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" may be challenging, the manager's deliberate inaction despite knowing the risks (evidenced by previous incidents) demonstrates a conscious disregard for customer safety, potentially meeting California's legal standard for punitive damages as established in Taylor v. Superior Court.",
            "Since the age of 14, she had experienced an inexplicable longing that persisted into her 17th year. Eventually, she realized it wasn't something but someone she yearned for. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none captured her interest. This peculiarity led to frequent self-reflection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations for her unusual emotional state.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with remarkably harmonious parents who rarely conflicted with their daughter, except when it came to her assertions of independence. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her genuine kindness, made her naturally charismatic.\n\nHowever, this particular day deviated from the usual calm when her mother's scream pierced through the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate transportation to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and carefully placed her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical antiseptic atmosphere and underlying tension, she remained solely focused on her mother's wellbeing. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, as it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased instances of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related mortality. The aMed diet, an adapted form of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that Mediterranean diet adherence is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. An experimental study also demonstrated its superiority over low-fat diets in weight management and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people, though stroke risks weren't specifically examined.\n\nThe study monitored 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63, all without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes, from a larger cohort of 121,700 nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The retention rate exceeded 95% throughout the 20-year study. CHD and stroke cases were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when documentation was incomplete.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for various confounding factors including age, smoking, BMI, hormonal factors, supplement use, physical activity, and other lifestyle variables.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling to analyze the data, the study found that higher Mediterranean diet adherence significantly reduced CHD and stroke risk in women. Over the 20-year period, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A photograph captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign declaring \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a street corner. This reference points to Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation under military dictatorship since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. As public participation grew, the initially tolerant government response turned violent, with military forces attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. While official records cite 13 deaths, army defector Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression is deeply rooted in history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese imperial divine status traditions, to modern political-religious alliances, authority figures have long sought absolute control. Notable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Similarly devastating examples include the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militias targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, and the Holocaust under Nazi Germany's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jewish people and other persecuted groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz stems primarily from his long career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work may be understated in many pieces, his genius lay in creating sophisticated compositions that maximized his musicians' individual talents. He developed frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisation opportunities, carefully considering each band member's unique style. This approach allowed him to craft distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of vocals \"as a jazz instrument,\" with Creole Love Call being a notable example. This piece demonstrates his skill in incorporating wordless vocals for textural effect and his ability to showcase his soloists' strengths. The twelve-bar blues composition consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. Vocals and reeds alternate in call-and-response, with vocal tones shifting from smooth to rough\n2. A muted trumpet solo elaborates the melody with extended blue notes\n3. A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by subtle syncopated piano\n4. Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's pattern between brass and reed sections\n5. The piece peaks as reeds lead the call-and-response in high register, supported by brass and rhythm sections in syncopated stop time\n6. Returns to the original format, but with vocals adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag featuring vocals and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative use of vocals as a tonal element became characteristic of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines tight orchestration with tonal experimentation, featuring \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet in dialogue with Baby Cox's scat singing, creating a seamless blend of instrumental and vocal sounds. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with distinctive flair.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might guide these evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that mathematical descriptions of biological forms were in their infancy, this observation remains relevant today. Recent advances have allowed mathematical modeling to be applied to mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (as demonstrated by Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research combines mathematical modeling and experimental work to understand how Prunum shells develop and evolve. We analyzed X-ray images of various Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling potential shell forms, we can better understand the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental data to comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space in 360-degree cycles. These rotations create whorls that spiral around a central axis called the columella. The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a line called a suture. The final and typically largest whorl is called the body whorl, while all preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base (bottom), with the animal accessing the outside through the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (facing the opening), and abapertural (opposite the opening). The standard viewing position is apertural, with the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, one should examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line. Whorls are then counted from this line in quarter-whorl increments.\n\nThe shell's growth can be understood as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked by measuring the center points of each whorl's aperture and its dimensions. This information can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing researchers to manipulate parameters and study various aspects of shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality has stagnated over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals in areas like water and sanitation, the country falls significantly behind in meeting its child and maternal health targets for 2015. This shortfall requires a comprehensive health system reform rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased its rate of professionally attended births to 72%, this figure is somewhat deceptive as it includes traditional midwives who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like hemorrhage. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nRegarding improvement strategies, Indonesia faces a choice between targeted programmatic approaches and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer clear objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other healthcare areas (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impacts on family planning) and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved to encompass such a vast array of genres that creating a complete list has become challenging. The complexity increases as major genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal genre has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly difficult. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend modern metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It's often described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, volume, violence, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands sophisticated musicianship, with band members typically displaying advanced instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, resulting in experimental, otherworldly compositions. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This is exemplified in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, which was created as a response to compete with the Rolling Stones' heavier sound and appeared on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, depicts both a woman's wonderment in her dream state and symbolizes Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional artistic styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand this work's significance, context is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful tinsmith. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training and worked as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy struck when his first wife Clémence died, following the loss of eight of their children, leaving him with only his daughter Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. As a self-taught folk artist, his perspective differed from his peers who often idealized peasant life in their works.\n\nRousseau's desperate desire for acceptance in the art world becomes clearer considering his circumstances: he began his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, during an era of established artistic giants. His recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rising fame, though their artistic motivations contrasted sharply. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventionality to gain acceptance from the artistic establishment.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted the strong relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty, between what is true and what is beautiful. This connection appears to exist at a fundamental level, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come naturally. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, as we typically analyze why something is considered beautiful or moral rather than establishing rigid rules for creating art or determining ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, neither artistic nor moral criticism can completely explain what makes something truly good or beautiful. When discussing great artwork like the Mona Lisa, we might analyze technical elements and context, but these alone don't fully explain its greatness. People often preface their appreciation with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This transcendent aspect exists in both art and morality, as noted by writers like Flannery O'Connor, who suggests that some truths can only be conveyed through storytelling rather than direct statements.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that defies complete rational explanation - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral dimensions. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive quality lies in its moral nature, making it particularly relevant to human life and values, as living itself inherently involves moral choices.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural tapestry emerged from diverse tribal and historical origins.\n\nThe historical homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins remain contentious among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungri tribe, formerly called Germans, who had crossed the Rhine to fight the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars accounts, borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, derive from \"ger\" (spear), or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups due to their land's inhospitable nature. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh environment over more hospitable regions unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans maintained a complex relationship with Germania, primarily focusing on trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity become permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception presents a challenging dilemma: choosing between maintaining one's authentic self or preserving relationships with those who may feel betrayed by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions about motivation and necessity. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a social cost, isolating her from female companionship while creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and challenge social conventions. The reactions of both Olivia and Orsino to Viola/Cesario suggest underlying complexities in their understanding of attraction and identity. However, Olivia's quick transition from loving Cesario to accepting Sebastian suggests that Shakespeare may be satirizing superficial attraction rather than exploring deeper questions of sexual identity. This interpretation is reinforced by the play's resolution, where Olivia readily accepts Viola as a sister rather than a former love interest, demonstrating the fluid nature of relationships once truth replaces deception.",
            "The German colonial empire exhibited varying degrees of administrative approaches, despite being commonly associated with brutality, particularly regarding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. Educational policies across German colonies showed significant disparities. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German territories.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (now Namibia) demonstrated markedly different circumstances. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational initiatives, South West Africa relegated native education primarily to missionary organizations with minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This educational disparity resulted in a largely uneducated and illiterate indigenous population, contrasting sharply with other German colonies' achievements.\n\nThe academic literature on German colonial education is extensive, predominantly comprising German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused on describing colonial educational systems, while later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research particularly stands out for its comparative analysis of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many educational differences to South West Africa's larger settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its largely desert terrain, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's educational policies and social structure.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico exemplifies a prolonged international rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), this 57-year period was marked most notably by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the US defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. The antagonism between these nations was rooted in fundamental differences in religion, culture, and material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974).\n\nThis pattern of rivalry is common among neighboring countries, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests. Pletcher (1977) highlights that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have experienced sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) observes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide stemmed from inherited antagonisms between English Protestants and Spanish Catholics, significantly hampering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes, primarily concerning territorial issues and border security. Both nations struggled with cross-border raids and frontier violence until they established stronger military presence along their boundaries (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry eventually diminished in the late 19th century when, according to Schmitt (1974), Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico.",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse – a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science and journalism – I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's kept me going isn't personal strength alone, but the crucial support of family and friends. This experience taught me that even the strongest among us need help when facing life's major challenges.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some obstacles are simply too massive to tackle alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support – which is already strained – I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual assistance rather than retreating into isolated self-reliance.\n\nThe popular conservative notion of \"rugged individualism\" as America's foundation is somewhat misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. Consider the pioneer wagon trains – their success depended on collaboration, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for preparedness – I maintain emergency supplies, including first-aid kits, water purification tools, and non-perishable food. I encourage others to prepare similarly if they have the means. However, equally important is building connections with your community. Knowing and supporting your neighbors is as crucial as any emergency kit.",
            "Around 500-600 BCE, the individual who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings established Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. As this faith approaches its 2,500th anniversary, it has evolved considerably from its original form. This evolution is evident in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, though religiously significant to both monks and lay practitioners, was never part of Buddha's original teachings. These changes extend beyond mere rituals to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community (Buddhasasana), regardless of whether they come from monks or laypeople. External forces stem from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral, though their actions may inadvertently help or harm the Buddhist community.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on seeking refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka (three baskets) of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is crucial for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The faith prescribes five basic precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow additional rules. The foundation of Buddhist teaching lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering (Dukkha), its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is crucial in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share specific traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically impact their current negotiation and influence discussions. People naturally interpret other cultures through the lens of their own experiences.\n\nTo effectively engage with different cultures, one must invest time in understanding their historical context and inherent biases. Success in negotiations requires accepting cultural differences rather than trying to modify them, particularly when operating from a position of lesser influence. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs helps overcome cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Each company develops its unique corporate culture, visible in various aspects such as work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and charitable activities. Even within the same country, corporate cultures can vary significantly between companies and across different locations. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous than others, deeper examination often reveals subtle but important distinctions.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is essential as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment of their organization or leaders to achieve success. Similarly, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may be less inclined to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, getting to know one's counterpart personally can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The biblical quote \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. When comparing their arguments, we must assume they're both discussing the same biblical God, as considering alternative divine concepts would complicate the comparison. However, while both philosophers present compelling points, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding God through internal reflection and understanding. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our minds, God must exist, as we cannot truly imagine His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its presentation, his core message is that proof of God resides within human consciousness, requiring no external evidence. This internal validation aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly useful for Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through logic rather than requiring belief in unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence, focusing on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His method resembles completing a puzzle: even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning about the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or perspectives from their readers regarding key themes. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully demonstrates several of these methods. His techniques include unconventional pairing of adjectives with nouns and the strategic use of color symbolism, particularly with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Specifically, Fitzgerald develops deep symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink throughout the novel, using these associations to trigger particular emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire: Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene.\n\nFitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: the \"white chasms\" of downtown New York, the \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment building described as part of a \"white cake of apartment-houses.\" The author also uses these colors to characterize ordinary people and places: Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and various minor characters described as \"gray.\"\n\nOnce this color symbolism is established, Fitzgerald employs it to subtly communicate character qualities, particularly with Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Daisy's portrayal in white clothing and a white car suggests her role as a uniform, almost generic object of Gatsby's desire rather than a fully developed character. This impression is reinforced through continued references to white and gray in her descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white dress\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts exceptional agricultural productivity due to its favorable climate conditions. The region produces a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, vegetables, and various fruits, along with honey and peppers. The local demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is so high that many organizations maintain substantial waiting lists. Local organic farms often combine agricultural operations with recreational opportunities, offering tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nOrganic farming presents both advantages and challenges. While it promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it typically involves higher operational costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming methods. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase management complexity and expenses, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable resources for landowners seeking to balance profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion's conservation plan. This area supports numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property has a rich historical background, starting with centuries of Native American presence, followed by late 1800s settlement by ranchers and wood sellers. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many years. The case study examined this real estate opportunity and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small-scale farmers interested in combining sustainable agriculture with wildlife conservation.",
            "The relationship between brothers is characterized by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their bond's true nature emerges, whether positive or negative. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, and understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers see their reflection in each other's eyes, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than others' perceptions of them.\n\nThis concept is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate their complex relationship against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where fierce pride collides with crushing disappointment, resulting in tragedy. The story conveys its message through the explicit portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the intricate emotions and worldview that drive the protagonist's behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their first shared moments to their final tragic encounter. He had dreamed of a brother who could match him in physical activities like breath-holding, running, climbing, and racing to Horsehead Landing. These aspirations were impossible due to Doodle's severe heart condition, which threatened his survival from birth and prevented any strenuous activity. This reality devastated the protagonist, whose youthful dreams were suddenly shattered. His frustration manifested in dark thoughts, even contemplating infanticide, though these thoughts dissipated when Doodle smiled at him, revealing an underlying, instinctive brotherly love beneath his conflicted emotions.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated system for processing information and generating creative outputs. Throughout history, people have tried to understand it through different comparisons - from ancient analogies like wax tablets and papyrus to modern parallels with computers. However, it's important to recognize that these comparisons have limitations and shouldn't be taken too literally.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo two types of processing: bottom-up, which builds understanding from basic sensory details (like identifying shapes and colors), and top-down, which uses existing knowledge to enhance perception (such as distinguishing between a solid object and a hole of the same shape).\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system that determines which information deserves focus. This system can both suppress unnecessary details (like individual grass blades in your visual field) and highlight important information (such as hearing your name in a crowded room). This filtering process occurs repeatedly throughout information processing.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different methods for various types of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be stored based on visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nScientists have proposed various models to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model, the semantic network theory, suggests that information is stored as interconnected concepts, similar to a web where related ideas (like \"chair\" and \"table\") are linked together.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis devastated the United States economy, triggering widespread unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting crucial questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. Additionally, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves sparked a chain reaction that contaminated these repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999, during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and shareholders, was expanding mortgage access to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that an economic downturn could necessitate government intervention, similar to the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. These financial instruments created deep interconnections between the housing market and various economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported combined mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, equivalent to 30% of GDP. This resulted in the cut-rate sales of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were ultimately placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Exposition can be a tricky element in writing. While it might seem like an opportunity to showcase your literary prowess, it often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin find themselves irritated when encountering excessive information dumps in texts.\n\nHere's the harsh truth: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nThough writers are familiar with the golden rule of \"Show, don't tell,\" many still fall into the trap of writing lengthy, static passages. Exposition acts like a tempting voice, suggesting either to rush through background information or, conversely, to detail every minute aspect of characters' histories.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is straightforward narration of events. In movies, it manifests as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written works, it's direct narration from the author.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that a heroine met her future husband, had a grand wedding, and witnessed his murder - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers. Instead, the story should develop the husband's character through his actions and words, demonstrating his love for his wife. Similarly, the heroine's transformation through their relationship should be depicted through meaningful interactions and moments. This deeper characterization allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand both characters, making the husband's death more impactful.\n\nThe basic plot points \"They met, they married, he died\" need fuller development.\n\nAs an author, you must resist the urge to rapidly list character details. For instance, when introducing a new character, don't simply state their military background, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences in one quick burst. Such information dumps diminish the story's impact and reader engagement.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nThe next segment detailed a Med-Flight helicopter incident involving a .22 caliber rifle shot, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. This was followed by a brief weather report predicting weekend rain and temperatures in the mid-80s, seemingly designed to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story discussed Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez's conviction for marijuana distribution to Ohio, curiously expressing his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighting his ethnicity.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed concerning patterns in how race and ethnicity were handled in news reporting, with apparent disparities in coverage depth and emphasis depending on the subjects' backgrounds.",
            "Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that combine the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. They follow various assets, indices, or commodities while offering advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these benefits, ETFs maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, investors should note that ETF trades incur commissions similar to stock transactions. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully assess claimed advantages like diversification and their actual extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it against its top 10 holdings to evaluate whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. The study also aims to determine if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, the analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, their asset percentages were normalized to 100%, allowing for calculations of portfolio Beta and Return contributions. The results show that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo verify the statistical significance of these differences, the analysis includes an examination of standard deviations for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 shows a significant decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Several factors may explain this decrease. The winter season at a New England campus naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. Furthermore, the holiday season and subsequent academic break mean many people are absent from campus, extending into late January when spring classes begin. However, these factors don't fully explain February's low participation rates.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects naturally wanes over time. To counter this decline, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation. This highlights two key challenges: maintaining long-term engagement and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers convenience and autonomy. To encourage participation, we distributed various incentives, including gift certificates for local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project might have better sustained interest. For example, introducing larger rewards like bicycles or even hybrid/electric vehicles could have prevented the participation decline. While our initial gift card incentives proved adequate, escalating the prize value over time—such as announcing bicycle giveaways in December and a vehicle prize in January—might have maintained or even increased engagement levels instead of seeing them drop.",
            "While examining early Edison films in the Library of Congress collection, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create visual deceptions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common artistic elements in most trick films while noting the unusual characteristics that emerged in some later productions. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently featured indoor sets filmed from a fixed, front-facing perspective similar to viewing a theatrical stage. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This approach, derived from theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame without the camera following their exits.\n\nThe theatrical staging approach naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage simultaneously. The performers typically remained at a consistent distance from the camera, eliminating any opportunity for close-range shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, though this was often an illusion created through clever editing. These films typically ran for about a minute or less and focused on simple magical effects like disappearances or transformations rather than complex narratives. For instance, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears to be one continuous shot but actually contains hidden edits to achieve its special effects, particularly in the beheading sequence.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has experienced varied reception, from criticism of its superficiality to praise for its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical and contemporary romantic elements to establish a new literary genre. Walpole incorporated traditional theatrical devices with modern naturalistic storytelling to create what he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across different contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. The genre's longevity stems from its unique combination of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and fresh for readers across generations.\n\nThe concept of Chivalry stands as a fundamental Gothic element, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined the ideal knight's training and behavior, is both preserved and transformed in Walpole's work. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived moral decline in their contemporary society. Through chivalric themes, the medieval past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, likely viewed the Gothic era's supposed moral superiority as a stark contrast to his contemporary society's degradation. This perspective is exemplified through characters like Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, though often presented with Gothic literature's characteristic tendency toward excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, supply, manufacturing, and distribution to final delivery. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the entire supply chain process. During this stage, managers determine the what, when, where, and how of production by analyzing market trends to understand customer demands. Once they've assessed market needs, they make decisions about product types, quantities, and manufacturing locations, considering factors like plant capacity and quality capabilities. They then focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in production planning is crucial, as mistakes can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target implement detailed protocols for everything from employee dress codes to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations.\n\nSupply, the second key component, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes or consider outsourcing to external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while minimizing or controlling costs.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with aristocratic life. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from these typical Victorian conventions. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that were uncommon for their time, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nIn chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences the event through a dreamlike state while seeking assistance. The passage demonstrates Oliver's powerlessness during these events and his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes dulled, failing to notice who helps him, while experiencing constant pain mixed with fear rather than initial shock. This scene raises questions about the forces controlling Oliver's fate, as he appears incapable of influencing outcomes even when his life is at stake.\n\nThe passage suggests Oliver's growing sense of helplessness and possible submission to Fagin's influence, as shown by his inability to fight back or take action to save himself. This lack of resistance implies that Fagin may have succeeded in breaking Oliver's spirit, leading him to accept his desperate circumstances rather than actively resist them. The text's description of time's distortion - the swift passing of day and the paradoxically long yet brief night - further emphasizes the psychological impact of these events on Oliver.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While helping a third or fourth-grade Latino student named Adrian with his reading difficulties, I noticed unusual patterns in his letter pronunciation. Despite his perfect English speaking abilities, something seemed off. The breakthrough came when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - I realized Adrian's reading struggles stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than reading comprehension itself.\n\nThis experience illustrates the complex language barriers present in our educational system, particularly in California. It shows how language challenges aren't always obvious, even when students speak English fluently. The solution isn't one-dimensional - while Adrian needed focused help with English alphabet and pronunciation, other students with limited English proficiency require more comprehensive support. Success lies in combining various approaches: dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, offers significant benefits for all students, not just non-native English speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs typically perform better academically than their peers. While some worry about resource allocation and necessity, implementing these programs as standard practice would benefit the entire student population. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual - which would be impractical - we could employ bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this system.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions like Sunday school or Temple, or through personal introspection, we seek spiritual meaning. While many accept their inherited religious beliefs, others completely reject the notion of a higher power, embracing only their own limited perspective. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek enlightenment.\n\nOne rainy evening, I shared a moment with my father on our porch, smoking cigarettes beneath the loud tin roof. When I asked about his favorite bird, he simply replied, \"A cardinal.\" He seemed distant, gazing into the rain with a contemplative look. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose on his thinning frame, and his hair had noticeably thinned. I wanted to express how much I'd miss him, but speaking those words would make his impending death too real. Instead, I moved closer, and we sat together watching the rain in companionable silence.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The cancer treatments extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations, but only prolonged his suffering. This experience shattered my faith - I couldn't understand why a benevolent God would allow such suffering. In my solitude, I abandoned prayer, believing God had long since turned away from me.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. As someone who knew him best, I understood he wouldn't want me to watch him die. Instead, I retreated to my bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. The most painful part was that no one even bothered to inform me when it happened.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background significantly influencing his views on personal liberty and governance. His farming roots shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial processes.\n\nTaylor saw unique potential in America's ability to establish an ideal governmental system, unburdened by established traditions. He championed natural rights as interconnected elements that must remain beyond governmental control, arguing that the compromise of one right would inevitably weaken all others. He rejected the notion that society should be dominated by physical strength and cunning, as in the \"state of nature.\"\n\nTaylor advocated for a governmental structure that acknowledged humanity's dual nature of good and evil. He maintained that governmental actions reflected human virtues and vices, promoting principles that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. While he recognized self-interest as a universal human motivator, he believed it became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He emphasized the need for careful governmental oversight to contain humanity's negative tendencies.\n\nAs a Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and limited federal authority. He warned against an expansive federal government, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its high costs. However, he cautioned against purely literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached precision. My mind processed the visual information mechanically, avoiding any deeper interpretation. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, leaving no lasting impression - just pure observation of the moment.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation. Having wanted to learn drawing since childhood, I was drawn to its comprehensive approach. The book taught a technique of using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning overwhelming views into manageable compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply that framing technique. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - this scene before me could only be called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI gripped my tool, my hand moving through the air with purpose, in what might have been a profound artistic moment. The water moved smoothly, crystal-clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. Growing more frustrated, I hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, mop in hand, green tie choking my neck, contemplating this unwelcome \"gift\" left by someone for the bathroom cleaning staff. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand extensively until it resembled protective wear. Standing straight before bending forward, I lowered my hand toward the bowl, reminiscent of retrieving a holiday roast from an oven...",
            "Young drivers face significant risks on the road, with multiple factors contributing to their high accident rates. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving, while their lack of experience compounds the danger. This inexperience leads to higher instances of accidents, particularly involving speeding, rollovers, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors, as demonstrated by research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a direct link between passenger age and accident frequency. While some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers, these measures may not be sufficient.\n\nThe fundamental issue remains that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically ill-equipped to manage driving responsibilities. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, suggests that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This concern becomes more pressing as we anticipate a surge in teenage drivers from the Baby-Boomer generation's children.\n\nA potential solution would involve standardized national legislation raising the minimum driving age to 18. Under this framework, driver's education would continue in schools, but actual vehicle operation would be restricted until adulthood. The system would maintain provisional licensing and required training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's mandate of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. This nationwide approach would address the universal nature of teen driving risks and potentially reduce accident rates across all states.\n\nThis proposed legislative change, while not revolutionary, could significantly impact youth driving safety.",
            "This research paper examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three main aspects. Initially, it provides a clear definition of the condition. The paper then discusses diagnostic methods and identifying characteristics. Lastly, it explores strategies for educators to support CAPD students in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), it involves the central nervous system's ability to process and utilize sound effectively. Importantly, individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability but struggle with processing auditory information, such as distinguishing speech from background noise or separating distinct sounds.\n\nThe condition's history dates back to the 1950s, when it was initially termed \"auditory imperception.\" Notable developments include the work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961. A significant milestone was reached in 1977 with a national conference that spurred further research into childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties in: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, and interpreting auditory information meaningfully. Additionally, some individuals experience auditory masking, where one sound interferes with the processing of another.\n\nDiagnosis involves comprehensive screening procedures conducted by various professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. The diagnostic process typically combines behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, there is no single definitive diagnostic tool, and the condition's exact cause remains unknown. Advanced diagnostic methods include sophisticated acoustic testing and response measurement, often involving tasks requiring patients to process multiple simultaneous audio inputs.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on protecting abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. I bring essential values to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful conduct, ethical behavior, and a commitment to both fostering better interpersonal relationships and maintaining professional competence. These principles aren't merely professional requirements—they're deeply personal convictions.\n\nWhile I've always been drawn to helping others, my career path wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed many peers struggling with personal issues, often through unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment came that summer when I encountered a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After learning he had contacted law enforcement, I visited his parents' home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the officers' request, noting their defensive behavior and tendency to minimize serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice stands as another cornerstone of my commitment to social work. While society claims to value individuality and uniqueness, there's often pressure to conform to established norms. I've consistently challenged social injustice through personal expression and activism, whether through unconventional appearance choices, GSBA advocacy, or speaking out against discrimination and racism. My dedication to social justice isn't just professional—it's a fundamental part of who I am and will continue to be a driving force in my career.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. The paper analyzes relevant research studies to illuminate these models and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to mental disorders, and those linked to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass both Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or II disorders. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disturbances. Dyssomnias include various conditions such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia presents as excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep attacks and REM sleep abnormalities. Unlike Dyssomnias, which affect sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, including conditions like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders, particularly focusing on hypothalamic orexin neurons that regulate sleep-wake cycles. Research with mice has revealed that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety and facilitates sleep onset. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and indicate both genetic and environmental influences on sleep regulation through GABAB receptors. Any dysfunction in these receptors could necessitate medical intervention for proper sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited sleep regulation problems could significantly impact an individual's academic performance, career success, and ability to handle routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "As a student who has spent two and a half years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus mobility. During my freshman year in East Halls, specifically Stuart Hall, I faced lengthy walks of up to 25 minutes to reach central campus locations like the Willard building, especially during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation; where there once were vast empty spaces around East Halls, there are now sports facilities, new buildings including the Creamery and health services, and residential developments. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe bicycle emerges as the ideal solution for campus mobility. However, its effectiveness depends on both student adoption and appropriate infrastructure. This was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who recently returned to cycling, acknowledging it as the most practical transportation method despite its temporary decline in popularity. Cycling isn't just healthy; it's incredibly efficient – a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. It transforms what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking is an alternative, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bike, I'd spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling the most practical choice for my busy academic schedule.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed ideology. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic developments.\n\nThe novel illustrates Marxist false consciousness, where citizens are deliberately kept ignorant of true class relationships, focusing instead on personal pleasure. This is achieved through systematic conditioning, particularly evident in how lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.) are programmed to consume and indulge without questioning their reality. The World Controller's hegemonic control ensures complete dominance over these social classes, who unwittingly embrace and perpetuate the capitalist-consumerist system. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) might have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful interpersonal connections, with characters notably lacking psychological depth. This suggests Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of authentic expression and free will. Relationships remain superficial, with men objectifying women's physical attributes and women casually discussing their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their predetermined position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, demonstrating how the proletariat is manipulated into compliance through false promises of superiority, provided they maintain their consumption patterns and conformity to social norms.",
            "Reflecting on a college course in Islam I took nearly four years ago, I'm struck by how the central debate about Islam's nature as potentially hostile remains even more pertinent today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 antagonism to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic possibility of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting paradox. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portray him as someone who expanded Islam through conquest and forced conversion, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose truth naturally drew followers. This contradiction is particularly striking.\n\nThe biography contains remarkable parallels to Jesus's ministry, such as Muhammad's reported multiplication of food miracle. This apparent attempt to mirror Christian narratives seems designed to establish Muhammad as a humble prophet, though it could be interpreted as diminishing Jesus's unique divine nature by creating similar miraculous accounts.\n\nThe text frequently employs chain-narrative techniques, relating conversions through multiple layers of testimony. While intended to authenticate these accounts, this approach actually makes them less credible due to their reliance on hearsay and distant sources.\n\nPerhaps most troubling is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and gentle leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about modern Muslims' awareness of their faith's historical foundations.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with subsequent theological developments increasingly departing from its initial form. Looking at the broader picture, we observe modern society becoming more progressive and questioning traditional beliefs. While conservatives who resist change still exist, their influence may be waning. Future Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in historical accuracy, seeking to separate later doctrinal additions from Jesus's original message. Though this process may span generations, an inevitable reversal will occur: Christianity will gradually strip away accumulated doctrinal layers, moving backward through time until reaching Jesus's pure, original teachings about God's message to humanity.\n\nThis transformation, particularly in Western societies, will lead to a form of worship more closely aligned with Jesus's time. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current denominational diversity will give way to increasing uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of major historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leaders. This religious reversion will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nTo understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. By 63 BCE, when Rome took control of Jerusalem, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures. The Jewish community was diverse, split between Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "The Jungle illustrates humanity's inherent selfishness and greed, particularly through its portrayal of people's tendency to prioritize their own interests while disregarding those beneath them. This theme is most prominently displayed through the factory owners and managers' behavior. These industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. Sinclair emphasizes this through vivid imagery of industrial pollution, depicting \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrial growth.\n\nThe novel exposes the complete disregard for both environmental and human welfare. Factory owners showed no concern for the pollution their facilities produced or the unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens. More disturbingly, they demonstrated absolute indifference toward their workers' wellbeing. As described in the text, the entire system operated as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumped human dignity. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no legal protections or safety regulations to shield them.\n\nThe absence of worker protection agencies or legitimate labor advocacy organizations left employees completely vulnerable to exploitation. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected workers. The situation in Packingtown was so dire that workers' conditions were comparable to slavery, with the text noting that the predominantly immigrant workforce lived perpetually on the brink of starvation, subject to the whims of employers who were \"every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" This system made moral degradation and suffering inevitable, much like under chattel slavery.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem employs the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings, where it referred to a mythical northern island beyond Britain that Greeks considered the world's edge. However, while Virgil's influence is undeniable, Poe's German literary interests suggest another significant inspiration.\n\nThe connection to German literature is particularly evident through Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted striking similarities between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in 1808 and 1832), included \"The King of Thulé\" in Faust's second part. This poem tells the tale of a grieving king who, after his wife's death, keeps her final gift - a goblet - before ultimately throwing it into the ocean and dying.\n\nThe thematic parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly reflecting Poe's personal struggles with loss and alcohol. Poe used the term \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share similar emotional landscapes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories.\n\nPoe's awareness of Goethe's work was likely reinforced through multiple channels, including his admiration for Tennyson and exposure to various contemporary adaptations of Goethe's works, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 romantic drama version of Faust. The similarities suggest that \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as Poe's response to or reimagining of Goethe's themes.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall incident where a store manager deliberately ignored a hazardous spill. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on spilled applesauce at D&D Markets, after the manager, Paul Martin, ignored two employee notifications about the spill while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded when a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety.\n\nThe facts supporting Palmer's case include:\n- Two separate employee warnings about the spill\n- Manager's 30-minute delay in addressing the hazard\n- Five previous slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009\n- Manager's dismissive response about \"customer complaints\"\n\nThe store's history of similar incidents and the manager's conscious decision to ignore the hazard despite prior accidents strengthen Palmer's argument for punitive damages. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" may be challenging, the manager's deliberate inaction despite knowing the risks (evidenced by previous incidents) demonstrates a conscious disregard for customer safety, potentially meeting California's legal standard for punitive damages as established in Taylor v. Superior Court.",
            "Since the age of 14, she had experienced an inexplicable longing that persisted into her 17th year. Eventually, she realized it wasn't something but someone she yearned for. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none captured her interest. This peculiarity led to frequent self-reflection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations for her unusual emotional state.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with remarkably harmonious parents who rarely conflicted with their daughter, except when it came to her assertions of independence. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her genuine kindness, made her naturally charismatic.\n\nHowever, this particular day deviated from the usual calm when her mother's scream pierced through the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate transportation to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and carefully placed her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical antiseptic atmosphere and underlying tension, she remained solely focused on her mother's wellbeing. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, as it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased instances of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related mortality. The aMed diet, an adapted form of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that Mediterranean diet adherence is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. An experimental study also demonstrated its superiority over low-fat diets in weight management and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people, though stroke risks weren't specifically examined.\n\nThe study monitored 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63, all without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes, from a larger cohort of 121,700 nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The retention rate exceeded 95% throughout the 20-year study. CHD and stroke cases were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when documentation was incomplete.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for various confounding factors including age, smoking, BMI, hormonal factors, supplement use, physical activity, and other lifestyle variables.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling to analyze the data, the study found that higher Mediterranean diet adherence significantly reduced CHD and stroke risk in women. Over the 20-year period, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A photograph captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign declaring \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a street corner. This reference points to Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation under military dictatorship since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. As public participation grew, the initially tolerant government response turned violent, with military forces attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. While official records cite 13 deaths, army defector Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression is deeply rooted in history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese imperial divine status traditions, to modern political-religious alliances, authority figures have long sought absolute control. Notable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Similarly devastating examples include the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militias targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, and the Holocaust under Nazi Germany's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jewish people and other persecuted groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz stems primarily from his long career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work may be understated in many pieces, his genius lay in creating sophisticated compositions that maximized his musicians' individual talents. He developed frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisation opportunities, carefully considering each band member's unique style. This approach allowed him to craft distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of vocals \"as a jazz instrument,\" with Creole Love Call being a notable example. This piece demonstrates his skill in incorporating wordless vocals for textural effect and his ability to showcase his soloists' strengths. The twelve-bar blues composition consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. Vocals and reeds alternate in call-and-response, with vocal tones shifting from smooth to rough\n2. A muted trumpet solo elaborates the melody with extended blue notes\n3. A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by subtle syncopated piano\n4. Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's pattern between brass and reed sections\n5. The piece peaks as reeds lead the call-and-response in high register, supported by brass and rhythm sections in syncopated stop time\n6. Returns to the original format, but with vocals adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag featuring vocals and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative use of vocals as a tonal element became characteristic of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines tight orchestration with tonal experimentation, featuring \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet in dialogue with Baby Cox's scat singing, creating a seamless blend of instrumental and vocal sounds. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with distinctive flair.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might guide these evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that mathematical descriptions of biological forms were in their infancy, this observation remains relevant today. Recent advances have allowed mathematical modeling to be applied to mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (as demonstrated by Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research combines mathematical modeling and experimental work to understand how Prunum shells develop and evolve. We analyzed X-ray images of various Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling potential shell forms, we can better understand the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental data to comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space in 360-degree cycles. These rotations create whorls that spiral around a central axis called the columella. The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a line called a suture. The final and typically largest whorl is called the body whorl, while all preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base (bottom), with the animal accessing the outside through the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (facing the opening), and abapertural (opposite the opening). The standard viewing position is apertural, with the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, one should examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line. Whorls are then counted from this line in quarter-whorl increments.\n\nThe shell's growth can be understood as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked by measuring the center points of each whorl's aperture and its dimensions. This information can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing researchers to manipulate parameters and study various aspects of shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality has stagnated over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals in areas like water and sanitation, the country falls significantly behind in meeting its child and maternal health targets for 2015. This shortfall requires a comprehensive health system reform rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased its rate of professionally attended births to 72%, this figure is somewhat deceptive as it includes traditional midwives who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like hemorrhage. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nRegarding improvement strategies, Indonesia faces a choice between targeted programmatic approaches and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer clear objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other healthcare areas (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impacts on family planning) and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved to encompass such a vast array of genres that creating a complete list has become challenging. The complexity increases as major genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal genre has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly difficult. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend modern metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It's often described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, volume, violence, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands sophisticated musicianship, with band members typically displaying advanced instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, resulting in experimental, otherworldly compositions. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This is exemplified in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, which was created as a response to compete with the Rolling Stones' heavier sound and appeared on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, depicts both a woman's wonderment in her dream state and symbolizes Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional artistic styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand this work's significance, context is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful tinsmith. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training and worked as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy struck when his first wife Clémence died, following the loss of eight of their children, leaving him with only his daughter Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. As a self-taught folk artist, his perspective differed from his peers who often idealized peasant life in their works.\n\nRousseau's desperate desire for acceptance in the art world becomes clearer considering his circumstances: he began his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, during an era of established artistic giants. His recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rising fame, though their artistic motivations contrasted sharply. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventionality to gain acceptance from the artistic establishment.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted the strong relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty, between what is true and what is beautiful. This connection appears to exist at a fundamental level, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come naturally. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, as we typically analyze why something is considered beautiful or moral rather than establishing rigid rules for creating art or determining ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, neither artistic nor moral criticism can completely explain what makes something truly good or beautiful. When discussing great artwork like the Mona Lisa, we might analyze technical elements and context, but these alone don't fully explain its greatness. People often preface their appreciation with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This transcendent aspect exists in both art and morality, as noted by writers like Flannery O'Connor, who suggests that some truths can only be conveyed through storytelling rather than direct statements.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that defies complete rational explanation - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral dimensions. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive quality lies in its moral nature, making it particularly relevant to human life and values, as living itself inherently involves moral choices.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural tapestry emerged from diverse tribal and historical origins.\n\nThe historical homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins remain contentious among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungri tribe, formerly called Germans, who had crossed the Rhine to fight the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars accounts, borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, derive from \"ger\" (spear), or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups due to their land's inhospitable nature. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh environment over more hospitable regions unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans maintained a complex relationship with Germania, primarily focusing on trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity become permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception presents a challenging dilemma: choosing between maintaining one's authentic self or preserving relationships with those who may feel betrayed by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions about motivation and necessity. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a social cost, isolating her from female companionship while creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and challenge social conventions. The reactions of both Olivia and Orsino to Viola/Cesario suggest underlying complexities in their understanding of attraction and identity. However, Olivia's quick transition from loving Cesario to accepting Sebastian suggests that Shakespeare may be satirizing superficial attraction rather than exploring deeper questions of sexual identity. This interpretation is reinforced by the play's resolution, where Olivia readily accepts Viola as a sister rather than a former love interest, demonstrating the fluid nature of relationships once truth replaces deception.",
            "The German colonial empire exhibited varying degrees of administrative approaches, despite being commonly associated with brutality, particularly regarding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. Educational policies across German colonies showed significant disparities. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German territories.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (now Namibia) demonstrated markedly different circumstances. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational initiatives, South West Africa relegated native education primarily to missionary organizations with minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This educational disparity resulted in a largely uneducated and illiterate indigenous population, contrasting sharply with other German colonies' achievements.\n\nThe academic literature on German colonial education is extensive, predominantly comprising German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused on describing colonial educational systems, while later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research particularly stands out for its comparative analysis of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many educational differences to South West Africa's larger settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its largely desert terrain, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's educational policies and social structure.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico exemplifies a prolonged international rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), this 57-year period was marked most notably by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the US defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. The antagonism between these nations was rooted in fundamental differences in religion, culture, and material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974).\n\nThis pattern of rivalry is common among neighboring countries, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests. Pletcher (1977) highlights that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have experienced sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) observes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide stemmed from inherited antagonisms between English Protestants and Spanish Catholics, significantly hampering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes, primarily concerning territorial issues and border security. Both nations struggled with cross-border raids and frontier violence until they established stronger military presence along their boundaries (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry eventually diminished in the late 19th century when, according to Schmitt (1974), Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico.",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse – a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science and journalism – I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's kept me going isn't personal strength alone, but the crucial support of family and friends. This experience taught me that even the strongest among us need help when facing life's major challenges.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some obstacles are simply too massive to tackle alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support – which is already strained – I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual assistance rather than retreating into isolated self-reliance.\n\nThe popular conservative notion of \"rugged individualism\" as America's foundation is somewhat misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. Consider the pioneer wagon trains – their success depended on collaboration, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for preparedness – I maintain emergency supplies, including first-aid kits, water purification tools, and non-perishable food. I encourage others to prepare similarly if they have the means. However, equally important is building connections with your community. Knowing and supporting your neighbors is as crucial as any emergency kit.",
            "Around 500-600 BCE, the individual who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings established Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. As this faith approaches its 2,500th anniversary, it has evolved considerably from its original form. This evolution is evident in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, though religiously significant to both monks and lay practitioners, was never part of Buddha's original teachings. These changes extend beyond mere rituals to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community (Buddhasasana), regardless of whether they come from monks or laypeople. External forces stem from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral, though their actions may inadvertently help or harm the Buddhist community.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on seeking refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka (three baskets) of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is crucial for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The faith prescribes five basic precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow additional rules. The foundation of Buddhist teaching lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering (Dukkha), its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."
