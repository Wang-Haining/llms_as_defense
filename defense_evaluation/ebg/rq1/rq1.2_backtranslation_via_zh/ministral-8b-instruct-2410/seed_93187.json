            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the field of social work, I plan to work in the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. The core values that I can bring to the social work field include: service, respect, integrity, commitment to improving relationships between others, and striving to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not only important for social workers; they are personally important.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of my career path. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many people fleeing from their problems in denial, and some used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents' residence. To see if I could assist in any way, I drove over to their house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to talk to the parents since there was nothing they could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they appeared nervous and used excuses to describe their son's “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this incident, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children resolve “simple” disputes within their families.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have passed away. The concept of the \"individual\" that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be like others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, and so on. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep issues. The Sociocultural model explores environmental influences and their relation to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia investigates these models and explains the chosen research to better understand them. It evaluates the research's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia refers to difficulties in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by difficulties staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review concentrates on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects of sleep. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep, negatively impacting school, career, and daily activities involving focus and monotony.",
            "This paper discusses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It first provides a brief definition of the disorder. Next, it explains the diagnosis, including common characteristics or \"red flags\". Finally, it suggests ways for teachers in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. This means that people with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty processing what they hear, particularly in separating words from background noise or understanding changes in speech.\n\nThe term \"CAPD\" was first mentioned in the mid-1950s, originally called \"auditory imperception\". The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 stimulated further research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech, blocking sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. There is no single test or known cause for the disorder, and it often involves differentiating multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli or recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be useful in perpetuating long-term deception, ultimately one must reject that newfound guise or risk losing oneself forever in the process. Ending a deception, however, can lead to alienation, forcing one to choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many sub-issues, with the most significant one being: why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clearly a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, disconnecting her from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must navigate suppressed romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this may reflect a progressive attitude, modern readers might see Twelfth Night as an illustration of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be a parody of people from his time who judge others solely based on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's ease in switching her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and in her beginning to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa, has been noted by various observers. Obviously, a comprehensive description of an entire colonial empire cannot be reduced to such a simple depiction. The German colonial empire, like its geography, exhibited diverse policies and styles of governance. Educational provisions across the colonies were also diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also lauded by contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, in Southwest Africa, the responsibility for educating natives was almost entirely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest significantly in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on Southwest Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in Southwest Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experiences of Southwest Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing particularly on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in Southwest Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in Southwest Africa accounts for many of the distinguishing features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, Southwest Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although a large portion of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of Southwest Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in Southwest Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of pop music has expanded over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. The situation is complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. It is often said that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side. It is diverse in that almost immediately after the genre's beginnings, people realized its flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genres, which then led to sub-sub-genres, and this chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal scene where there are so many niches and sub-genres that it is hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate themes from various other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand what the metal movement is and why it is a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be considered as \"more\" music—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill; metal musicians really know how to play their instruments, and it is evident in their music. Metal is also, and this may not be surprising, a movement heavily influenced by drug use. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-'70s that led to people becoming increasingly erratic, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for inspiration. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene as a significant amount of popular music lacked qualities that truly tapped into the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark and visceral qualities that were so prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is so integral to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exhibit the darker side of the band. Its ups and downs are said to represent the effects of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they included this song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike works, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits in a dream but also Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Since he started his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this ambition. The Dream is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting to gain acceptance from the critical art world he admired, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this lens, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level, there is a profound reason for this. As John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase similar to, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent that is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this ‘something’, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful country, a united nation with its own unique cultural heritage, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the central part of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe River. With such a unique culture, it's not surprising that Germany as we know it today is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is still debated by scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and battled Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine. He adopted this term from the Gauls to distinguish between those he had conquered and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it refers to a neighbor in the Gaulish language, or perhaps the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy (O.E.D., 2010).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I would regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not a mix of other races through immigration or contact. For, in ancient times, those who sought to emigrate would do so by sea... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy to go to Germany, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, sullen manners, and cheerless appearance, unless it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania to trade goods and lead land campaigns, but they would mostly return to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. Without emotion, silently, and with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to connect the object of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts flickered into my mind and quickly disappeared, so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture the artist wishes to study with a square, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into a simple one. At the time, staring at a bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, this was the beginning of my work, the start of my story. Work in Brown. My fingertips touched my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop in hand, feet spread a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet, introspective moments to myself, then my hand reached for the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\nBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures. The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation. It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out. If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.) Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation.\nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "In browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Generally, the trick film at the turn of the century is stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most notable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism. Although he was primarily an agriculturalist, his profession and brief career in politics made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for nearly all of his opinions concerning the government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, allowing for the establishment of a system of self-government. He believed strongly in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is man's motivation in all things, but that the trait is only considered evil when it leads beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that live at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sudden decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening. The exact reason for this is unclear. With the onset of winter in a New England campus, fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot, which might account for part of the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester when students are busy with final exams and grading, causing them to overlook submitting the commuter log. Furthermore, December also brings the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low number of logs for that month. However, this does not explain the low number of submissions in February. One might speculate that any project like this may experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to boost log submissions, which indeed resulted in an increase for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite both the natural decrease in engagement and the winter break. Another challenge in promoting alternative commuting projects is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars in society. Therefore, offering incentives is crucial. We offered gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have further increased participation. Increasing the value of the prizes over time might also have helped. While the gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement instead of decreasing it.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of index funds and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are very attractive, but the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, similar to buying a stock. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. While these benefits are clear, it's beneficial for savvy financial investors to evaluate whether these benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent. For this effort, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal risk-return ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, it would be impractical to include every holding, so we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land”, Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term, but there is a more contemporary source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book “Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon”, comments on the similarity between their two poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her death, he begins drinking heavily and crying for his departed queen. He then decides it is time for him to die and gives his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are quite similar, perhaps a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year before Poe’s use of the term “Thule” in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, he references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land”, the speaker describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be interpreted as a reflection of Goethe’s poem, as Goethe’s king has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author who Poe would have known, aside from his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson: “Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.”",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that punitive damages are justified, the plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer's accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive, it is still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010).

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is more relevant than ever today. Looking back at events since 9/11, I've personally observed a shift in American mainstream media's view of Islam and extremism from hostility to extreme tolerance. I don't think in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who had an obvious Muslim background in his family.\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts his personality. From what I know and have learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad was depicted as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which, people started to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious example is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\nThere are also many stories in the biography that seem to be part of their agenda to provide proof of 'witness' or how people 'spontaneously' converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, the author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard them from so-and-so, and so on. I didn't like this much because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\nI think what bothers me the most about this work is that they try to exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but think that if Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, they would react differently.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle demonstrates how people are fundamentally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and strive to make their lives as good as possible, without considering anyone below them. The novel shows this in several ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the large factories. All they care about is making their companies and factories as big and prosperous as possible. They do not care about anything or anyone that gets in their way or is harmed due to their advancement. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to depict the immense damage caused by this pollution. He shows that the owners have no concern for any person or animal that might be hurt. They do not care about the massive plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal waste and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also do not care about their employees working to make them wealthy. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then, without any notice, might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes these methods extensively in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/ gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he establishes meanings for white/gray and red/pink colors and uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with significant objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white signifying elegance and white/grey representing a higher social status, and gray indicating age and fading. He introduces this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone wears white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick gets his first impression of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by using them to color mundane subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), people at Gatsby's parties are listed under \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28)—symbolizing uniformity. He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"valley of ashes\" features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is an \"old gray man\" (27).\n\nAfter imbuing white/gray with sufficient meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her being a uniform addition, such as describing a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her being in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is known for its agricultural productivity, mainly due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a thriving market for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic products. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, encouraging recreational use, and providing opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical use. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming in some aspects. It requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil naturally. Organic farms often experience higher losses compared to conventional methods, and may lack the economies of scale seen in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops or removing invasive species, can also increase labor costs. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel for this scenario is located in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. The land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review, but it currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThe area has a long history of human habitation, with Native Americans living there for centuries. Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. A real estate website was used to find this piece of property, and available government programs were researched to understand cost-saving and wildlife-friendly operational options for a small farmer. A local organic farm in the same area served as a model for what might be achieved.",
            "Culture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it actually is and what it represents. Culture is not homogeneous, nor is it a specific thing; it is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture’s generalizations is appropriate, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitudes can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to their own culture, and comparisons naturally arise. Attempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward. It is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. Values are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is also found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. It is believed by the other author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas, who also argues for the existence of God. Given that each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, our task is to determine which argument is better. To simplify, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. To compare their arguments, we must assume the same type of God figure. Neither argument, however, provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage shows a path to understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot fully conceive of His non-existence. While his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that proof of God lies within our own minds. He suggests that truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is not needed. This is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence without the need for faith. This approach could aid in Christian evangelism by converting new believers through logical reasoning without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments supporting the existence of God, including arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. If you know you are missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, logic dictates you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Some time during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and attained enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. The religion is now around 2,500 years old; it looks different today than when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it has religious significance, although Buddha never taught about such a festival. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the core beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\nThere are several terms that will be frequently used in this discussion. The concepts of internal versus external forces will be mentioned. Here, internal forces refer to influences from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that do not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community but may do so accidentally. These terms will reappear throughout this discussion.\nFirst, it is crucial to examine the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka holds the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By understanding these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Along with Sansara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life, with laypeople having five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, no sexual misconduct, and not taking intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are a case of two nations that once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were many other conflicts between the two nations, which subsided just before World War I. The rivalry began with Americans and Mexicans clashing over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, and had a major conflict of material interests. This is not uncommon among nations that share a border, which often leads to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have enjoyed good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a schism between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which included ideological struggles and competitions over vital interests, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was primarily based on religious preferences. This distrust originated from the animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to dissipate as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended as \"American ambitions changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession from a deep-seated need for safety and security that I had lacked as a child. The mantra I heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am at 46 years old, single, with no financial cushion and unable to work. I've been disabled for 15 years, living on Social Security Disability and have nothing left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know one thing for sure: I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. When disaster strikes, you feel anything but strong.\n\nThe point is that emergencies, big and small, will always be a part of life. There are no guarantees, and no matter how prepared we are, some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely solely on big government; its system is flawed. However, I'd rather see Americans trusting and supporting each other again, learning to help one another and ask for help, rather than everyone fending for themselves in their own backyards.\n\nConservatives often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our country, but the truth is, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that kept our forefathers going. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the resources for a small farm, can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the improvements in child and maternal health rates fall far short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focus on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, leading to a high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Therefore, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this area is also a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expected levels, at around 4%. These rates also highlight another significant issue: while the rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas, indicating a problem with healthcare service equity. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas. Another access-related issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This suggests that the poor find it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to address the above-listed problems are appealing. Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target specific health sectors have clear, manageable objectives, but they also generally yield faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in programs for specific health areas can lead to other areas suffering from lack of funding and human resources being drawn to the better-funded sectors (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplicated services that are also uncoordinated, leading to increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of that era. Two novels that deviate from this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these novels incorporate an element of mystery and a penchant for the unconventional, which is atypical of the period. This strengthens the characters and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, clouds of bewildering and confusing ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention on himself, … he realized that he was talking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos reigned as some unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and function varying in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences frequently reveal some insight into Oliver’s inner self, the things that pained him, and his awareness of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage underscores Oliver’s lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state his health had reached. This is strongly present through Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelmed him; all his senses were numbed, and he did not notice the “unseen hand” that bore him away; he experienced his despair again, removed from the shock of pain, as the pain was now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver had little control over anything; he could not even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life was in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied here, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The days passed – day! There was no day; it came and went as quickly as the night, which seemed so long and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting moments.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program tutoring elementary age students. I tried to help them with whatever subjects they were struggling in, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was having a lot of trouble reading. I realized something was wrong; he had the most unusual problems. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't even get close to. He was of Latino descent, and I knew he spoke perfect English, but his reading issues seemed perplexing. We struggled, and it wasn't until I met his mother that I understood the problem. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. With my limited knowledge of Spanish, we managed to communicate. It was then that it dawned on me: Adrian could read fine; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to address the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It also serves to illustrate that the problem isn't always as apparent as we might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading it can still be a significant obstacle. We all agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively simple: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all of these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most children will not benefit. This is false. If we implemented these programs in the classroom as the rule, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and unrealistic. However, I do believe we can have special aides, tutors, or whatever they are called, who are bilingual.",
            "From the moment we are children, we are often told that there is something larger than ourselves and our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within ourselves. Many of us readily accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them, believing nothing exists beyond our personal perspective. We may switch from one set of values to another. Regardless of our path, we strive to define part of ourselves through our unique spiritual outlooks. We search for light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite birds. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof above as we shared cigarettes. The rainwater gushed through the gutters, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a mix of searching and reminiscing. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner and sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, deliberately avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate my father's suffering, but extended his life a few more months than the doctors had predicted; I struggled to find value in that. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to witness my father's transition from life to death. So, I did not. I could not watch the life that brought me into this world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else, better than his family, and I knew he would not want me to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, in both name and essence, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and disparaged, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' aspect. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary method. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic techniques to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition elements. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new novel format, allowing for a more personal exploration of character psychology, has kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers centuries removed from its original publication.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers due to the ideal of the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's eventual evolution into Romanticism and serving as a means to aspire to improve the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a period of political turmoil and despairing over the future. Immersed in politics and facing unfair accusations, he may have felt that the morality and innate goodness of the Gothic era had diminished in modern society. This is evident in several characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader recognizes chivalric traits in his description:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many traditional chivalric images; he is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the flow of processes moving goods from the customer order to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six key elements to provide the best customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are. Once managers have analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind customer demand and satisfaction must be met. After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process. Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a designed layout for every entity of the business, from how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipments from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product. All divisions consist of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is the best fit for the different processes of the product. Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nElliot Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, several street protests took place, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the government reluctantly allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but violence soon escalated to what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested on sight, including Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist who was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, quoted, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities happening in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive power over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be actual gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and seppuku, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports released by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich' was a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems mainly from his longevity and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his presence on the piano is often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex works that highlight the individual skills of his band members. He designed a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated phrases and arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his band members and emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra. This enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, particularly in the piece “Creole Love Call,” which uses the voice as a jazz instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. “Creole Love Call” also demonstrates his ability to complement the style of his soloists, which is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n1. Call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\n2. Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several blue notes.\n3. Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. Full-band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus where reeds take the lead in a call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice adopting the “growl” technique.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a tone color dimension to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nLater, in “Hot and Bothered,” recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal aspects of Miley’s playing and the instrumental elements of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” extends these ideas, with Ellington utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she had felt a persistent longing for something intangible. This unfulfilled desire had begun around the age of 14 and remained with her even at 17. She had come to realize she desired a person rather than a material thing, yet no boy had sparked her interest. Despite several attempts by others, she remained uninterested. She often questioned her own nature, wondering what could cause this peculiar situation in a young girl. Years of introspection had yielded no satisfactory answers, so she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nGenerally, days at home were peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm, rarely arguing, even with their daughter. The only conflict arose when she asserted her independence and lively personality. She was the daughter of a peaceful couple, but her exuberance made her easily liked, along with her innate niceness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she moved from room to room, seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, groaning in pain. She knelt beside her, \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother, struggling to speak through the pain, asked her daughter to take her to the hospital. The daughter, grateful for her physical strength, carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused solely on her mother. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her to be examined. Her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as lower stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial showed it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated through several studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, “probable” cases were included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse the results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hormones, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America’s most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must consider: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In brief, the financial crisis was brought about by selfish and naive political decisions that forced banks and companies to issue subprime loans into an immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks faced a shortage of capital reserves and passed this chaos on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the president sought reelection. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest home mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes later warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the introduction details, and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to excessive leverage by U.S. households and financial markets in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to even small price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were left with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That is the part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and take flight, leaving everyone amazed with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in a fun way.\n\nExposition is no friend of yours.\n\nMy dear readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still gets stuck in long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to tell your audience every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple language. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a long monologue of information, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. While reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, that they were married in a grand fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire episode to take two pages, during which both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would expect the heroine to demonstrate through big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later tells you straight out that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked like pure evil. Only two minutes were devoted to this story as it was still developing. They only provided that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. There had been no arrests at the time or any suspects. The SWAT team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe it might have been due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often glossed over when they are victims of a crime. For instance, if a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes crazy; but if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location. It was determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of the story was a bit short, but they used it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was about six feet tall, and weighed about 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and the darkness of his skin.\n\nAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure what the angle was, whether they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "Brothers share an unbreakable bond, an unassailable connection. This bond is filled with emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other more deeply than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they often see a reflection of themselves. It is in dire situations that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether it is for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they often come with great cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal bond is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look into their brother's eyes and see oneself, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions that surround it. In a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his younger brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He wanted a brother he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could be someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn… These things were obviously impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he would even survive. Even if he did, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. For the young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, this was a devastating blow. He even began to contemplate killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think of infanticide? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist so much hope! This shows that his conviction probably wasn't very strong. Deep down, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that while these metaphors are helpful, they can also lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object edges to recognize a box. Top-down processing uses these decisions to speed up identifying the box as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes to make available. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with specific methods for each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the printed word looks), phonemically (how the word sounds), or semantically (what the word means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are nodes, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the emerging threat of both technology and the capitalist system in his novel Brave New World. The society values collective happiness above individuality and conditions its citizens from birth to pursue pleasure above all else. Citizens are mere tools in the scheme of the World Controller, who imposes a single ideology. Through the lens of Marxist philosophy, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel critiques the flaws of the emerging economy of its time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relationships. This is achieved through ideological control of the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no genuine will of their own; their desire to consume and indulge is strengthened by hypnopædia, controlled by the World Controller. This manipulation is an example of hegemony, where a dominant group controls the lower classes, who unknowingly support this structure. The upper classes are aware of this manipulation but do not act. Few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, do more than accept their place. The interactions between social classes reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there is no genuine relationship between individuals. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism takes away people's free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial, as seen in men's comments about women's physical appearance and women's comments about their sexual encounters. Each class's complacency with its status in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their role in the community is evidence of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are made to feel superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I have studied at University Park for about two and a half years, or approximately four and a half semesters. For many people, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dormitory, which was the easternmost residence hall on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, as it often is in State College. An alumni slightly older than me mentioned that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traveling from one location to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility on a college campus? The bicycle is often the best option. However, having a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure should accommodate bicyclists.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had resumed bicycling after a few years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the only practical way to get around.” In addition to being beneficial for your health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as certain dorms. This year, the smartest decision I made was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is at least a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it isn't always an easy path to traverse by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on would consume more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models.

The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the field of social work, I plan to work in the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. The core values that I can bring to the social work field include: service, respect, integrity, commitment to improving relationships between others, and striving to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not only important for social workers; they are personally important.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of my career path. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many people fleeing from their problems in denial, and some used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents' residence. To see if I could assist in any way, I drove over to their house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to talk to the parents since there was nothing they could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they appeared nervous and used excuses to describe their son's “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this incident, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children resolve “simple” disputes within their families.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have passed away. The concept of the \"individual\" that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be like others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, and so on. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",

This review of insomnia investigates these models and explains the chosen research to better understand them. It evaluates the research's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia refers to difficulties in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by difficulties staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review concentrates on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects of sleep. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep, negatively impacting school, career, and daily activities involving focus and monotony.",
            "This paper discusses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It first provides a brief definition of the disorder. Next, it explains the diagnosis, including common characteristics or \"red flags\". Finally, it suggests ways for teachers in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. This means that people with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty processing what they hear, particularly in separating words from background noise or understanding changes in speech.\n\nThe term \"CAPD\" was first mentioned in the mid-1950s, originally called \"auditory imperception\". The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 stimulated further research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech, blocking sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. There is no single test or known cause for the disorder, and it often involves differentiating multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli or recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be useful in perpetuating long-term deception, ultimately one must reject that newfound guise or risk losing oneself forever in the process. Ending a deception, however, can lead to alienation, forcing one to choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many sub-issues, with the most significant one being: why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clearly a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, disconnecting her from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must navigate suppressed romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this may reflect a progressive attitude, modern readers might see Twelfth Night as an illustration of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be a parody of people from his time who judge others solely based on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's ease in switching her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and in her beginning to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa, has been noted by various observers. Obviously, a comprehensive description of an entire colonial empire cannot be reduced to such a simple depiction. The German colonial empire, like its geography, exhibited diverse policies and styles of governance. Educational provisions across the colonies were also diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also lauded by contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, in Southwest Africa, the responsibility for educating natives was almost entirely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest significantly in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on Southwest Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in Southwest Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experiences of Southwest Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing particularly on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in Southwest Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in Southwest Africa accounts for many of the distinguishing features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, Southwest Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although a large portion of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of Southwest Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in Southwest Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of pop music has expanded over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. The situation is complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. It is often said that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side. It is diverse in that almost immediately after the genre's beginnings, people realized its flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genres, which then led to sub-sub-genres, and this chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal scene where there are so many niches and sub-genres that it is hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate themes from various other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand what the metal movement is and why it is a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be considered as \"more\" music—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill; metal musicians really know how to play their instruments, and it is evident in their music. Metal is also, and this may not be surprising, a movement heavily influenced by drug use. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-'70s that led to people becoming increasingly erratic, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for inspiration. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene as a significant amount of popular music lacked qualities that truly tapped into the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark and visceral qualities that were so prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is so integral to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exhibit the darker side of the band. Its ups and downs are said to represent the effects of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they included this song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike works, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits in a dream but also Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Since he started his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this ambition. The Dream is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting to gain acceptance from the critical art world he admired, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this lens, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level, there is a profound reason for this. As John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase similar to, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent that is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this ‘something’, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful country, a united nation with its own unique cultural heritage, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the central part of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe River. With such a unique culture, it's not surprising that Germany as we know it today is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is still debated by scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and battled Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine. He adopted this term from the Gauls to distinguish between those he had conquered and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it refers to a neighbor in the Gaulish language, or perhaps the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy (O.E.D., 2010).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I would regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not a mix of other races through immigration or contact. For, in ancient times, those who sought to emigrate would do so by sea... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy to go to Germany, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, sullen manners, and cheerless appearance, unless it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania to trade goods and lead land campaigns, but they would mostly return to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. Without emotion, silently, and with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to connect the object of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts flickered into my mind and quickly disappeared, so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture the artist wishes to study with a square, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into a simple one. At the time, staring at a bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, this was the beginning of my work, the start of my story. Work in Brown. My fingertips touched my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop in hand, feet spread a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet, introspective moments to myself, then my hand reached for the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\nBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures. The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation. It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out. If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.) Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation.\nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "In browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Generally, the trick film at the turn of the century is stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most notable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism. Although he was primarily an agriculturalist, his profession and brief career in politics made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for nearly all of his opinions concerning the government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, allowing for the establishment of a system of self-government. He believed strongly in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is man's motivation in all things, but that the trait is only considered evil when it leads beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that live at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sudden decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening. The exact reason for this is unclear. With the onset of winter in a New England campus, fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot, which might account for part of the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester when students are busy with final exams and grading, causing them to overlook submitting the commuter log. Furthermore, December also brings the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low number of logs for that month. However, this does not explain the low number of submissions in February. One might speculate that any project like this may experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to boost log submissions, which indeed resulted in an increase for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite both the natural decrease in engagement and the winter break. Another challenge in promoting alternative commuting projects is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars in society. Therefore, offering incentives is crucial. We offered gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have further increased participation. Increasing the value of the prizes over time might also have helped. While the gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement instead of decreasing it.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of index funds and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are very attractive, but the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, similar to buying a stock. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. While these benefits are clear, it's beneficial for savvy financial investors to evaluate whether these benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent. For this effort, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal risk-return ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, it would be impractical to include every holding, so we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land”, Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term, but there is a more contemporary source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book “Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon”, comments on the similarity between their two poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her death, he begins drinking heavily and crying for his departed queen. He then decides it is time for him to die and gives his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are quite similar, perhaps a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year before Poe’s use of the term “Thule” in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, he references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land”, the speaker describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be interpreted as a reflection of Goethe’s poem, as Goethe’s king has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author who Poe would have known, aside from his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson: “Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.”",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that punitive damages are justified, the plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer's accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive, it is still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is more relevant than ever today. Looking back at events since 9/11, I've personally observed a shift in American mainstream media's view of Islam and extremism from hostility to extreme tolerance. I don't think in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who had an obvious Muslim background in his family.\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts his personality. From what I know and have learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad was depicted as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which, people started to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious example is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\nThere are also many stories in the biography that seem to be part of their agenda to provide proof of 'witness' or how people 'spontaneously' converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, the author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard them from so-and-so, and so on. I didn't like this much because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\nI think what bothers me the most about this work is that they try to exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but think that if Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, they would react differently.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle demonstrates how people are fundamentally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and strive to make their lives as good as possible, without considering anyone below them. The novel shows this in several ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the large factories. All they care about is making their companies and factories as big and prosperous as possible. They do not care about anything or anyone that gets in their way or is harmed due to their advancement. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to depict the immense damage caused by this pollution. He shows that the owners have no concern for any person or animal that might be hurt. They do not care about the massive plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal waste and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also do not care about their employees working to make them wealthy. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then, without any notice, might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes these methods extensively in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/ gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he establishes meanings for white/gray and red/pink colors and uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with significant objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white signifying elegance and white/grey representing a higher social status, and gray indicating age and fading. He introduces this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone wears white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick gets his first impression of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by using them to color mundane subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), people at Gatsby's parties are listed under \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28)—symbolizing uniformity. He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"valley of ashes\" features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is an \"old gray man\" (27).\n\nAfter imbuing white/gray with sufficient meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her being a uniform addition, such as describing a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her being in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is known for its agricultural productivity, mainly due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a thriving market for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic products. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, encouraging recreational use, and providing opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical use. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming in some aspects. It requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil naturally. Organic farms often experience higher losses compared to conventional methods, and may lack the economies of scale seen in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops or removing invasive species, can also increase labor costs. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel for this scenario is located in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. The land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review, but it currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThe area has a long history of human habitation, with Native Americans living there for centuries. Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. A real estate website was used to find this piece of property, and available government programs were researched to understand cost-saving and wildlife-friendly operational options for a small farmer. A local organic farm in the same area served as a model for what might be achieved.",
            "Culture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it actually is and what it represents. Culture is not homogeneous, nor is it a specific thing; it is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture’s generalizations is appropriate, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitudes can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to their own culture, and comparisons naturally arise. Attempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward. It is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. Values are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is also found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. It is believed by the other author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas, who also argues for the existence of God. Given that each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, our task is to determine which argument is better. To simplify, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. To compare their arguments, we must assume the same type of God figure. Neither argument, however, provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage shows a path to understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot fully conceive of His non-existence. While his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that proof of God lies within our own minds. He suggests that truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is not needed. This is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence without the need for faith. This approach could aid in Christian evangelism by converting new believers through logical reasoning without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments supporting the existence of God, including arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. If you know you are missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, logic dictates you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Some time during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and attained enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. The religion is now around 2,500 years old; it looks different today than when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it has religious significance, although Buddha never taught about such a festival. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the core beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\nThere are several terms that will be frequently used in this discussion. The concepts of internal versus external forces will be mentioned. Here, internal forces refer to influences from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that do not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community but may do so accidentally. These terms will reappear throughout this discussion.\nFirst, it is crucial to examine the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka holds the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By understanding these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Along with Sansara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life, with laypeople having five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, no sexual misconduct, and not taking intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are a case of two nations that once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were many other conflicts between the two nations, which subsided just before World War I. The rivalry began with Americans and Mexicans clashing over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, and had a major conflict of material interests. This is not uncommon among nations that share a border, which often leads to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have enjoyed good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a schism between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which included ideological struggles and competitions over vital interests, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was primarily based on religious preferences. This distrust originated from the animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to dissipate as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended as \"American ambitions changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession from a deep-seated need for safety and security that I had lacked as a child. The mantra I heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am at 46 years old, single, with no financial cushion and unable to work. I've been disabled for 15 years, living on Social Security Disability and have nothing left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know one thing for sure: I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. When disaster strikes, you feel anything but strong.\n\nThe point is that emergencies, big and small, will always be a part of life. There are no guarantees, and no matter how prepared we are, some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely solely on big government; its system is flawed. However, I'd rather see Americans trusting and supporting each other again, learning to help one another and ask for help, rather than everyone fending for themselves in their own backyards.\n\nConservatives often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our country, but the truth is, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that kept our forefathers going. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the resources for a small farm, can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the improvements in child and maternal health rates fall far short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focus on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, leading to a high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Therefore, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this area is also a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expected levels, at around 4%. These rates also highlight another significant issue: while the rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas, indicating a problem with healthcare service equity. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas. Another access-related issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This suggests that the poor find it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to address the above-listed problems are appealing. Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target specific health sectors have clear, manageable objectives, but they also generally yield faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in programs for specific health areas can lead to other areas suffering from lack of funding and human resources being drawn to the better-funded sectors (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplicated services that are also uncoordinated, leading to increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of that era. Two novels that deviate from this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these novels incorporate an element of mystery and a penchant for the unconventional, which is atypical of the period. This strengthens the characters and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, clouds of bewildering and confusing ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention on himself, … he realized that he was talking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos reigned as some unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and function varying in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences frequently reveal some insight into Oliver’s inner self, the things that pained him, and his awareness of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage underscores Oliver’s lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state his health had reached. This is strongly present through Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelmed him; all his senses were numbed, and he did not notice the “unseen hand” that bore him away; he experienced his despair again, removed from the shock of pain, as the pain was now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver had little control over anything; he could not even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life was in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied here, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The days passed – day! There was no day; it came and went as quickly as the night, which seemed so long and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting moments.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program tutoring elementary age students. I tried to help them with whatever subjects they were struggling in, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was having a lot of trouble reading. I realized something was wrong; he had the most unusual problems. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't even get close to. He was of Latino descent, and I knew he spoke perfect English, but his reading issues seemed perplexing. We struggled, and it wasn't until I met his mother that I understood the problem. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. With my limited knowledge of Spanish, we managed to communicate. It was then that it dawned on me: Adrian could read fine; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to address the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It also serves to illustrate that the problem isn't always as apparent as we might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading it can still be a significant obstacle. We all agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively simple: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all of these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most children will not benefit. This is false. If we implemented these programs in the classroom as the rule, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and unrealistic. However, I do believe we can have special aides, tutors, or whatever they are called, who are bilingual.",
            "From the moment we are children, we are often told that there is something larger than ourselves and our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within ourselves. Many of us readily accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them, believing nothing exists beyond our personal perspective. We may switch from one set of values to another. Regardless of our path, we strive to define part of ourselves through our unique spiritual outlooks. We search for light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite birds. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof above as we shared cigarettes. The rainwater gushed through the gutters, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a mix of searching and reminiscing. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner and sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, deliberately avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate my father's suffering, but extended his life a few more months than the doctors had predicted; I struggled to find value in that. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to witness my father's transition from life to death. So, I did not. I could not watch the life that brought me into this world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else, better than his family, and I knew he would not want me to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, in both name and essence, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and disparaged, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' aspect. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary method. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic techniques to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition elements. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new novel format, allowing for a more personal exploration of character psychology, has kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers centuries removed from its original publication.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers due to the ideal of the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's eventual evolution into Romanticism and serving as a means to aspire to improve the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a period of political turmoil and despairing over the future. Immersed in politics and facing unfair accusations, he may have felt that the morality and innate goodness of the Gothic era had diminished in modern society. This is evident in several characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader recognizes chivalric traits in his description:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many traditional chivalric images; he is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the flow of processes moving goods from the customer order to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six key elements to provide the best customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are. Once managers have analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind customer demand and satisfaction must be met. After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process. Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a designed layout for every entity of the business, from how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipments from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product. All divisions consist of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is the best fit for the different processes of the product. Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nElliot Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, several street protests took place, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the government reluctantly allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but violence soon escalated to what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested on sight, including Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist who was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, quoted, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities happening in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive power over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be actual gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and seppuku, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports released by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich' was a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems mainly from his longevity and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his presence on the piano is often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex works that highlight the individual skills of his band members. He designed a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated phrases and arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his band members and emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra. This enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, particularly in the piece “Creole Love Call,” which uses the voice as a jazz instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. “Creole Love Call” also demonstrates his ability to complement the style of his soloists, which is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n1. Call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\n2. Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several blue notes.\n3. Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. Full-band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus where reeds take the lead in a call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice adopting the “growl” technique.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a tone color dimension to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nLater, in “Hot and Bothered,” recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal aspects of Miley’s playing and the instrumental elements of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” extends these ideas, with Ellington utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she had felt a persistent longing for something intangible. This unfulfilled desire had begun around the age of 14 and remained with her even at 17. She had come to realize she desired a person rather than a material thing, yet no boy had sparked her interest. Despite several attempts by others, she remained uninterested. She often questioned her own nature, wondering what could cause this peculiar situation in a young girl. Years of introspection had yielded no satisfactory answers, so she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nGenerally, days at home were peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm, rarely arguing, even with their daughter. The only conflict arose when she asserted her independence and lively personality. She was the daughter of a peaceful couple, but her exuberance made her easily liked, along with her innate niceness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she moved from room to room, seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, groaning in pain. She knelt beside her, \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother, struggling to speak through the pain, asked her daughter to take her to the hospital. The daughter, grateful for her physical strength, carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused solely on her mother. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her to be examined. Her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as lower stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial showed it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated through several studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, “probable” cases were included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse the results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hormones, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America’s most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must consider: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In brief, the financial crisis was brought about by selfish and naive political decisions that forced banks and companies to issue subprime loans into an immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks faced a shortage of capital reserves and passed this chaos on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the president sought reelection. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest home mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes later warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the introduction details, and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to excessive leverage by U.S. households and financial markets in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to even small price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were left with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That is the part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and take flight, leaving everyone amazed with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in a fun way.\n\nExposition is no friend of yours.\n\nMy dear readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still gets stuck in long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to tell your audience every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple language. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a long monologue of information, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. While reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, that they were married in a grand fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire episode to take two pages, during which both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would expect the heroine to demonstrate through big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later tells you straight out that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked like pure evil. Only two minutes were devoted to this story as it was still developing. They only provided that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. There had been no arrests at the time or any suspects. The SWAT team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe it might have been due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often glossed over when they are victims of a crime. For instance, if a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes crazy; but if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location. It was determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of the story was a bit short, but they used it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was about six feet tall, and weighed about 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and the darkness of his skin.\n\nAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure what the angle was, whether they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "Brothers share an unbreakable bond, an unassailable connection. This bond is filled with emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other more deeply than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they often see a reflection of themselves. It is in dire situations that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether it is for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they often come with great cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal bond is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look into their brother's eyes and see oneself, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions that surround it. In a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his younger brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He wanted a brother he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could be someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn… These things were obviously impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he would even survive. Even if he did, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. For the young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, this was a devastating blow. He even began to contemplate killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think of infanticide? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist so much hope! This shows that his conviction probably wasn't very strong. Deep down, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that while these metaphors are helpful, they can also lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object edges to recognize a box. Top-down processing uses these decisions to speed up identifying the box as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes to make available. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with specific methods for each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the printed word looks), phonemically (how the word sounds), or semantically (what the word means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are nodes, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the emerging threat of both technology and the capitalist system in his novel Brave New World. The society values collective happiness above individuality and conditions its citizens from birth to pursue pleasure above all else. Citizens are mere tools in the scheme of the World Controller, who imposes a single ideology. Through the lens of Marxist philosophy, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel critiques the flaws of the emerging economy of its time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relationships. This is achieved through ideological control of the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no genuine will of their own; their desire to consume and indulge is strengthened by hypnopædia, controlled by the World Controller. This manipulation is an example of hegemony, where a dominant group controls the lower classes, who unknowingly support this structure. The upper classes are aware of this manipulation but do not act. Few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, do more than accept their place. The interactions between social classes reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there is no genuine relationship between individuals. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism takes away people's free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial, as seen in men's comments about women's physical appearance and women's comments about their sexual encounters. Each class's complacency with its status in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their role in the community is evidence of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are made to feel superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I have studied at University Park for about two and a half years, or approximately four and a half semesters. For many people, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dormitory, which was the easternmost residence hall on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, as it often is in State College. An alumni slightly older than me mentioned that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traveling from one location to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility on a college campus? The bicycle is often the best option. However, having a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure should accommodate bicyclists.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had resumed bicycling after a few years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the only practical way to get around.” In addition to being beneficial for your health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as certain dorms. This year, the smartest decision I made was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is at least a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it isn't always an easy path to traverse by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on would consume more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the field of social work, I plan to work in the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. The core values that I can bring to the social work field include: service, respect, integrity, commitment to improving relationships between others, and striving to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not only important for social workers; they are personally important.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of my career path. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many people fleeing from their problems in denial, and some used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents' residence. To see if I could assist in any way, I drove over to their house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to talk to the parents since there was nothing they could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they appeared nervous and used excuses to describe their son's “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this incident, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children resolve “simple” disputes within their families.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have passed away. The concept of the \"individual\" that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be like others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, and so on. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep issues. The Sociocultural model explores environmental influences and their relation to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia investigates these models and explains the chosen research to better understand them. It evaluates the research's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia refers to difficulties in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by difficulties staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review concentrates on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects of sleep. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep, negatively impacting school, career, and daily activities involving focus and monotony.",
            "This paper discusses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It first provides a brief definition of the disorder. Next, it explains the diagnosis, including common characteristics or \"red flags\". Finally, it suggests ways for teachers in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. This means that people with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty processing what they hear, particularly in separating words from background noise or understanding changes in speech.\n\nThe term \"CAPD\" was first mentioned in the mid-1950s, originally called \"auditory imperception\". The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 stimulated further research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech, blocking sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. There is no single test or known cause for the disorder, and it often involves differentiating multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli or recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be useful in perpetuating long-term deception, ultimately one must reject that newfound guise or risk losing oneself forever in the process. Ending a deception, however, can lead to alienation, forcing one to choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many sub-issues, with the most significant one being: why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clearly a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, disconnecting her from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must navigate suppressed romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this may reflect a progressive attitude, modern readers might see Twelfth Night as an illustration of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be a parody of people from his time who judge others solely based on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's ease in switching her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and in her beginning to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa, has been noted by various observers. Obviously, a comprehensive description of an entire colonial empire cannot be reduced to such a simple depiction. The German colonial empire, like its geography, exhibited diverse policies and styles of governance. Educational provisions across the colonies were also diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also lauded by contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, in Southwest Africa, the responsibility for educating natives was almost entirely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest significantly in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on Southwest Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in Southwest Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experiences of Southwest Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing particularly on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in Southwest Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in Southwest Africa accounts for many of the distinguishing features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, Southwest Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although a large portion of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of Southwest Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in Southwest Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of pop music has expanded over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. The situation is complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. It is often said that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side. It is diverse in that almost immediately after the genre's beginnings, people realized its flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genres, which then led to sub-sub-genres, and this chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal scene where there are so many niches and sub-genres that it is hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate themes from various other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand what the metal movement is and why it is a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be considered as \"more\" music—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill; metal musicians really know how to play their instruments, and it is evident in their music. Metal is also, and this may not be surprising, a movement heavily influenced by drug use. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-'70s that led to people becoming increasingly erratic, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for inspiration. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene as a significant amount of popular music lacked qualities that truly tapped into the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark and visceral qualities that were so prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is so integral to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exhibit the darker side of the band. Its ups and downs are said to represent the effects of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they included this song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike works, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits in a dream but also Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Since he started his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this ambition. The Dream is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting to gain acceptance from the critical art world he admired, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this lens, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level, there is a profound reason for this. As John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase similar to, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent that is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this ‘something’, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful country, a united nation with its own unique cultural heritage, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the central part of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe River. With such a unique culture, it's not surprising that Germany as we know it today is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is still debated by scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and battled Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine. He adopted this term from the Gauls to distinguish between those he had conquered and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it refers to a neighbor in the Gaulish language, or perhaps the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy (O.E.D., 2010).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I would regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not a mix of other races through immigration or contact. For, in ancient times, those who sought to emigrate would do so by sea... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy to go to Germany, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, sullen manners, and cheerless appearance, unless it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania to trade goods and lead land campaigns, but they would mostly return to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. Without emotion, silently, and with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to connect the object of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts flickered into my mind and quickly disappeared, so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture the artist wishes to study with a square, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into a simple one. At the time, staring at a bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, this was the beginning of my work, the start of my story. Work in Brown. My fingertips touched my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop in hand, feet spread a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet, introspective moments to myself, then my hand reached for the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\nBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures. The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation. It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out. If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.) Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation.\nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "In browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Generally, the trick film at the turn of the century is stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most notable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism. Although he was primarily an agriculturalist, his profession and brief career in politics made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for nearly all of his opinions concerning the government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, allowing for the establishment of a system of self-government. He believed strongly in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is man's motivation in all things, but that the trait is only considered evil when it leads beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that live at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sudden decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening. The exact reason for this is unclear. With the onset of winter in a New England campus, fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot, which might account for part of the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester when students are busy with final exams and grading, causing them to overlook submitting the commuter log. Furthermore, December also brings the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low number of logs for that month. However, this does not explain the low number of submissions in February. One might speculate that any project like this may experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to boost log submissions, which indeed resulted in an increase for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite both the natural decrease in engagement and the winter break. Another challenge in promoting alternative commuting projects is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars in society. Therefore, offering incentives is crucial. We offered gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have further increased participation. Increasing the value of the prizes over time might also have helped. While the gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement instead of decreasing it.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of index funds and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are very attractive, but the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, similar to buying a stock. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. While these benefits are clear, it's beneficial for savvy financial investors to evaluate whether these benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent. For this effort, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal risk-return ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, it would be impractical to include every holding, so we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land”, Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term, but there is a more contemporary source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book “Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon”, comments on the similarity between their two poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her death, he begins drinking heavily and crying for his departed queen. He then decides it is time for him to die and gives his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are quite similar, perhaps a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year before Poe’s use of the term “Thule” in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, he references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land”, the speaker describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be interpreted as a reflection of Goethe’s poem, as Goethe’s king has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author who Poe would have known, aside from his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson: “Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.”",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that punitive damages are justified, the plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer's accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive, it is still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is more relevant than ever today. Looking back at events since 9/11, I've personally observed a shift in American mainstream media's view of Islam and extremism from hostility to extreme tolerance. I don't think in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who had an obvious Muslim background in his family.\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts his personality. From what I know and have learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad was depicted as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which, people started to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious example is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\nThere are also many stories in the biography that seem to be part of their agenda to provide proof of 'witness' or how people 'spontaneously' converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, the author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard them from so-and-so, and so on. I didn't like this much because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\nI think what bothers me the most about this work is that they try to exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but think that if Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, they would react differently.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle demonstrates how people are fundamentally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and strive to make their lives as good as possible, without considering anyone below them. The novel shows this in several ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the large factories. All they care about is making their companies and factories as big and prosperous as possible. They do not care about anything or anyone that gets in their way or is harmed due to their advancement. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to depict the immense damage caused by this pollution. He shows that the owners have no concern for any person or animal that might be hurt. They do not care about the massive plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal waste and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also do not care about their employees working to make them wealthy. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then, without any notice, might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes these methods extensively in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/ gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he establishes meanings for white/gray and red/pink colors and uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with significant objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white signifying elegance and white/grey representing a higher social status, and gray indicating age and fading. He introduces this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone wears white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick gets his first impression of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by using them to color mundane subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), people at Gatsby's parties are listed under \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28)—symbolizing uniformity. He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"valley of ashes\" features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is an \"old gray man\" (27).\n\nAfter imbuing white/gray with sufficient meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her being a uniform addition, such as describing a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her being in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is known for its agricultural productivity, mainly due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a thriving market for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic products. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, encouraging recreational use, and providing opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical use. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming in some aspects. It requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil naturally. Organic farms often experience higher losses compared to conventional methods, and may lack the economies of scale seen in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops or removing invasive species, can also increase labor costs. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel for this scenario is located in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. The land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review, but it currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThe area has a long history of human habitation, with Native Americans living there for centuries. Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. A real estate website was used to find this piece of property, and available government programs were researched to understand cost-saving and wildlife-friendly operational options for a small farmer. A local organic farm in the same area served as a model for what might be achieved.",
            "Culture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it actually is and what it represents. Culture is not homogeneous, nor is it a specific thing; it is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture’s generalizations is appropriate, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitudes can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to their own culture, and comparisons naturally arise. Attempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward. It is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. Values are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is also found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. It is believed by the other author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas, who also argues for the existence of God. Given that each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, our task is to determine which argument is better. To simplify, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. To compare their arguments, we must assume the same type of God figure. Neither argument, however, provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage shows a path to understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot fully conceive of His non-existence. While his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that proof of God lies within our own minds. He suggests that truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is not needed. This is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence without the need for faith. This approach could aid in Christian evangelism by converting new believers through logical reasoning without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments supporting the existence of God, including arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. If you know you are missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, logic dictates you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Some time during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and attained enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. The religion is now around 2,500 years old; it looks different today than when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it has religious significance, although Buddha never taught about such a festival. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the core beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\nThere are several terms that will be frequently used in this discussion. The concepts of internal versus external forces will be mentioned. Here, internal forces refer to influences from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that do not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community but may do so accidentally. These terms will reappear throughout this discussion.\nFirst, it is crucial to examine the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka holds the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By understanding these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Along with Sansara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life, with laypeople having five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, no sexual misconduct, and not taking intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are a case of two nations that once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were many other conflicts between the two nations, which subsided just before World War I. The rivalry began with Americans and Mexicans clashing over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, and had a major conflict of material interests. This is not uncommon among nations that share a border, which often leads to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have enjoyed good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a schism between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which included ideological struggles and competitions over vital interests, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was primarily based on religious preferences. This distrust originated from the animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to dissipate as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended as \"American ambitions changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession from a deep-seated need for safety and security that I had lacked as a child. The mantra I heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am at 46 years old, single, with no financial cushion and unable to work. I've been disabled for 15 years, living on Social Security Disability and have nothing left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know one thing for sure: I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. When disaster strikes, you feel anything but strong.\n\nThe point is that emergencies, big and small, will always be a part of life. There are no guarantees, and no matter how prepared we are, some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely solely on big government; its system is flawed. However, I'd rather see Americans trusting and supporting each other again, learning to help one another and ask for help, rather than everyone fending for themselves in their own backyards.\n\nConservatives often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our country, but the truth is, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that kept our forefathers going. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the resources for a small farm, can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the improvements in child and maternal health rates fall far short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focus on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, leading to a high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Therefore, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this area is also a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expected levels, at around 4%. These rates also highlight another significant issue: while the rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas, indicating a problem with healthcare service equity. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas. Another access-related issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This suggests that the poor find it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to address the above-listed problems are appealing. Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target specific health sectors have clear, manageable objectives, but they also generally yield faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in programs for specific health areas can lead to other areas suffering from lack of funding and human resources being drawn to the better-funded sectors (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplicated services that are also uncoordinated, leading to increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of that era. Two novels that deviate from this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these novels incorporate an element of mystery and a penchant for the unconventional, which is atypical of the period. This strengthens the characters and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, clouds of bewildering and confusing ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention on himself, … he realized that he was talking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos reigned as some unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and function varying in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences frequently reveal some insight into Oliver’s inner self, the things that pained him, and his awareness of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage underscores Oliver’s lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state his health had reached. This is strongly present through Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelmed him; all his senses were numbed, and he did not notice the “unseen hand” that bore him away; he experienced his despair again, removed from the shock of pain, as the pain was now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver had little control over anything; he could not even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life was in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied here, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The days passed – day! There was no day; it came and went as quickly as the night, which seemed so long and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting moments.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program tutoring elementary age students. I tried to help them with whatever subjects they were struggling in, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was having a lot of trouble reading. I realized something was wrong; he had the most unusual problems. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't even get close to. He was of Latino descent, and I knew he spoke perfect English, but his reading issues seemed perplexing. We struggled, and it wasn't until I met his mother that I understood the problem. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. With my limited knowledge of Spanish, we managed to communicate. It was then that it dawned on me: Adrian could read fine; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to address the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It also serves to illustrate that the problem isn't always as apparent as we might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading it can still be a significant obstacle. We all agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively simple: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all of these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most children will not benefit. This is false. If we implemented these programs in the classroom as the rule, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and unrealistic. However, I do believe we can have special aides, tutors, or whatever they are called, who are bilingual.",
            "From the moment we are children, we are often told that there is something larger than ourselves and our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within ourselves. Many of us readily accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them, believing nothing exists beyond our personal perspective. We may switch from one set of values to another. Regardless of our path, we strive to define part of ourselves through our unique spiritual outlooks. We search for light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite birds.

The rainwater gushed through the gutters, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a mix of searching and reminiscing. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner and sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, deliberately avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate my father's suffering, but extended his life a few more months than the doctors had predicted; I struggled to find value in that. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to witness my father's transition from life to death. So, I did not. I could not watch the life that brought me into this world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else, better than his family, and I knew he would not want me to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, in both name and essence, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and disparaged, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' aspect. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary method. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic techniques to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition elements. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new novel format, allowing for a more personal exploration of character psychology, has kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers centuries removed from its original publication.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers due to the ideal of the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's eventual evolution into Romanticism and serving as a means to aspire to improve the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a period of political turmoil and despairing over the future. Immersed in politics and facing unfair accusations, he may have felt that the morality and innate goodness of the Gothic era had diminished in modern society. This is evident in several characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader recognizes chivalric traits in his description:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many traditional chivalric images; he is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the flow of processes moving goods from the customer order to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six key elements to provide the best customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are. Once managers have analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind customer demand and satisfaction must be met. After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process. Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a designed layout for every entity of the business, from how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipments from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product. All divisions consist of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is the best fit for the different processes of the product. Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nElliot Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, several street protests took place, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the government reluctantly allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but violence soon escalated to what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested on sight, including Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist who was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, quoted, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities happening in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive power over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be actual gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and seppuku, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports released by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich' was a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems mainly from his longevity and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his presence on the piano is often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex works that highlight the individual skills of his band members. He designed a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated phrases and arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his band members and emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra. This enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, particularly in the piece “Creole Love Call,” which uses the voice as a jazz instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. “Creole Love Call” also demonstrates his ability to complement the style of his soloists, which is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n1. Call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\n2. Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several blue notes.\n3. Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. Full-band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus where reeds take the lead in a call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice adopting the “growl” technique.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a tone color dimension to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nLater, in “Hot and Bothered,” recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal aspects of Miley’s playing and the instrumental elements of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” extends these ideas, with Ellington utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she had felt a persistent longing for something intangible. This unfulfilled desire had begun around the age of 14 and remained with her even at 17. She had come to realize she desired a person rather than a material thing, yet no boy had sparked her interest. Despite several attempts by others, she remained uninterested. She often questioned her own nature, wondering what could cause this peculiar situation in a young girl. Years of introspection had yielded no satisfactory answers, so she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nGenerally, days at home were peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm, rarely arguing, even with their daughter. The only conflict arose when she asserted her independence and lively personality. She was the daughter of a peaceful couple, but her exuberance made her easily liked, along with her innate niceness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she moved from room to room, seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, groaning in pain. She knelt beside her, \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother, struggling to speak through the pain, asked her daughter to take her to the hospital. The daughter, grateful for her physical strength, carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused solely on her mother. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her to be examined. Her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as lower stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial showed it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated through several studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, “probable” cases were included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse the results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hormones, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America’s most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must consider: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In brief, the financial crisis was brought about by selfish and naive political decisions that forced banks and companies to issue subprime loans into an immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks faced a shortage of capital reserves and passed this chaos on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the president sought reelection. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest home mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes later warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the introduction details, and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to excessive leverage by U.S. households and financial markets in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to even small price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were left with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That is the part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and take flight, leaving everyone amazed with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in a fun way.\n\nExposition is no friend of yours.\n\nMy dear readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still gets stuck in long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to tell your audience every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple language. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a long monologue of information, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. While reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, that they were married in a grand fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire episode to take two pages, during which both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would expect the heroine to demonstrate through big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later tells you straight out that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked like pure evil. Only two minutes were devoted to this story as it was still developing. They only provided that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. There had been no arrests at the time or any suspects. The SWAT team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe it might have been due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often glossed over when they are victims of a crime. For instance, if a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes crazy; but if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location. It was determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of the story was a bit short, but they used it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was about six feet tall, and weighed about 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and the darkness of his skin.\n\nAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure what the angle was, whether they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "Brothers share an unbreakable bond, an unassailable connection. This bond is filled with emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other more deeply than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they often see a reflection of themselves. It is in dire situations that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether it is for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they often come with great cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal bond is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look into their brother's eyes and see oneself, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions that surround it. In a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his younger brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He wanted a brother he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could be someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn… These things were obviously impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he would even survive. Even if he did, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. For the young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, this was a devastating blow. He even began to contemplate killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think of infanticide? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist so much hope! This shows that his conviction probably wasn't very strong. Deep down, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that while these metaphors are helpful, they can also lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object edges to recognize a box. Top-down processing uses these decisions to speed up identifying the box as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes to make available. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with specific methods for each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the printed word looks), phonemically (how the word sounds), or semantically (what the word means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are nodes, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the emerging threat of both technology and the capitalist system in his novel Brave New World. The society values collective happiness above individuality and conditions its citizens from birth to pursue pleasure above all else. Citizens are mere tools in the scheme of the World Controller, who imposes a single ideology. Through the lens of Marxist philosophy, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel critiques the flaws of the emerging economy of its time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relationships. This is achieved through ideological control of the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no genuine will of their own; their desire to consume and indulge is strengthened by hypnopædia, controlled by the World Controller. This manipulation is an example of hegemony, where a dominant group controls the lower classes, who unknowingly support this structure. The upper classes are aware of this manipulation but do not act. Few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, do more than accept their place. The interactions between social classes reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there is no genuine relationship between individuals. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism takes away people's free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial, as seen in men's comments about women's physical appearance and women's comments about their sexual encounters. Each class's complacency with its status in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their role in the community is evidence of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are made to feel superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I have studied at University Park for about two and a half years, or approximately four and a half semesters. For many people, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dormitory, which was the easternmost residence hall on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, as it often is in State College. An alumni slightly older than me mentioned that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traveling from one location to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility on a college campus? The bicycle is often the best option. However, having a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure should accommodate bicyclists.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had resumed bicycling after a few years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the only practical way to get around.” In addition to being beneficial for your health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as certain dorms. This year, the smartest decision I made was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is at least a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it isn't always an easy path to traverse by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on would consume more time than I can spare."
