            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in all negotiations. Culture can be defined both by what it is not and by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a concrete entity. It is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for negotiators to understand how culture impacts the matter at hand and how cultural attitudes influence negotiations. When someone encounters a foreign culture, they experience it through the lens of their own cultural background, and comparisons naturally emerge.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to transform a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially when one holds a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in \"away territory,\" showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't confined to national/international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or favor a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage charitable activities at all employee levels, while others restrict them to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. The diversity in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within companies across regions, including urban and suburban environments) demonstrates the variety of thinking that can exist within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they provide the underlying reasons for cultural behaviors. In cultures where saving face or group harmony is valued, a negotiator would never publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at the negotiating table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining may not be inclined to reach quick settlements. While considering these general principles before negotiations is important, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "\"The fool has declared in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening of St. Anselm's argument concerning God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine, appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is more compelling, we must, for brevity's sake, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. Considering any other divine concept would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they both specifically defend one particular concept of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach reflects understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, can be complex and sometimes unclear, the fundamental idea is that proof of God resides within one's mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is verified simply by examining what we inherently know to be true in our minds. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of truth without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis approach contrasts sharply with St. Thomas Aquinas's perspective. Aquinas contends that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for converting new believers without requiring them to accept unprovable concepts. Instead, they could be convinced through pure logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that proof of God lies in logical necessity. It's like knowing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it – you can deduce its existence and features by understanding the whole picture.",
            "Many writers employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques. Sometimes, he creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. At other times, he imbues symbols with specific meanings to achieve similar effects. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, he carefully constructs meanings for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically deploys these associations to trigger specific emotional responses in readers when encountering significant objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading glory. He establishes these associations early in the novel through persistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\"—indeed, white clothing appears ubiquitous: Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" to meet Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable deviation from this white motif occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane, unremarkable elements throughout the narrative, effectively creating a symbolic language of uniformity and social commentary.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and various peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products and eggs enjoy particular popularity. Many organic farms also offer educational tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tourism and educational initiatives that can generate additional revenue.\n\nOrganic farming, while serving a profitable market niche, promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. The practice requires more intensive manual labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and soil fertilization without chemical assistance. Crop losses tend to be higher than conventional farming, and small organic operations lack the economies of scale of larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, further increase labor costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, comprising chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjoins the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls face potential listing.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, and research was conducted on available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural development of this land.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions that stem from brotherly bonds means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not just a reflection of themselves as others perceive them, but their true essence. Their genuine character is revealed through their actions and the resulting consequences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, set against a richly detailed landscape. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to a tragic end where only one survives. The story's themes unfold through the detailed portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective illuminates the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle to their final tragic encounter, he harbors a mix of resentment and ambition. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures - swimming, running, climbing - and become his companion in childhood exploits. These aspirations were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests in dark thoughts, even contemplating harming his infant brother, though these thoughts dissipate when touched by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath his complex emotions, suggesting that his initial harsh feelings were overshadowed by a deeper brotherly affection.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and creative information processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. People first compared it to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, later to books, and most recently to computers. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, and light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain processes sensory information repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change distinctly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate object recognition. In this case, top-down processing might help you identify the object as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage is essential for brain processing. Multiple memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through specific protein structures.\n\nVarious models explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, or neurophysiological findings. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. The effects of this recession continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) faced pressure to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, when he sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes reported in The New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes presciently warned that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue operation similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn. His prediction would prove accurate as these lending practices contributed to the economic collapse.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years created deep interconnections between various economic sectors and the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical writing. Or more likely, it's where your readers doze off or click away while muttering curses about you. Dr. Merlin often finds herself yelling at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers know the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like that troublesome voice in your head suggesting you should rush through the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other nagging voice pushing you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially explaining events to your audience through straightforward narrative. In movies, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. In written fiction, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about the heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife. You'd expect to see how his presence transformed and enriched her life through various demonstrations (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection and understand the heroine better: her attractions, their bond's depth, her perspectives and aspirations as seen through his eyes. This way, readers would truly feel her loss when he dies.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic storyline beyond just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs an author, it's your job to add these layers of detail. Sometimes you might be tempted to rush through certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know their complete background - former Air Force, current night manager at a gas station, twice married, childless, weekend fishing enthusiast, dreams of owning the station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story covered an incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. While his wife's name wasn't disclosed, they showed his mugshot, which portrayed a truly menacing appearance. The developing story received about two minutes of coverage, only revealing that he had stabbed his wife multiple times and was in custody. The coverage time seemed appropriate.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no arrests or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was conducting the investigation. The brevity of this coverage appeared potentially linked to racial bias, as the victim was African American. I've observed over the years that crime coverage involving minority victims tends to be minimal, while crimes against white victims, especially in cases of kidnapping or missing persons, receive extensive media attention.\n\nThey then covered a story about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report detailed the suspected location of the incident and confirmed it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather report followed, forecasting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. Though brief, this segment seemed designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported on a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a tall, dark-skinned Black man in a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds. The coverage seemed to place undue emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, perhaps for dramatic effect. The unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed irrelevant to the story's substance.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase in single-share increments. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs generally maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay trading commissions like regular stocks. ETFs also offer investors access to a wide range of fund options.\n\nWhile these advantages are well-documented, prudent investors should carefully evaluate whether claimed benefits, particularly diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. This analysis focuses on examining the ETF IHF by comparing it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated their respective contributions to portfolio Beta and returns, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations reveal that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculated and normalized the standard deviation of each top 10 stock to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline. The arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The end of the fall semester in December brought increased workloads with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these demands. Furthermore, December's holiday season and the extended break meant many students and faculty weren't on campus at all. While the late January restart of classes might explain that month's low participation, the February numbers remain puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is addressing people's deep-seated attachment to the convenience and independence of personal vehicles - a core aspect of our culture. To encourage participation, we offered various incentives including gift certificates to local establishments like restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers. In retrospect, we wonder if larger prizes - such as a premium bicycle or even an electric or hybrid vehicle - might have sustained higher engagement levels. Our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, but a progressive increase in prize value might have helped maintain interest. While the initial gift cards proved adequate, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps an eco-friendly vehicle in January could have reversed the declining participation trend instead of watching it continue downward.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I examined all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films, while also noting the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. During this period, trick films generally followed certain conventions: they were filmed on sets, presented through a frontal theatrical view, featured static cameras, utilized long and medium shots, and adhered to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early 1900s began challenging these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films was their interior set filming within a front-facing theatrical frame. The camera remained stationary in its proscenium position, never following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly in vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. This stage-based approach meant that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining fixed even when they exit the frame.\n\nThis theatrical composition style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-ups, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following theatrical conventions, performers generally stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera closely enough to create close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a simple formula: one apparent shot constituted the entire film. This resulted in brief productions, typically lasting a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This format limited narrative possibilities, with most films focusing on short vaudeville-style illusions like magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as a single shot to viewers often comprised multiple physical shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot with the \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears continuous to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as Ian Watt notes in his work on the genre's rise. This literary form has experienced varied reception - from harsh criticism to high praise, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrated its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first true Gothic novel, masterfully combined elements from both ancient and modern romantic traditions to establish the foundational framework of the Gothic genre. Walpole integrated classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques that aimed to mirror natural life, creating what he termed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural traditions. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already acquired multiple meanings, referring to various peoples, artistic styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of being outdated or primitive compared to \"modern\" social and literary developments. However, the unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's intimate psychological perspective has allowed the genre to maintain its relevance while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most significant medieval concepts preserved in Gothic literature. In The Castle of Otranto, traditional chivalric ideals - the training and conduct of knights - are both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal of bravery, honor, and competence they found lacking in their contemporary society. Through the lens of chivalric traditions, the Gothic past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the later development of the Romantic movement and serving as a mirror to critique present society.\n\nWalpole wrote during a politically turbulent period, harboring concerns about the future. His involvement in politics and experience with controversial accusations may have led him to believe that the moral integrity and inherent goodness associated with the Gothic era had diminished in his contemporary society. This perspective is evident in his characterization of various figures, particularly Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric qualities. The character is portrayed with classical knightly attributes - as a prince who has endured hardship and tragedy, supposedly martyred by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is intentionally exaggerated, establishing the Gothic tradition of excess that would become characteristic of the genre.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nA supply chain consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain process, serves as its foundation. This stage determines the what, when, where, and how of production. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of consumer demands. Once they grasp these demands, managers can make informed decisions about product selection and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves workload scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. Every detail in this stage is crucial, as oversights can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine which division best suits each production process, sometimes opting to outsource work to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocratic class of the era. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this tradition. Both works employ elements of mystery and unusual characteristics that were uncommon in novels of that period, yet these features serve to strengthen the character development, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"At that moment, countless bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: their words still echoing in his ears; when he regained consciousness... he found himself talking to them.... Suddenly, gunshots rang out, making him jump back; loud shouts and cries filled the air; lights flickered before his eyes, and everything descended into chaos and tumult, as if an invisible hand was hastily carrying him away. Throughout these rapidly appearing visions, there remained a vague, unsettling sense of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n\nThese two novels frequently create mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his awareness of the true nature of events unfolding around him.",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something struck me as unusual: his problems were quite peculiar. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't manage at all, which was very strange. Though I knew he was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English. We continued struggling until I met his mother. While I was watching over a few students who didn't go on a field trip, his mother came in. She couldn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read fine; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a major hurdle. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these alone can solve the problem. The key lies in combining all these approaches!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear this approach wastes resources and won't benefit the majority of students, that's incorrect. If we implement these programs as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we accomplish this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aides or tutors.",
            "From childhood, most of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, while some search for answers within themselves. Many readily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these notions, denying anything beyond their self-centered universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the darkness, hoping it will guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while listening to rain drumming on the tin roof. Water cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his look both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt lonely and afraid, unable to tell my father how much I would miss him, knowing that speaking of it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, only extending his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't understand the value of this when it merely prolonged his pain. I asked myself what kind of God would do this. Alone in the night, I stopped praying. I thought if God existed, He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch him transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the end of the life that had created me. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator to his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held strong convictions about natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function justly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended creating a society based on common good and instead formed sub-societies thriving at others' expense. Good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored an extremely limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. With detached precision and practiced observation, I studied what lay before my eyes, deliberately avoiding any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed to operate independently of personal reflection, simply experiencing what I observed.\n\nFollowing an artist's recommendation, I had once purchased \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to master drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to complex neural processing of visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around the subject matter. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into manageable compositions - simply a bowl on a surface.\n\nYet now, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that artistic framing technique. The sight left me too stunned, too overwhelmed for anything but silent amazement. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here before me - if I dared call it art - was the beginning of my own masterpiece: A Study in Brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, my intentions manifesting in what could have been my greatest creative moment. Water swirled peacefully, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the handle again, but the brown mass remained stubbornly fixed to the toilet bowl's bottom, like an immovable slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at this unwelcome gift someone had left for the unfortunate bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After several more flushes and moments of philosophical contemplation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled a makeshift glove. Then, straightening up before bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, not unlike a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young lives are being lost in traffic accidents. Multiple factors contribute to these alarming statistics among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is that the teenage brain isn't physiologically prepared for driving's challenges. Lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads to higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road crashes.\n\nThe situation becomes even more dangerous when teens drive with their peers—something that happens frequently, as anyone would expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile California and other states have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers for teen drivers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains: statistically, the youngest drivers simply cannot adequately manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for full driving privileges, citing research published in USA Today that shows individuals under 19-20 often seek thrills purely for the sensation. This suggests that delaying driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes would be prudent. If we maintain current licensing practices, we face not only continued fatalities but potentially devastating numbers in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nA legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. The system would still include provisional permits and required training hours, based on existing state requirements (such as California's 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Given that teen driving statistics are problematic nationwide, uniform federal legislation could effectively protect young people across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't revolutionary—it's a practical response to a documented problem.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics or warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing abilities, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds in space, problems distinguishing between different sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking where one sound blocks another, difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequencing auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic methods often involve multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements.",
            "In pursuing a career in social work, I aim to work with the Division of Family and Children Services to support abused or neglected children and assist troubled families. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values are not merely professional requirements but deeply personal convictions.\n\nInitially, while I knew I wanted to help others, my career direction wasn't clear. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. After speaking with both the police and the parents, who dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes,\" I found my calling in social work.\n\nSocial justice stands as another crucial value in social work. Our society claims to value individuality while paradoxically promoting conformity. I've always challenged this contradiction, expressing my individuality through various forms of personal expression - from unconventional hair colors to multiple ear piercings. I've actively supported the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistently opposed racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and explains selected research to better illustrate each model. The research findings are then evaluated for their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental conditions, and sleep disorders related to other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining or achieving adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias concern sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental conditions stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic factors, hereditary elements, and physiological aspects. Research shows that hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically control sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration. These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating both genetic and environmental influences on human GABAB receptors. Receptor dysfunction could affect natural sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited phenotypes affecting these receptors could impact sleep regulation, potentially disrupting daily activities, academic performance, career success, and tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Getting around campus is a challenge for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, which is practically at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during State College's frequently unfavorable weather.\n\nA conversation with a recent alumnus revealed that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have been filled with athletic fields, major new structures including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone aren't the answer – students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nRecently, I spoke with a friend who had just returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic. There was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many upperclassmen, I now live off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bike, I can make this journey in just 5 minutes when riding quickly. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, can be challenging to navigate, whether on foot or by bike. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule doesn't allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine – that's over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats posed by technology and capitalistic structures through his creation of a dystopian society. In this world, communal values supersede individual identity, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist theoretical framework, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel's frequent use of Marxist concepts such as homogenization and reification reinforces its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economic system of Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general population is prevented from understanding their true economic relationship with other classes, as they are programmed to focus solely on personal satisfaction. This results from ideological control of the working class, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning programs in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller through hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a ruling elite. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates their own oppression. While upper classes are born with the potential for awareness, few besides characters like Bernard choose to question their prescribed roles. The interactions between social classes serve as powerful illustrations of capitalism's perceived oppressive nature.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack individual depth - possibly Huxley's commentary on how the convergence of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its autonomy and expressiveness. Love is nonexistent, and emotional extremes are suppressed; interactions remain superficial, evidenced by men's focus on women's physical attributes (their \"pneumatic\" qualities) and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further demonstrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their own importance as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal expectations.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I believe this question is even more pertinent today. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed mainstream media shift from an antagonistic view of Islam and extremists to an almost excessive tolerance of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have seemed impossible to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family history.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure, misunderstood yet humble, with people gradually recognizing the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nI've noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived among miracles. This approach troubles me as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's unique miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly designed to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes the accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This image appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history broadly, we can observe Christianity gradually departing from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and resist any thinking beyond their learned boundaries, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical consciousness will greatly expand in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. While this may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in Christian historical trends. It will return to its original form. A growing movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message from God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through America and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as they would in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong in leading the way. However, as the theological clock reverses, Christianity's extreme diversity will transform into increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, rejected, and killed by the Roman Empire, yet later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal ahead will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its origins while eliminating diversity. Importantly, what will make this process possible is an approach to reading Jesus's words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. So what has transpired since Jesus's time? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. When Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, monotheism, the concept of divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally focus on their own wellbeing and advancement, often disregarding those beneath them. This theme manifests throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing profits, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair highlights the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrialization. The owners show no concern for the harmful effects of their factories' pollution or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends to their workforce, whom they treat as disposable resources. As the text states, \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face brutal hours, arbitrary layoffs without notice, and no job security or compensation. In this era, the absence of labor laws and regulations allowed management to operate with impunity, forcing workers to maintain impossible productivity levels in dangerous conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown were essentially trapped in a system of modern slavery, with no recourse or support systems. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. As the novel points out, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. While Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain that Greeks considered the edge of the known world, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, as Poe had a strong interest in German literature.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems and concludes that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the tale of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he descends into heavy drinking and mourning for his departed queen. Deciding it's time to die, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The emotional state of the King of Thule bears striking resemblance to the king's description in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol. H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama in 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"",
            "Under California law, a customer's claim for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall incident involving an applesauce spill at a grocery store warrants careful consideration. The case centers on whether the store manager's conduct demonstrated malice by failing to address a reported hazard for thirty minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe judge is likely to allow Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim to proceed. To justify punitive damages in California, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can make a compelling argument that Manager Martin should have anticipated the dangers of an unattended spill, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered similar accidents in recent months. While the argument for \"despicable\" conduct may be less straightforward, it remains reasonable given the store's history of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's apparent indifference to safety protocols.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when employee Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Manager Paul Martin at 5:00 PM. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the concern, stating he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" A second employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the same hazard at 5:15 PM, receiving a similar dismissive response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer suffered a serious back injury after slipping on the unremedied spill. This incident followed five previous slip-and-fall accidents at D&D Markets that same year.\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded in non-contractual cases where the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful acts or \"despicable\" behavior showing willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. California courts have interpreted malicious conduct to include situations where defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet deliberately failed to prevent them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt an inexplicable emptiness within her, a yearning that couldn't be satisfied. This feeling first emerged when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. Eventually, she realized what she craved wasn't something, but someone. Yet strangely, she felt no attraction to any boys. Though some had shown interest in her, awkwardly attempting to court the uncourt-able, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, perpetually puzzled by her own desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed individuals who rarely argued, either with each other or with their daughter. The only occasional conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Born to this serene couple, she provided a striking contrast with her vibrant, outgoing personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her widely likeable.\n\nHowever, this particular day was anything but peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, breathing heavily and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her mother, she reached out to help. Between labored breaths, her mother managed, \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Grateful for her strength training, she carefully followed her mother's instructions on how to lift her, carried her to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital visit brought its typical mix of antiseptic smells and anxiety, though she barely noticed, focused entirely on her mother's wellbeing. She carried her mother in, urgently calling for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney and whisking her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait in worried suspense.\n\nThe incident had occurred when her mother fell from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research established a negative correlation between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women aged 38-63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were designated as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and CHD and stroke risk, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed diet scores, was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, researchers documented 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "According to the sign, Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation that has been under the control of a militant dictatorship since their 1962 coup d'état. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led by Buddhist monks, became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of their traditional robes. While the protests initially started small, they soon gained widespread public support. Though the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation quickly deteriorated into what many described as open warfare between the monastery and military, with forces raiding temples nationwide. Foreign journalists faced immediate arrest, and on September 27th, 2007, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai was killed simply for documenting a protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed that \"The actual death toll reaches several thousand - far more than reported.\"\n\nThis pattern of oppression is nothing new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors being viewed as living gods, to modern-day political dynamics involving figures like President George W. Bush and his associations with religious conservative leaders, the struggle for power persists.\n\nNotable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where students, intellectuals, and workers gathered to challenge government authority. Death toll estimates vary dramatically - from the government's claim of 200-300 to the Chinese Red Cross's estimate of 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, which spanned multiple years and countries, represents another extreme case of systematic persecution, specifically targeting Jewish populations for extermination.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original sounds tailored to each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and brilliant works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative approach, Creole Love Call is noted for its pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" - a technique he would employ throughout his career. This piece exemplifies Ellington's early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while also demonstrating his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. This measured, twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that transition to a rougher texture.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the core melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: An expansive clarinet solo in upper register, supported by subtle syncopated piano.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its peak as reeds initiate the call and response in high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the original format, featuring voice-reed dialogue with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nEnding: A short tag featuring a vocal run and an unconventional dissonant trombone conclusion.\n\nThis innovative use of voice as a tonal element became a hallmark of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with remarkable effect.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in specific ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now, zoologists have barely begun to define the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" this observation remains relevant today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms controlling the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns, called whorls, rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis, running through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate of whorl expansion can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described as follows: First, view the shell from above and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal secretes (builds) its shell. The aperture's path can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well toward many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be examined below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has improved its rate of births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the progress shown by this indicator is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still necessary. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional healthcare treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low rates observed nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system. While vertical, program-specific approaches are appealing due to their focused objectives and quick results, they have notable drawbacks. These include the potential diversion of resources and personnel from other health sectors (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services) and the inefficient duplication of services across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved so extensively over the past century that it now encompasses countless genres, making it nearly impossible to compile a complete list. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and even further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit often leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, we've reached a point where the sheer number of niches makes it challenging to define exactly what heavy metal is. While it has incorporated numerous elements from other genres, like everything else, it has its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend the metal music that pervades our world today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just another genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be understood as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It favors technical proficiency over primitivism; metal musicians are notably skilled at their instruments, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental mindsets, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, with drugs often serving as both inspiration and scapegoat. The movement embodies many dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, as much of popular music had traditionally shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent in the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" not only depicts a woman mesmerized by the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, though this pursuit presented him with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and unique artistic voice.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a moderately prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight of their infant children, left Rousseau with just one surviving daughter, Julia, and overwhelming grief. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasant life in their works, Rousseau remained essentially a folk artist, expressing the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside numerous accomplished and well-established modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. As Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, had fundamentally different motivations: while Matisse strived to avoid conventional painting at all costs, Rousseau's greatest desire was to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life comes through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of goodness or beauty. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite artwork or literary piece, people often preface their detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe neither art nor morality can be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our most complete descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature creates a bridge between them.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful unified nation, with a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This same cultural thread weaves through Cologne along the Rhine, across Germany's heartland, to Dresden, the Saxon city on the Elbe River. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first introduced the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, adopting it from the Gauls to differentiate between his conquered territories and the unconquered lands. While the name's true origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to \"neighbor\" in Gallic, while others connect it to the Germanic spear called \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, writing in 98 AD, portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other races. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate over the comforts of Asia, Africa, or Italy, unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves were initially reluctant to settle in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading local goods and offering their military service to the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can be an effective tool for sustained deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their true selves permanently. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, as it may lead to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take grave offense at the masquerade.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such acts. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes more complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino, who believes her to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that surface through their interactions with Viola/Cesario. However, rather than suggesting Olivia has latent same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely uses her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest, as shown in her declaration: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "Various observers have noted the brutality of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, it would be overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad description. The German colonial empire exhibited diverse policies and governing styles across its various territories. Educational systems also varied significantly among the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established public schools and actively participated in native education, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary organizations with minimal government support. However, the government invested considerably in European education within the colony, establishing state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools serving Europeans. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies produced significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated, untouched, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's distinct experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding settler and colonial authority attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing colonial educational systems. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the two colonies' educational systems and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many of its distinctive educational characteristics.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 white residents.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple confrontations occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The conflict originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent countries. As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only nations presenting persistent, comprehensive diplomatic challenges for America. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these rivalrous relationships, while other Latin American nations have maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) observes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, although I dreamed of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing instead.\n\nHowever, there I was: 46, single, with barely any savings, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know is true: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too big to overcome alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being considered the most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five centuries; its present form differs significantly from how it existed during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal forces, whether hostile or benign.\n\nThis discussion employs several qualifying terms. The first distinction is between internal and external forces. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those coming from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks must adhere to many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First is Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.

            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in all negotiations. Culture can be defined both by what it is not and by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a concrete entity. It is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for negotiators to understand how culture impacts the matter at hand and how cultural attitudes influence negotiations. When someone encounters a foreign culture, they experience it through the lens of their own cultural background, and comparisons naturally emerge.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to transform a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially when one holds a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in \"away territory,\" showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't confined to national/international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or favor a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage charitable activities at all employee levels, while others restrict them to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. The diversity in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within companies across regions, including urban and suburban environments) demonstrates the variety of thinking that can exist within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they provide the underlying reasons for cultural behaviors. In cultures where saving face or group harmony is valued, a negotiator would never publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at the negotiating table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining may not be inclined to reach quick settlements. While considering these general principles before negotiations is important, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "\"The fool has declared in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening of St. Anselm's argument concerning God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine, appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is more compelling, we must, for brevity's sake, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. Considering any other divine concept would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they both specifically defend one particular concept of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach reflects understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, can be complex and sometimes unclear, the fundamental idea is that proof of God resides within one's mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is verified simply by examining what we inherently know to be true in our minds. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of truth without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis approach contrasts sharply with St. Thomas Aquinas's perspective. Aquinas contends that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for converting new believers without requiring them to accept unprovable concepts. Instead, they could be convinced through pure logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that proof of God lies in logical necessity. It's like knowing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it – you can deduce its existence and features by understanding the whole picture.",
            "Many writers employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques. Sometimes, he creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. At other times, he imbues symbols with specific meanings to achieve similar effects. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, he carefully constructs meanings for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically deploys these associations to trigger specific emotional responses in readers when encountering significant objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading glory. He establishes these associations early in the novel through persistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\"—indeed, white clothing appears ubiquitous: Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" to meet Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable deviation from this white motif occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane, unremarkable elements throughout the narrative, effectively creating a symbolic language of uniformity and social commentary.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and various peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products and eggs enjoy particular popularity. Many organic farms also offer educational tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tourism and educational initiatives that can generate additional revenue.\n\nOrganic farming, while serving a profitable market niche, promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. The practice requires more intensive manual labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and soil fertilization without chemical assistance. Crop losses tend to be higher than conventional farming, and small organic operations lack the economies of scale of larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, further increase labor costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, comprising chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjoins the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls face potential listing.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, and research was conducted on available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural development of this land.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions that stem from brotherly bonds means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not just a reflection of themselves as others perceive them, but their true essence. Their genuine character is revealed through their actions and the resulting consequences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, set against a richly detailed landscape. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to a tragic end where only one survives. The story's themes unfold through the detailed portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective illuminates the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle to their final tragic encounter, he harbors a mix of resentment and ambition. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures - swimming, running, climbing - and become his companion in childhood exploits. These aspirations were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests in dark thoughts, even contemplating harming his infant brother, though these thoughts dissipate when touched by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath his complex emotions, suggesting that his initial harsh feelings were overshadowed by a deeper brotherly affection.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and creative information processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. People first compared it to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, later to books, and most recently to computers. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, and light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain processes sensory information repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change distinctly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate object recognition. In this case, top-down processing might help you identify the object as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage is essential for brain processing. Multiple memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through specific protein structures.\n\nVarious models explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, or neurophysiological findings. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. The effects of this recession continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) faced pressure to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, when he sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes reported in The New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes presciently warned that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue operation similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn. His prediction would prove accurate as these lending practices contributed to the economic collapse.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years created deep interconnections between various economic sectors and the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical writing. Or more likely, it's where your readers doze off or click away while muttering curses about you. Dr. Merlin often finds herself yelling at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers know the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like that troublesome voice in your head suggesting you should rush through the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other nagging voice pushing you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially explaining events to your audience through straightforward narrative. In movies, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. In written fiction, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about the heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife. You'd expect to see how his presence transformed and enriched her life through various demonstrations (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection and understand the heroine better: her attractions, their bond's depth, her perspectives and aspirations as seen through his eyes. This way, readers would truly feel her loss when he dies.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic storyline beyond just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs an author, it's your job to add these layers of detail.

Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know their complete background - former Air Force, current night manager at a gas station, twice married, childless, weekend fishing enthusiast, dreams of owning the station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story covered an incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. While his wife's name wasn't disclosed, they showed his mugshot, which portrayed a truly menacing appearance. The developing story received about two minutes of coverage, only revealing that he had stabbed his wife multiple times and was in custody. The coverage time seemed appropriate.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no arrests or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was conducting the investigation. The brevity of this coverage appeared potentially linked to racial bias, as the victim was African American. I've observed over the years that crime coverage involving minority victims tends to be minimal, while crimes against white victims, especially in cases of kidnapping or missing persons, receive extensive media attention.\n\nThey then covered a story about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report detailed the suspected location of the incident and confirmed it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather report followed, forecasting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. Though brief, this segment seemed designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported on a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a tall, dark-skinned Black man in a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds. The coverage seemed to place undue emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, perhaps for dramatic effect. The unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed irrelevant to the story's substance.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase in single-share increments. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs generally maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay trading commissions like regular stocks. ETFs also offer investors access to a wide range of fund options.\n\nWhile these advantages are well-documented, prudent investors should carefully evaluate whether claimed benefits, particularly diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. This analysis focuses on examining the ETF IHF by comparing it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated their respective contributions to portfolio Beta and returns, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations reveal that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculated and normalized the standard deviation of each top 10 stock to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline. The arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The end of the fall semester in December brought increased workloads with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these demands. Furthermore, December's holiday season and the extended break meant many students and faculty weren't on campus at all. While the late January restart of classes might explain that month's low participation, the February numbers remain puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is addressing people's deep-seated attachment to the convenience and independence of personal vehicles - a core aspect of our culture. To encourage participation, we offered various incentives including gift certificates to local establishments like restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers. In retrospect, we wonder if larger prizes - such as a premium bicycle or even an electric or hybrid vehicle - might have sustained higher engagement levels. Our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, but a progressive increase in prize value might have helped maintain interest. While the initial gift cards proved adequate, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps an eco-friendly vehicle in January could have reversed the declining participation trend instead of watching it continue downward.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I examined all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films, while also noting the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. During this period, trick films generally followed certain conventions: they were filmed on sets, presented through a frontal theatrical view, featured static cameras, utilized long and medium shots, and adhered to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early 1900s began challenging these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films was their interior set filming within a front-facing theatrical frame. The camera remained stationary in its proscenium position, never following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly in vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. This stage-based approach meant that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining fixed even when they exit the frame.\n\nThis theatrical composition style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-ups, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following theatrical conventions, performers generally stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera closely enough to create close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a simple formula: one apparent shot constituted the entire film. This resulted in brief productions, typically lasting a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This format limited narrative possibilities, with most films focusing on short vaudeville-style illusions like magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as a single shot to viewers often comprised multiple physical shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot with the \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears continuous to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as Ian Watt notes in his work on the genre's rise. This literary form has experienced varied reception - from harsh criticism to high praise, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrated its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first true Gothic novel, masterfully combined elements from both ancient and modern romantic traditions to establish the foundational framework of the Gothic genre. Walpole integrated classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques that aimed to mirror natural life, creating what he termed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural traditions. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already acquired multiple meanings, referring to various peoples, artistic styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of being outdated or primitive compared to \"modern\" social and literary developments. However, the unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's intimate psychological perspective has allowed the genre to maintain its relevance while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most significant medieval concepts preserved in Gothic literature. In The Castle of Otranto, traditional chivalric ideals - the training and conduct of knights - are both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal of bravery, honor, and competence they found lacking in their contemporary society. Through the lens of chivalric traditions, the Gothic past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the later development of the Romantic movement and serving as a mirror to critique present society.\n\nWalpole wrote during a politically turbulent period, harboring concerns about the future. His involvement in politics and experience with controversial accusations may have led him to believe that the moral integrity and inherent goodness associated with the Gothic era had diminished in his contemporary society. This perspective is evident in his characterization of various figures, particularly Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric qualities. The character is portrayed with classical knightly attributes - as a prince who has endured hardship and tragedy, supposedly martyred by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is intentionally exaggerated, establishing the Gothic tradition of excess that would become characteristic of the genre.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nA supply chain consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain process, serves as its foundation. This stage determines the what, when, where, and how of production. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of consumer demands. Once they grasp these demands, managers can make informed decisions about product selection and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves workload scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. Every detail in this stage is crucial, as oversights can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine which division best suits each production process, sometimes opting to outsource work to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocratic class of the era. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this tradition. Both works employ elements of mystery and unusual characteristics that were uncommon in novels of that period, yet these features serve to strengthen the character development, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"At that moment, countless bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: their words still echoing in his ears; when he regained consciousness... he found himself talking to them.... Suddenly, gunshots rang out, making him jump back; loud shouts and cries filled the air; lights flickered before his eyes, and everything descended into chaos and tumult, as if an invisible hand was hastily carrying him away. Throughout these rapidly appearing visions, there remained a vague, unsettling sense of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n\nThese two novels frequently create mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his awareness of the true nature of events unfolding around him.",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something struck me as unusual: his problems were quite peculiar. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't manage at all, which was very strange. Though I knew he was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English. We continued struggling until I met his mother. While I was watching over a few students who didn't go on a field trip, his mother came in. She couldn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read fine; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a major hurdle. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these alone can solve the problem. The key lies in combining all these approaches!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear this approach wastes resources and won't benefit the majority of students, that's incorrect. If we implement these programs as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we accomplish this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aides or tutors.",
            "From childhood, most of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, while some search for answers within themselves. Many readily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these notions, denying anything beyond their self-centered universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the darkness, hoping it will guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while listening to rain drumming on the tin roof. Water cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his look both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt lonely and afraid, unable to tell my father how much I would miss him, knowing that speaking of it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, only extending his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't understand the value of this when it merely prolonged his pain. I asked myself what kind of God would do this. Alone in the night, I stopped praying. I thought if God existed, He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch him transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the end of the life that had created me. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator to his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held strong convictions about natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function justly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended creating a society based on common good and instead formed sub-societies thriving at others' expense. Good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored an extremely limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. With detached precision and practiced observation, I studied what lay before my eyes, deliberately avoiding any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed to operate independently of personal reflection, simply experiencing what I observed.\n\nFollowing an artist's recommendation, I had once purchased \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to master drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to complex neural processing of visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around the subject matter. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into manageable compositions - simply a bowl on a surface.\n\nYet now, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that artistic framing technique. The sight left me too stunned, too overwhelmed for anything but silent amazement. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here before me - if I dared call it art - was the beginning of my own masterpiece: A Study in Brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, my intentions manifesting in what could have been my greatest creative moment. Water swirled peacefully, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the handle again, but the brown mass remained stubbornly fixed to the toilet bowl's bottom, like an immovable slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at this unwelcome gift someone had left for the unfortunate bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After several more flushes and moments of philosophical contemplation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled a makeshift glove. Then, straightening up before bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, not unlike a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young lives are being lost in traffic accidents. Multiple factors contribute to these alarming statistics among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is that the teenage brain isn't physiologically prepared for driving's challenges. Lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads to higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road crashes.\n\nThe situation becomes even more dangerous when teens drive with their peers—something that happens frequently, as anyone would expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile California and other states have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers for teen drivers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains: statistically, the youngest drivers simply cannot adequately manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for full driving privileges, citing research published in USA Today that shows individuals under 19-20 often seek thrills purely for the sensation. This suggests that delaying driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes would be prudent. If we maintain current licensing practices, we face not only continued fatalities but potentially devastating numbers in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nA legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. The system would still include provisional permits and required training hours, based on existing state requirements (such as California's 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Given that teen driving statistics are problematic nationwide, uniform federal legislation could effectively protect young people across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't revolutionary—it's a practical response to a documented problem.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics or warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing abilities, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds in space, problems distinguishing between different sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking where one sound blocks another, difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequencing auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic methods often involve multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements.",
            "In pursuing a career in social work, I aim to work with the Division of Family and Children Services to support abused or neglected children and assist troubled families. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values are not merely professional requirements but deeply personal convictions.\n\nInitially, while I knew I wanted to help others, my career direction wasn't clear. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. After speaking with both the police and the parents, who dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes,\" I found my calling in social work.\n\nSocial justice stands as another crucial value in social work. Our society claims to value individuality while paradoxically promoting conformity. I've always challenged this contradiction, expressing my individuality through various forms of personal expression - from unconventional hair colors to multiple ear piercings. I've actively supported the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistently opposed racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and explains selected research to better illustrate each model. The research findings are then evaluated for their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental conditions, and sleep disorders related to other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining or achieving adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias concern sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental conditions stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic factors, hereditary elements, and physiological aspects. Research shows that hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically control sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration. These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating both genetic and environmental influences on human GABAB receptors. Receptor dysfunction could affect natural sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited phenotypes affecting these receptors could impact sleep regulation, potentially disrupting daily activities, academic performance, career success, and tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Getting around campus is a challenge for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, which is practically at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during State College's frequently unfavorable weather.\n\nA conversation with a recent alumnus revealed that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have been filled with athletic fields, major new structures including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone aren't the answer – students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nRecently, I spoke with a friend who had just returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic. There was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many upperclassmen, I now live off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bike, I can make this journey in just 5 minutes when riding quickly. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, can be challenging to navigate, whether on foot or by bike. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule doesn't allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine – that's over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats posed by technology and capitalistic structures through his creation of a dystopian society. In this world, communal values supersede individual identity, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist theoretical framework, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel's frequent use of Marxist concepts such as homogenization and reification reinforces its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economic system of Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general population is prevented from understanding their true economic relationship with other classes, as they are programmed to focus solely on personal satisfaction. This results from ideological control of the working class, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning programs in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller through hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a ruling elite. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates their own oppression. While upper classes are born with the potential for awareness, few besides characters like Bernard choose to question their prescribed roles. The interactions between social classes serve as powerful illustrations of capitalism's perceived oppressive nature.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack individual depth - possibly Huxley's commentary on how the convergence of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its autonomy and expressiveness. Love is nonexistent, and emotional extremes are suppressed; interactions remain superficial, evidenced by men's focus on women's physical attributes (their \"pneumatic\" qualities) and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further demonstrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their own importance as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal expectations.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I believe this question is even more pertinent today. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed mainstream media shift from an antagonistic view of Islam and extremists to an almost excessive tolerance of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have seemed impossible to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family history.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure, misunderstood yet humble, with people gradually recognizing the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nI've noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived among miracles. This approach troubles me as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's unique miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly designed to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes the accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This image appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history broadly, we can observe Christianity gradually departing from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and resist any thinking beyond their learned boundaries, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical consciousness will greatly expand in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. While this may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in Christian historical trends. It will return to its original form. A growing movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message from God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through America and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as they would in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong in leading the way. However, as the theological clock reverses, Christianity's extreme diversity will transform into increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, rejected, and killed by the Roman Empire, yet later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal ahead will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its origins while eliminating diversity. Importantly, what will make this process possible is an approach to reading Jesus's words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. So what has transpired since Jesus's time? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. When Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, monotheism, the concept of divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally focus on their own wellbeing and advancement, often disregarding those beneath them. This theme manifests throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing profits, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair highlights the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrialization. The owners show no concern for the harmful effects of their factories' pollution or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends to their workforce, whom they treat as disposable resources. As the text states, \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face brutal hours, arbitrary layoffs without notice, and no job security or compensation. In this era, the absence of labor laws and regulations allowed management to operate with impunity, forcing workers to maintain impossible productivity levels in dangerous conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown were essentially trapped in a system of modern slavery, with no recourse or support systems. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. As the novel points out, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. While Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain that Greeks considered the edge of the known world, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, as Poe had a strong interest in German literature.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems and concludes that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the tale of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he descends into heavy drinking and mourning for his departed queen. Deciding it's time to die, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The emotional state of the King of Thule bears striking resemblance to the king's description in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol. H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama in 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"",
            "Under California law, a customer's claim for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall incident involving an applesauce spill at a grocery store warrants careful consideration. The case centers on whether the store manager's conduct demonstrated malice by failing to address a reported hazard for thirty minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe judge is likely to allow Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim to proceed. To justify punitive damages in California, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can make a compelling argument that Manager Martin should have anticipated the dangers of an unattended spill, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered similar accidents in recent months. While the argument for \"despicable\" conduct may be less straightforward, it remains reasonable given the store's history of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's apparent indifference to safety protocols.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when employee Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Manager Paul Martin at 5:00 PM. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the concern, stating he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" A second employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the same hazard at 5:15 PM, receiving a similar dismissive response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer suffered a serious back injury after slipping on the unremedied spill. This incident followed five previous slip-and-fall accidents at D&D Markets that same year.\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded in non-contractual cases where the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful acts or \"despicable\" behavior showing willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. California courts have interpreted malicious conduct to include situations where defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet deliberately failed to prevent them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt an inexplicable emptiness within her, a yearning that couldn't be satisfied. This feeling first emerged when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. Eventually, she realized what she craved wasn't something, but someone. Yet strangely, she felt no attraction to any boys. Though some had shown interest in her, awkwardly attempting to court the uncourt-able, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, perpetually puzzled by her own desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed individuals who rarely argued, either with each other or with their daughter. The only occasional conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Born to this serene couple, she provided a striking contrast with her vibrant, outgoing personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her widely likeable.\n\nHowever, this particular day was anything but peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, breathing heavily and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her mother, she reached out to help. Between labored breaths, her mother managed, \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Grateful for her strength training, she carefully followed her mother's instructions on how to lift her, carried her to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital visit brought its typical mix of antiseptic smells and anxiety, though she barely noticed, focused entirely on her mother's wellbeing. She carried her mother in, urgently calling for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney and whisking her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait in worried suspense.\n\nThe incident had occurred when her mother fell from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research established a negative correlation between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women aged 38-63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were designated as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and CHD and stroke risk, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed diet scores, was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, researchers documented 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "According to the sign, Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation that has been under the control of a militant dictatorship since their 1962 coup d'état. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led by Buddhist monks, became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of their traditional robes. While the protests initially started small, they soon gained widespread public support. Though the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation quickly deteriorated into what many described as open warfare between the monastery and military, with forces raiding temples nationwide. Foreign journalists faced immediate arrest, and on September 27th, 2007, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai was killed simply for documenting a protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed that \"The actual death toll reaches several thousand - far more than reported.\"\n\nThis pattern of oppression is nothing new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors being viewed as living gods, to modern-day political dynamics involving figures like President George W. Bush and his associations with religious conservative leaders, the struggle for power persists.\n\nNotable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where students, intellectuals, and workers gathered to challenge government authority. Death toll estimates vary dramatically - from the government's claim of 200-300 to the Chinese Red Cross's estimate of 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, which spanned multiple years and countries, represents another extreme case of systematic persecution, specifically targeting Jewish populations for extermination.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original sounds tailored to each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and brilliant works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative approach, Creole Love Call is noted for its pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" - a technique he would employ throughout his career. This piece exemplifies Ellington's early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while also demonstrating his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. This measured, twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that transition to a rougher texture.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the core melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: An expansive clarinet solo in upper register, supported by subtle syncopated piano.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its peak as reeds initiate the call and response in high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the original format, featuring voice-reed dialogue with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nEnding: A short tag featuring a vocal run and an unconventional dissonant trombone conclusion.\n\nThis innovative use of voice as a tonal element became a hallmark of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with remarkable effect.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in specific ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now, zoologists have barely begun to define the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" this observation remains relevant today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms controlling the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns, called whorls, rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis, running through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate of whorl expansion can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described as follows: First, view the shell from above and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal secretes (builds) its shell. The aperture's path can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well toward many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be examined below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has improved its rate of births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the progress shown by this indicator is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still necessary. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional healthcare treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low rates observed nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system. While vertical, program-specific approaches are appealing due to their focused objectives and quick results, they have notable drawbacks. These include the potential diversion of resources and personnel from other health sectors (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services) and the inefficient duplication of services across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved so extensively over the past century that it now encompasses countless genres, making it nearly impossible to compile a complete list. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and even further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit often leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, we've reached a point where the sheer number of niches makes it challenging to define exactly what heavy metal is. While it has incorporated numerous elements from other genres, like everything else, it has its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend the metal music that pervades our world today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just another genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be understood as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It favors technical proficiency over primitivism; metal musicians are notably skilled at their instruments, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental mindsets, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, with drugs often serving as both inspiration and scapegoat. The movement embodies many dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, as much of popular music had traditionally shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent in the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" not only depicts a woman mesmerized by the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, though this pursuit presented him with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and unique artistic voice.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a moderately prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight of their infant children, left Rousseau with just one surviving daughter, Julia, and overwhelming grief. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasant life in their works, Rousseau remained essentially a folk artist, expressing the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside numerous accomplished and well-established modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. As Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, had fundamentally different motivations: while Matisse strived to avoid conventional painting at all costs, Rousseau's greatest desire was to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life comes through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of goodness or beauty. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite artwork or literary piece, people often preface their detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe neither art nor morality can be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our most complete descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature creates a bridge between them.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful unified nation, with a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This same cultural thread weaves through Cologne along the Rhine, across Germany's heartland, to Dresden, the Saxon city on the Elbe River. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first introduced the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, adopting it from the Gauls to differentiate between his conquered territories and the unconquered lands. While the name's true origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to \"neighbor\" in Gallic, while others connect it to the Germanic spear called \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, writing in 98 AD, portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other races. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate over the comforts of Asia, Africa, or Italy, unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves were initially reluctant to settle in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading local goods and offering their military service to the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can be an effective tool for sustained deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their true selves permanently. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, as it may lead to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take grave offense at the masquerade.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such acts. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes more complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino, who believes her to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that surface through their interactions with Viola/Cesario. However, rather than suggesting Olivia has latent same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely uses her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest, as shown in her declaration: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "Various observers have noted the brutality of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, it would be overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad description. The German colonial empire exhibited diverse policies and governing styles across its various territories. Educational systems also varied significantly among the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established public schools and actively participated in native education, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary organizations with minimal government support. However, the government invested considerably in European education within the colony, establishing state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools serving Europeans. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies produced significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated, untouched, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's distinct experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding settler and colonial authority attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing colonial educational systems. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the two colonies' educational systems and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many of its distinctive educational characteristics.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 white residents.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple confrontations occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The conflict originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent countries. As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only nations presenting persistent, comprehensive diplomatic challenges for America. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these rivalrous relationships, while other Latin American nations have maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) observes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, although I dreamed of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing instead.\n\nHowever, there I was: 46, single, with barely any savings, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know is true: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too big to overcome alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being considered the most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five centuries; its present form differs significantly from how it existed during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal forces, whether hostile or benign.\n\nThis discussion employs several qualifying terms. The first distinction is between internal and external forces. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those coming from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks must adhere to many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First is Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in all negotiations. Culture can be defined both by what it is not and by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a concrete entity. It is neither singular nor uniform. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for negotiators to understand how culture impacts the matter at hand and how cultural attitudes influence negotiations. When someone encounters a foreign culture, they experience it through the lens of their own cultural background, and comparisons naturally emerge.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to transform a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially when one holds a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in \"away territory,\" showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't confined to national/international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or favor a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage charitable activities at all employee levels, while others restrict them to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. The diversity in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within companies across regions, including urban and suburban environments) demonstrates the variety of thinking that can exist within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they provide the underlying reasons for cultural behaviors. In cultures where saving face or group harmony is valued, a negotiator would never publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at the negotiating table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining may not be inclined to reach quick settlements. While considering these general principles before negotiations is important, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "\"The fool has declared in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening of St. Anselm's argument concerning God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine, appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is more compelling, we must, for brevity's sake, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. Considering any other divine concept would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they both specifically defend one particular concept of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach reflects understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, can be complex and sometimes unclear, the fundamental idea is that proof of God resides within one's mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is verified simply by examining what we inherently know to be true in our minds. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of truth without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis approach contrasts sharply with St. Thomas Aquinas's perspective. Aquinas contends that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would be particularly valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for converting new believers without requiring them to accept unprovable concepts. Instead, they could be convinced through pure logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that proof of God lies in logical necessity. It's like knowing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it – you can deduce its existence and features by understanding the whole picture.",
            "Many writers employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques. Sometimes, he creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. At other times, he imbues symbols with specific meanings to achieve similar effects. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, he carefully constructs meanings for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically deploys these associations to trigger specific emotional responses in readers when encountering significant objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading glory. He establishes these associations early in the novel through persistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\"—indeed, white clothing appears ubiquitous: Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" to meet Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable deviation from this white motif occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane, unremarkable elements throughout the narrative, effectively creating a symbolic language of uniformity and social commentary.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and various peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products and eggs enjoy particular popularity. Many organic farms also offer educational tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tourism and educational initiatives that can generate additional revenue.\n\nOrganic farming, while serving a profitable market niche, promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. The practice requires more intensive manual labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and soil fertilization without chemical assistance. Crop losses tend to be higher than conventional farming, and small organic operations lack the economies of scale of larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, further increase labor costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, comprising chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjoins the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls face potential listing.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, and research was conducted on available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural development of this land.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond becomes apparent, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions that stem from brotherly bonds means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not just a reflection of themselves as others perceive them, but their true essence. Their genuine character is revealed through their actions and the resulting consequences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, set against a richly detailed landscape. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to a tragic end where only one survives. The story's themes unfold through the detailed portrayal of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective illuminates the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle to their final tragic encounter, he harbors a mix of resentment and ambition. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures - swimming, running, climbing - and become his companion in childhood exploits. These aspirations were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests in dark thoughts, even contemplating harming his infant brother, though these thoughts dissipate when touched by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath his complex emotions, suggesting that his initial harsh feelings were overshadowed by a deeper brotherly affection.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and creative information processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. People first compared it to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, later to books, and most recently to computers. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, and light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain processes sensory information repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change distinctly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate object recognition. In this case, top-down processing might help you identify the object as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage is essential for brain processing. Multiple memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information must first be encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through specific protein structures.\n\nVarious models explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, or neurophysiological findings. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. The effects of this recession continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) faced pressure to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, when he sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes reported in The New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes presciently warned that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue operation similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn. His prediction would prove accurate as these lending practices contributed to the economic collapse.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years created deep interconnections between various economic sectors and the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical writing. Or more likely, it's where your readers doze off or click away while muttering curses about you. Dr. Merlin often finds herself yelling at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers know the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like that troublesome voice in your head suggesting you should rush through the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other nagging voice pushing you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially explaining events to your audience through straightforward narrative. In movies, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. In written fiction, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about the heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife. You'd expect to see how his presence transformed and enriched her life through various demonstrations (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection and understand the heroine better: her attractions, their bond's depth, her perspectives and aspirations as seen through his eyes. This way, readers would truly feel her loss when he dies.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic storyline beyond just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs an author, it's your job to add these layers of detail. Sometimes you might be tempted to rush through certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know their complete background - former Air Force, current night manager at a gas station, twice married, childless, weekend fishing enthusiast, dreams of owning the station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story covered an incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. While his wife's name wasn't disclosed, they showed his mugshot, which portrayed a truly menacing appearance. The developing story received about two minutes of coverage, only revealing that he had stabbed his wife multiple times and was in custody. The coverage time seemed appropriate.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no arrests or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was conducting the investigation. The brevity of this coverage appeared potentially linked to racial bias, as the victim was African American. I've observed over the years that crime coverage involving minority victims tends to be minimal, while crimes against white victims, especially in cases of kidnapping or missing persons, receive extensive media attention.\n\nThey then covered a story about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report detailed the suspected location of the incident and confirmed it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather report followed, forecasting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. Though brief, this segment seemed designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported on a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a tall, dark-skinned Black man in a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds. The coverage seemed to place undue emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, perhaps for dramatic effect. The unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed irrelevant to the story's substance.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase in single-share increments. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs generally maintain lower expense ratios compared to typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay trading commissions like regular stocks. ETFs also offer investors access to a wide range of fund options.\n\nWhile these advantages are well-documented, prudent investors should carefully evaluate whether claimed benefits, particularly diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. This analysis focuses on examining the ETF IHF by comparing it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. To assess how effectively these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated their respective contributions to portfolio Beta and returns, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations reveal that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculated and normalized the standard deviation of each top 10 stock to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline. The arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The end of the fall semester in December brought increased workloads with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these demands. Furthermore, December's holiday season and the extended break meant many students and faculty weren't on campus at all. While the late January restart of classes might explain that month's low participation, the February numbers remain puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is addressing people's deep-seated attachment to the convenience and independence of personal vehicles - a core aspect of our culture. To encourage participation, we offered various incentives including gift certificates to local establishments like restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers. In retrospect, we wonder if larger prizes - such as a premium bicycle or even an electric or hybrid vehicle - might have sustained higher engagement levels. Our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, but a progressive increase in prize value might have helped maintain interest. While the initial gift cards proved adequate, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps an eco-friendly vehicle in January could have reversed the declining participation trend instead of watching it continue downward.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I examined all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films, while also noting the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. During this period, trick films generally followed certain conventions: they were filmed on sets, presented through a frontal theatrical view, featured static cameras, utilized long and medium shots, and adhered to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early 1900s began challenging these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films was their interior set filming within a front-facing theatrical frame. The camera remained stationary in its proscenium position, never following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly in vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. This stage-based approach meant that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining fixed even when they exit the frame.\n\nThis theatrical composition style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-ups, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following theatrical conventions, performers generally stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera closely enough to create close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a simple formula: one apparent shot constituted the entire film. This resulted in brief productions, typically lasting a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This format limited narrative possibilities, with most films focusing on short vaudeville-style illusions like magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as a single shot to viewers often comprised multiple physical shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot with the \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears continuous to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel represents a paradoxical blend of old and new elements, as Ian Watt notes in his work on the genre's rise. This literary form has experienced varied reception - from harsh criticism to high praise, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrated its ability to evoke what Burke called the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first true Gothic novel, masterfully combined elements from both ancient and modern romantic traditions to establish the foundational framework of the Gothic genre. Walpole integrated classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques that aimed to mirror natural life, creating what he termed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural traditions. By the time Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already acquired multiple meanings, referring to various peoples, artistic styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of being outdated or primitive compared to \"modern\" social and literary developments. However, the unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's intimate psychological perspective has allowed the genre to maintain its relevance while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most significant medieval concepts preserved in Gothic literature. In The Castle of Otranto, traditional chivalric ideals - the training and conduct of knights - are both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal of bravery, honor, and competence they found lacking in their contemporary society. Through the lens of chivalric traditions, the Gothic past becomes idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the later development of the Romantic movement and serving as a mirror to critique present society.\n\nWalpole wrote during a politically turbulent period, harboring concerns about the future. His involvement in politics and experience with controversial accusations may have led him to believe that the moral integrity and inherent goodness associated with the Gothic era had diminished in his contemporary society. This perspective is evident in his characterization of various figures, particularly Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric qualities. The character is portrayed with classical knightly attributes - as a prince who has endured hardship and tragedy, supposedly martyred by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is intentionally exaggerated, establishing the Gothic tradition of excess that would become characteristic of the genre.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nA supply chain consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain process, serves as its foundation. This stage determines the what, when, where, and how of production. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of consumer demands. Once they grasp these demands, managers can make informed decisions about product selection and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves workload scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. Every detail in this stage is crucial, as oversights can result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving procedures, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine which division best suits each production process, sometimes opting to outsource work to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocratic class of the era. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this tradition. Both works employ elements of mystery and unusual characteristics that were uncommon in novels of that period, yet these features serve to strengthen the character development, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"At that moment, countless bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing angrily: their words still echoing in his ears; when he regained consciousness... he found himself talking to them.... Suddenly, gunshots rang out, making him jump back; loud shouts and cries filled the air; lights flickered before his eyes, and everything descended into chaos and tumult, as if an invisible hand was hastily carrying him away. Throughout these rapidly appearing visions, there remained a vague, unsettling sense of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n\nThese two novels frequently create mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his awareness of the true nature of events unfolding around him.",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something struck me as unusual: his problems were quite peculiar. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't manage at all, which was very strange. Though I knew he was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English. We continued struggling until I met his mother. While I was watching over a few students who didn't go on a field trip, his mother came in. She couldn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read fine; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a major hurdle. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these alone can solve the problem. The key lies in combining all these approaches!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear this approach wastes resources and won't benefit the majority of students, that's incorrect. If we implement these programs as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we accomplish this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aides or tutors.",
            "From childhood, most of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, while some search for answers within themselves. Many readily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these notions, denying anything beyond their self-centered universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the darkness, hoping it will guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while listening to rain drumming on the tin roof. Water cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his look both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair had become thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt lonely and afraid, unable to tell my father how much I would miss him, knowing that speaking of it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, only extending his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't understand the value of this when it merely prolonged his pain. I asked myself what kind of God would do this. Alone in the night, I stopped praying. I thought if God existed, He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch him transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the end of the life that had created me. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator to his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held strong convictions about natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function justly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended creating a society based on common good and instead formed sub-societies thriving at others' expense. Good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored an extremely limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. With detached precision and practiced observation, I studied what lay before my eyes, deliberately avoiding any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed to operate independently of personal reflection, simply experiencing what I observed.\n\nFollowing an artist's recommendation, I had once purchased \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to master drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to complex neural processing of visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around the subject matter. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into manageable compositions - simply a bowl on a surface.\n\nYet now, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that artistic framing technique. The sight left me too stunned, too overwhelmed for anything but silent amazement. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here before me - if I dared call it art - was the beginning of my own masterpiece: A Study in Brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, my intentions manifesting in what could have been my greatest creative moment. Water swirled peacefully, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the handle again, but the brown mass remained stubbornly fixed to the toilet bowl's bottom, like an immovable slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at this unwelcome gift someone had left for the unfortunate bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After several more flushes and moments of philosophical contemplation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled a makeshift glove. Then, straightening up before bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, not unlike a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young lives are being lost in traffic accidents. Multiple factors contribute to these alarming statistics among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is that the teenage brain isn't physiologically prepared for driving's challenges. Lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads to higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road crashes.\n\nThe situation becomes even more dangerous when teens drive with their peers—something that happens frequently, as anyone would expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile California and other states have implemented provisional licensing systems that restrict driving hours and passenger numbers for teen drivers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains: statistically, the youngest drivers simply cannot adequately manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for full driving privileges, citing research published in USA Today that shows individuals under 19-20 often seek thrills purely for the sensation. This suggests that delaying driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes would be prudent. If we maintain current licensing practices, we face not only continued fatalities but potentially devastating numbers in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nA legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. The system would still include provisional permits and required training hours, based on existing state requirements (such as California's 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Given that teen driving statistics are problematic nationwide, uniform federal legislation could effectively protect young people across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't revolutionary—it's a practical response to a documented problem.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics or warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing abilities, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in childhood CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds in space, problems distinguishing between different sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking where one sound blocks another, difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequencing auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic methods often involve multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements.",
            "In pursuing a career in social work, I aim to work with the Division of Family and Children Services to support abused or neglected children and assist troubled families. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values are not merely professional requirements but deeply personal convictions.\n\nInitially, while I knew I wanted to help others, my career direction wasn't clear. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. After speaking with both the police and the parents, who dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes,\" I found my calling in social work.\n\nSocial justice stands as another crucial value in social work. Our society claims to value individuality while paradoxically promoting conformity. I've always challenged this contradiction, expressing my individuality through various forms of personal expression - from unconventional hair colors to multiple ear piercings. I've actively supported the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistently opposed racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and explains selected research to better illustrate each model. The research findings are then evaluated for their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental conditions, and sleep disorders related to other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining or achieving adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias concern sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental conditions stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic factors, hereditary elements, and physiological aspects. Research shows that hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically control sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration. These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating both genetic and environmental influences on human GABAB receptors. Receptor dysfunction could affect natural sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited phenotypes affecting these receptors could impact sleep regulation, potentially disrupting daily activities, academic performance, career success, and tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Getting around campus is a challenge for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, which is practically at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during State College's frequently unfavorable weather.\n\nA conversation with a recent alumnus revealed that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have been filled with athletic fields, major new structures including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone aren't the answer – students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nRecently, I spoke with a friend who had just returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic. There was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many upperclassmen, I now live off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bike, I can make this journey in just 5 minutes when riding quickly. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, can be challenging to navigate, whether on foot or by bike. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule doesn't allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine – that's over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats posed by technology and capitalistic structures through his creation of a dystopian society. In this world, communal values supersede individual identity, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist theoretical framework, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel's frequent use of Marxist concepts such as homogenization and reification reinforces its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economic system of Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general population is prevented from understanding their true economic relationship with other classes, as they are programmed to focus solely on personal satisfaction. This results from ideological control of the working class, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning programs in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller through hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a ruling elite. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates their own oppression. While upper classes are born with the potential for awareness, few besides characters like Bernard choose to question their prescribed roles. The interactions between social classes serve as powerful illustrations of capitalism's perceived oppressive nature.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack individual depth - possibly Huxley's commentary on how the convergence of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its autonomy and expressiveness. Love is nonexistent, and emotional extremes are suppressed; interactions remain superficial, evidenced by men's focus on women's physical attributes (their \"pneumatic\" qualities) and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further demonstrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their own importance as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal expectations.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I believe this question is even more pertinent today. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed mainstream media shift from an antagonistic view of Islam and extremists to an almost excessive tolerance of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have seemed impossible to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family history.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure, misunderstood yet humble, with people gradually recognizing the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nI've noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived among miracles. This approach troubles me as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's unique miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly designed to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes the accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This image appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history broadly, we can observe Christianity gradually departing from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and resist any thinking beyond their learned boundaries, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical consciousness will greatly expand in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. While this may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in Christian historical trends. It will return to its original form. A growing movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message from God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through America and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as they would in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong in leading the way. However, as the theological clock reverses, Christianity's extreme diversity will transform into increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, rejected, and killed by the Roman Empire, yet later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal ahead will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its origins while eliminating diversity. Importantly, what will make this process possible is an approach to reading Jesus's words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. So what has transpired since Jesus's time? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. When Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, monotheism, the concept of divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally focus on their own wellbeing and advancement, often disregarding those beneath them. This theme manifests throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing profits, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair highlights the environmental devastation caused by unchecked industrialization. The owners show no concern for the harmful effects of their factories' pollution or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends to their workforce, whom they treat as disposable resources. As the text states, \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face brutal hours, arbitrary layoffs without notice, and no job security or compensation. In this era, the absence of labor laws and regulations allowed management to operate with impunity, forcing workers to maintain impossible productivity levels in dangerous conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown were essentially trapped in a system of modern slavery, with no recourse or support systems. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. As the novel points out, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. While Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain that Greeks considered the edge of the known world, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, as Poe had a strong interest in German literature.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems and concludes that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the tale of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he descends into heavy drinking and mourning for his departed queen. Deciding it's time to die, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The emotional state of the King of Thule bears striking resemblance to the king's description in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol. H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama in 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"",
            "Under California law, a customer's claim for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall incident involving an applesauce spill at a grocery store warrants careful consideration. The case centers on whether the store manager's conduct demonstrated malice by failing to address a reported hazard for thirty minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe judge is likely to allow Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim to proceed. To justify punitive damages in California, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can make a compelling argument that Manager Martin should have anticipated the dangers of an unattended spill, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered similar accidents in recent months. While the argument for \"despicable\" conduct may be less straightforward, it remains reasonable given the store's history of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's apparent indifference to safety protocols.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when employee Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Manager Paul Martin at 5:00 PM. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the concern, stating he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" A second employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the same hazard at 5:15 PM, receiving a similar dismissive response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer suffered a serious back injury after slipping on the unremedied spill. This incident followed five previous slip-and-fall accidents at D&D Markets that same year.\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded in non-contractual cases where the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful acts or \"despicable\" behavior showing willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. California courts have interpreted malicious conduct to include situations where defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet deliberately failed to prevent them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt an inexplicable emptiness within her, a yearning that couldn't be satisfied. This feeling first emerged when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. Eventually, she realized what she craved wasn't something, but someone. Yet strangely, she felt no attraction to any boys. Though some had shown interest in her, awkwardly attempting to court the uncourt-able, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, perpetually puzzled by her own desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed individuals who rarely argued, either with each other or with their daughter. The only occasional conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Born to this serene couple, she provided a striking contrast with her vibrant, outgoing personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her widely likeable.\n\nHowever, this particular day was anything but peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, breathing heavily and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her mother, she reached out to help. Between labored breaths, her mother managed, \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Grateful for her strength training, she carefully followed her mother's instructions on how to lift her, carried her to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital visit brought its typical mix of antiseptic smells and anxiety, though she barely noticed, focused entirely on her mother's wellbeing. She carried her mother in, urgently calling for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly responded, transferring her mother onto a gurney and whisking her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait in worried suspense.\n\nThe incident had occurred when her mother fell from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research established a negative correlation between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women aged 38-63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were designated as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study controlled for confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and CHD and stroke risk, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed diet scores, was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, researchers documented 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "According to the sign, Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation that has been under the control of a militant dictatorship since their 1962 coup d'état. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led by Buddhist monks, became known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of their traditional robes. While the protests initially started small, they soon gained widespread public support. Though the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation quickly deteriorated into what many described as open warfare between the monastery and military, with forces raiding temples nationwide. Foreign journalists faced immediate arrest, and on September 27th, 2007, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai was killed simply for documenting a protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed that \"The actual death toll reaches several thousand - far more than reported.\"\n\nThis pattern of oppression is nothing new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors being viewed as living gods, to modern-day political dynamics involving figures like President George W. Bush and his associations with religious conservative leaders, the struggle for power persists.\n\nNotable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where students, intellectuals, and workers gathered to challenge government authority. Death toll estimates vary dramatically - from the government's claim of 200-300 to the Chinese Red Cross's estimate of 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, which spanned multiple years and countries, represents another extreme case of systematic persecution, specifically targeting Jewish populations for extermination.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original sounds tailored to each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and brilliant works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative approach, Creole Love Call is noted for its pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" - a technique he would employ throughout his career. This piece exemplifies Ellington's early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while also demonstrating his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. This measured, twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that transition to a rougher texture.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the core melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: An expansive clarinet solo in upper register, supported by subtle syncopated piano.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its peak as reeds initiate the call and response in high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the original format, featuring voice-reed dialogue with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nEnding: A short tag featuring a vocal run and an unconventional dissonant trombone conclusion.\n\nThis innovative use of voice as a tonal element became a hallmark of Ellington's style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This approach evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody with remarkable effect.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in specific ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson stated in 1917 that \"even now, zoologists have barely begun to define the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" this observation remains relevant today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms controlling the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns, called whorls, rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis, running through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate of whorl expansion can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described as follows: First, view the shell from above and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal secretes (builds) its shell. The aperture's path can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well toward many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be examined below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has improved its rate of births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the progress shown by this indicator is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still necessary. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional healthcare treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low rates observed nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system. While vertical, program-specific approaches are appealing due to their focused objectives and quick results, they have notable drawbacks. These include the potential diversion of resources and personnel from other health sectors (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services) and the inefficient duplication of services across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved so extensively over the past century that it now encompasses countless genres, making it nearly impossible to compile a complete list. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and even further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit often leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, we've reached a point where the sheer number of niches makes it challenging to define exactly what heavy metal is. While it has incorporated numerous elements from other genres, like everything else, it has its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend the metal music that pervades our world today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just another genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be understood as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It favors technical proficiency over primitivism; metal musicians are notably skilled at their instruments, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental mindsets, resulting in the creation of otherworldly records, with drugs often serving as both inspiration and scapegoat. The movement embodies many dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, as much of popular music had traditionally shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent in the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" not only depicts a woman mesmerized by the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, though this pursuit presented him with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and unique artistic voice.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a moderately prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight of their infant children, left Rousseau with just one surviving daughter, Julia, and overwhelming grief. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasant life in their works, Rousseau remained essentially a folk artist, expressing the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside numerous accomplished and well-established modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. As Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, had fundamentally different motivations: while Matisse strived to avoid conventional painting at all costs, Rousseau's greatest desire was to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life comes through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of goodness or beauty. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite artwork or literary piece, people often preface their detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe neither art nor morality can be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our most complete descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature creates a bridge between them.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful unified nation, with a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This same cultural thread weaves through Cologne along the Rhine, across Germany's heartland, to Dresden, the Saxon city on the Elbe River. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first introduced the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, adopting it from the Gauls to differentiate between his conquered territories and the unconquered lands. While the name's true origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to \"neighbor\" in Gallic, while others connect it to the Germanic spear called \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, writing in 98 AD, portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other races. He questioned why anyone would choose Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate over the comforts of Asia, Africa, or Italy, unless it was their homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves were initially reluctant to settle in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading local goods and offering their military service to the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can be an effective tool for sustained deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their true selves permanently. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, as it may lead to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take grave offense at the masquerade.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such acts. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes more complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino, who believes her to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that surface through their interactions with Viola/Cesario. However, rather than suggesting Olivia has latent same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely uses her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest, as shown in her declaration: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "Various observers have noted the brutality of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, it would be overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad description. The German colonial empire exhibited diverse policies and governing styles across its various territories. Educational systems also varied significantly among the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established public schools and actively participated in native education, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary organizations with minimal government support. However, the government invested considerably in European education within the colony, establishing state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools serving Europeans. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies produced significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated, untouched, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's distinct experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding settler and colonial authority attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing colonial educational systems. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the two colonies' educational systems and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many of its distinctive educational characteristics.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 white residents.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple confrontations occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The conflict originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent countries. As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only nations presenting persistent, comprehensive diplomatic challenges for America. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these rivalrous relationships, while other Latin American nations have maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) observes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, although I dreamed of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing instead.\n\nHowever, there I was: 46, single, with barely any savings, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know is true: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too big to overcome alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being considered the most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five centuries; its present form differs significantly from how it existed during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal forces, whether hostile or benign.\n\nThis discussion employs several qualifying terms. The first distinction is between internal and external forces. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those coming from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks must adhere to many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First is Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."
