            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial element in any negotiation process. Rather than being defined solely by what it is, culture can often be better understood by what it is not. Culture is neither uniform nor concrete - it's a complex, multifaceted concept. Making broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplifies reality. While cultural generalizations can provide useful context, negotiators benefit more from understanding how specific cultural elements influence the matter at hand and shape negotiation dynamics. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally interpret it through the lens of their own cultural experience, drawing inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires comprehensive effort, from studying its historical background to recognizing its inherent biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to modify cultural practices, one should accept them as they are and work within cultural parameters, particularly during negotiations - especially when operating from a position of lesser leverage. When negotiating in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and facilitate productive dialogue.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Organizations within the same country often develop distinct corporate cultures. These might manifest in various ways, such as expectations about working hours or workplace flexibility. Corporate culture becomes visible through dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), leadership approaches, and recruitment policies. Some organizations actively promote charitable giving among employees, while others limit it to company-sanctioned initiatives. The diversity of American corporate cultures - even within the same company across different locations and settings - demonstrates how varied cultural expression can be within a broader societal framework. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous to outsiders, such uniformity often masks deeper complexities.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is particularly crucial as they explain the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize maintaining face or group harmony, negotiators are unlikely to risk public embarrassment of their organization or leadership to achieve negotiation goals. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may not rush to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts on a personal level to enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Thomas Aquinas appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is superior, we must, for the sake of conciseness, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. To consider a divine figure different from the one these authors believe in would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid points, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path to understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, when expressed in his terminology, is somewhat lengthy and occasionally unclear, its core message is that the proof of God resides within the human mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, the reality of this being can be discovered simply by examining the inherent truths within our minds. External evidence appears unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective differs significantly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith whatsoever. This approach would be valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable claims. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas elaborates on five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each argument, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and completing the rest of the puzzle – logic dictates that you can know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. At times, Fitzgerald creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. In other instances, he assigns symbolic meanings to elements and employs them for similar purposes. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops specific meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically uses these associations to evoke certain emotional responses in readers when encountering important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald constructs for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel through repeated use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" party guests become \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is merely \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all emphasizing uniformity and conformity.",
            "San Diego County enjoys remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches, lemons, various berries, honey, and peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products are particularly sought after. Many organic farms offer educational tours of their operations and provide access for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tours, and generating income through educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming not only serves a profitable market niche but also promotes greater biodiversity in local flora and fauna, largely due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming presents its own challenges, including higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements for pest control, weed management, and natural fertilization, and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional methods. Smaller organic operations also lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, can further increase operational costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, which adjoins the Cleveland National Forest, consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially threatened species like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. This case study examined a real property listing and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small farmers interested in balancing operational costs with wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model for potential achievement.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond—whether positive or negative—becomes most apparent. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences. Understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not how others perceive them, but their true selves reflected back.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship between two brothers against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to tragic consequences. The story's themes unfold through the characterization of Doodle and the narrator's perspective, revealing complex emotional dynamics that drive their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle until their final tragic encounter, the protagonist harbors mixed feelings of resentment and hope. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures—swimming, running, climbing trees in Old Woman Swamp, racing to Horsehead Landing, and sitting high in the pine trees behind the barn. These dreams were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests dramatically, even leading to dark thoughts of infanticide, yet these thoughts dissolve when Doodle simply smiles at him. This simple gesture reveals the underlying love that exists beneath the surface of their complicated relationship, showing that even in his darkest moments, the protagonist's brotherly affection remains intact.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. Throughout history, as technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, the metaphors used to understand the brain evolved accordingly - from comparisons to wax tablets, to papyrus sheets, to books, and eventually to computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons are converted into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. Consider viewing a black box against a white background: bottom-up processing combines basic elements like color, orientation, and edge detection to form the image of a box, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance recognition, helping distinguish whether it's a solid black box or a box-shaped void in the white surface.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filter to determine the significance of processed information and direct it to appropriate cognitive functions. While your brain processes all visual input, such as individual grass blades when looking at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents information overload. Conversely, certain stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded room, may break through this filter. Information undergoes multiple processing stages, continuously modified by attention mechanisms.\n\nInformation storage is fundamental to brain processing, occurring through various memory systems including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information encoding varies by sensory type - for instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Memory maintenance differs by type: working memory, lasting about 20 seconds, appears to involve electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits, while long-term memory is believed to be preserved in protein structures.\n\nVarious models exist to explain knowledge organization in the brain, derived from memory retrieval studies, computer science principles, and neurophysiological research. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, the concept \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating a web of related ideas.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. As we continue to feel the effects of this recession today, we must examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks found themselves short on reserves, causing a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times presciently reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years further entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets in housing-related investments, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's transformation into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your writing where you spread your creative wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical prose. Or more likely, it's the part where your readers doze off or click away in frustration, silently cursing your name. Even Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like a mischievous imp on your shoulder, whispering that you should quickly dispense with the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other imp urging you to share every minute detail of each character's upbringing).\n\nExposition is essentially narrating events to your audience in straightforward prose. In films, it manifests when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about a heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions his deep love for his wife. Similarly, you'd expect to see how the heroine's life was transformed and enriched by his presence through various significant and subtle details (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection with his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: her attractions, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through his perspective. This way, readers would truly share in her grief at his death, forming a stronger connection with the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic skeleton of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. While it might be tempting to rush through certain elements - like introducing a new character with a rapid-fire list of facts about their Air Force background, current job as a gas station night manager, two marriages, childless status, fishing hobby, secret ambitions of ownership, and breakfast preferences - this approach rarely serves the story well.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The primary story on NBC 4's live morning broadcast (August 13, 2011) covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife multiple times. While showing his mugshot, which portrayed a menacing appearance, they spent about two minutes on this developing story, providing basic details about his arrest.\n\nThe second report concerned an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no suspects or arrests at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. The brevity of this coverage seemed potentially linked to racial bias, as I've observed that crimes against minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThey then reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as coming from a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s. This shorter segment appeared designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nA story about a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus followed, with what seemed like disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description of the six-foot-tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie.\n\nThe final story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of marijuana distribution to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, and made what appeared to be an unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. ETFs also offer the advantage of wide selection across various fund types. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always analyze whether claimed advantages like diversification are genuine and to what extent they exist.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nGiven the impracticality of analyzing every holding, we've focused on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The analysis includes their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations are shown in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% increase) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings might offer superior returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance of these differences, we calculated the standard deviation for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline: the arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. Additionally, December coincides with the fall semester's end, when the community is overwhelmed with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these pressures. The holiday season and subsequent extended break for students and faculty also meant reduced campus presence. When classes resumed in late January, participation remained low, and February's numbers were particularly puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted participation for that month. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is confronting the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To overcome this, incentivization proved crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates for local businesses - restaurants, cafes, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers - we later wondered if more substantial rewards might have yielded better results. The possibility of winning major prizes like a new bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car could have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Our incentive structure remained relatively static throughout the project; implementing an escalating prize value system - starting with gift cards and progressing to more significant rewards like bicycles and ultimately a hybrid or electric vehicle - might have maintained or even increased engagement levels rather than allowing them to drop.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the common poetic elements across most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics found in several later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking common feature among these trick films was their indoor set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its proscenium position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-based approach was that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining static even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from Edison's trick films catalog, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following standard early film practices, actors remained in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a one-shot-equals-one-film format, typically resulting in films lasting about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint limited their dramatic and narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style illusions such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears as one continuous shot to casual viewers.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and nomenclature, a paradoxical rhetoric of \"old-new,\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both criticism and praise, being denounced for lacking genuine depth while simultaneously celebrated for evoking what Burke called \"the terrible sublime.\" The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romance to create the prototype of the Gothic genre and establish a new form of literary expression.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. In the face of \"modern\" social and literary \"advancement,\" it was considered antiquated or unsophisticated. However, the fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format (which allowed readers more intimate access to character psychology) enabled Gothic literature to endure and appear simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original writing period.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most prominent Gothic concepts present in Gothic novels. The medieval notion of chivalry, the process of cultivating a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held particular significance for Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and what these writers (especially Walpole) perceived as its absence in contemporary society. Through the employment of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (suggesting the genre's eventual evolution toward Romanticism) and serves as a tool for attempting to improve the present.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to reach the end customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nSupply chain management consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundational first step in the supply chain process. It determines the when, why, where, and how of all production activities. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of customer demand. Once management comprehends market demands, they can make decisions about product types and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations, considering factors like plant capacity, quality capabilities, and alignment with customer satisfaction goals. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The production phase is crucial, and attention to detail is essential, as oversights can result in significant time and financial costs. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed procedures for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and determining appropriate outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period's aristocratic society. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand out as two Victorian novels that deviate from this tradition. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and unusual occurrences, which is uncommon for novels of that era, but this approach serves to strengthen their character development by providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"And now, a flood of confusing and perplexing thoughts invaded his mind. He felt as though he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit during their heated argument - their very words echoing in his ears. When he managed to regain his awareness, he discovered he was speaking to them. Without warning, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything became chaos and confusion as some invisible force hastily pulled him away. Throughout these swift visions, there remained a vague, persistent awareness of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two novels frequently employ mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their purpose and content differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver experiences the event vividly in a dream-like state while seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness over these events and his deteriorating health, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him completely, numbing his senses to the point where he fails to notice the \"invisible force\" carrying him away. He relives his despair without the initial shock of pain, as the pain has become a constant companion to his fear rather than a surprise. Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about whose will directed his misfortune, as it clearly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces Oliver's lack of control, showing how he cannot even attempt to influence events even when his life hangs in the balance. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one would expect Oliver to make some effort, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n\"The day passed - day? There was no day; it vanished as quickly as it came - and night descended once again; a night so endless yet so brief; long in its terrible silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something seemed off about his situation: his difficulties were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while completely struggling with others, which was peculiar. Though clearly of Latino descent, he spoke English fluently. We continued to work together until I met his mother. While I was watching a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip, his mother came in. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was still learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read just fine; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can be a major hurdle. While we can all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the fix was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these approaches alone can solve this issue. The key lies in combining all these methods!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, this is incorrect. If we implement these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aids or tutors in our schools.",
            "From our earliest childhood, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some seek understanding through Sunday school, others through Temple, while many search for answers within themselves. Many accept the religious traditions handed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, refusing to believe in anything beyond their own personal universe. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to later replace it with another. Regardless of our chosen path, we all journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for light to guide us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat together on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while rain drummed against the tin roof above us. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze drifted into the rain, part searching, part remembering. His body had grown thinner lately, clothes hanging loose, his hair noticeably thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him - speaking about it would only make it more real for us both. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. Though chemotherapy and radiation extended his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they didn't ease his suffering - I questioned the value of prolonging his pain. I struggled with faith, wondering what kind of God would allow this. In my solitary nights, I offered no prayers, believing that if God existed, He had long since stopped listening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final transition from this life. I chose not to be present, wanting to preserve memories of how he lived rather than how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and understood he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man renowned for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held a strong conviction in natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended the creation of a society based on public good and led to the formation of sub-societies thriving at others' expense. A good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blank as I took in the scene before me. With practiced detachment, I observed silently, my mind analyzing what lay before my eyes without connecting it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts came and went, fleeting like shadows. My consciousness worked with such clarity that it seemed I wasn't thinking at all, but rather experiencing a fluid awareness of what I saw.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I had longed to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to understanding how the brain processes visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around whatever you wish to study. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into simpler elements: just the bowl on a plane.\n\nIn that moment, looking down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was too overwhelmed, too stunned to do anything but stare in amazement. Just as Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, if I were to claim any artistic perspective, this would be my beginning - my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, my intentions taking physical form in what could have been my most creative moment. The water swirled peacefully, crystal clear. Particles broke free and disappeared into nothingness. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, like a reluctant slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at the crude deposit someone had left as a challenge for the Rite Aid bathroom cleaners. After several more flushes and moments of contemplation, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping layer upon layer until it resembled a protective mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, much like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are losing their lives on the roads. Multiple factors contribute to this deadly statistical trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not developed enough to handle the dangers of driving. Basic lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and road departures.\n\nTeenagers face even greater risks when traveling with peers—something that anyone with common sense knows happens frequently. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident rates.\n\nWhile California and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety through provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains that statistically, the youngest drivers as a group simply cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 commonly seek thrills purely for the sensation. Therefore, it makes sense to postpone driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. If we maintain current licensing practices for young teens, we'll not only continue to see fatal accidents but likely witness a dramatic surge in deaths in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nThe legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. A provisional license system could remain in place before full licensing, along with required practical training hours based on existing state standards (such as California's requirement of 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, national uniform legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting young people nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics and warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first identified in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds, problems distinguishing between different acoustic events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking (where one sound blocks another), difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and specialized auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. While there is currently no standardized diagnostic tool or known cause, testing often involves evaluating responses to multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and may include advanced acoustic measurements.",
            "In pursuing a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values aren't merely professional requirements – they're deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though initially, I was uncertain about my career direction. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the police's request, noting how they nervously dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, particularly to help children facing family challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that resonates deeply with me. While our society claims to value individuality and mourns lost lives, we often pressure people to conform to traditional norms. I've always challenged social injustice, expressing my individuality through unconventional hair colors, personal style choices, multiple ear piercings, and active participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I've consistently stood against racism and discrimination whenever I've encountered it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I will continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model examines inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model investigates environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models of insomnia and explains the selected research to better illustrate these models. The research and its findings are then critically analyzed to highlight their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders, or sleep disorders related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include sleep-wake disorders or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other types of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance intake.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic, hereditary, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors exist on orexin neurons, specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep-promoting responses. When its firing is inhibited, this can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for approximately two and a half years, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dormitory in East Halls, which is essentially at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building near campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nIn conversation with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed with athletic fields, major new facilities including the new Creamery and health services building, and are now surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a university campus, the bicycle proves to be the best answer. However, bicycles alone aren't the complete solution - students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He expressed surprise at having ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduate students, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dormitories. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas Building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this journey to just 5 minutes when riding at a good pace. The only challenge is that while Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, it isn't always easily navigable, whether on bike or foot. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for that option. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable means of reaching classes. Walking to Thomas Building daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalist structures through his creation of a dystopian society. The novel portrays a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and where citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a grand scheme, confined within an ideological framework dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist lens, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification, reinforcing its position as a commentary on the economic systems emerging in Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein the general population remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on their personal gains. This ignorance stems from ideological control of the working classes, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning methods in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. The World Controller manipulates this system through hegemony, where one group completely dominates other social classes. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. While upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most Alphas and Betas, with few exceptions like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nMeaningful interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack psychological depth - perhaps Huxley's commentary on how the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its authenticity and free expression. True love is non-existent, and emotional extremes are suppressed. Instead, interactions remain superficial, with men focusing on women's physical attributes (described as \"pneumatic\"), and women openly discussing their casual encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further illustrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and maintain their position alongside their peers.",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in our class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed how mass media has shifted from initially viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to now displaying an almost excessive tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has clear Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it appears to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure who was misunderstood and showed humility, with people gradually discovering the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' A notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived surrounded by truth and miracles. This approach seems problematic as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly intended to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, these stories often rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes these accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This characterization appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history from a broader perspective, we can observe Christianity gradually moving away from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be significant enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will greatly increase in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines that were added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. It will return to its original form. A movement will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message to humanity on behalf of God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as if they were living in Jesus's time and following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the extreme diversification in Christianity will reverse toward greater uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see increasing similarities. Human history is full of great reversals - consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution, or how our country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal in our future will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified but divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally prioritize their own interests and well-being, often disregarding those beneath them in social standing. The novel demonstrates this through various examples, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing their success, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair illustrates the devastating environmental impact of industrial pollution. The owners show no concern for the harm caused by their factories' emissions or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe treatment of workers further exemplifies this callousness. As the text notes, \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, brutal working hours, and dangerous conditions, with no job security or protection. During this period, the absence of labor laws left workers vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nWhile never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these deplorable conditions both at work and in their living environments. The lack of support systems or legitimate workers' organizations left them trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. The situation was so dire that workers were effectively reduced to slaves, as described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finest poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary source worth noting. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he turns to heavy drinking and weeps for his departed queen. Eventually, he decides it's time for his own death, bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" bear striking similarities, perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and struggles with alcohol. In 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on spilled applesauce in a grocery store might be eligible for punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager acted maliciously by failing to clean up a spill for 30 minutes after being notified twice, as he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of an uncleaned spill, given that multiple D&D customers had previously been injured from slipping. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's failure to maintain store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on his dinner break, claimed he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. That year, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety. California courts have found malicious conduct when defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet willfully and deliberately failed to avoid them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something missing in her life - an unfulfillable longing that began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. Now at 17, that feeling persisted. She had come to realize that what she yearned for was someone rather than something, yet she found herself strangely uninterested in boys. Though some had been drawn to her, attempting awkwardly to court the un-courtable, none had captured her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. And so she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nHome life was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to this serene couple, she balanced their calm energy with her vibrant and fun-loving personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite endearing to others.\n\nBut today was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panicked, crying out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, wincing in pain and letting out short, pained breaths. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out to help. \"Ouch... honey, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. The daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for the strength-training classes she had taken. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with fear. But she noticed none of this, her mind focused solely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around as someone quickly brought a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while reducing animal products and saturated fats consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study also demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically addressed stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38-63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These participants were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which followed 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random variations and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet (indicated by higher aMed scores) was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed score quintile showed significantly lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives on in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the actress known for \"Juno,\" stands solitary at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after their traditional robes' color. As public participation grew, the government's initial tolerance of peaceful monastic gatherings gave way to escalating violence, eventually developing into what many viewed as open warfare between the monks and military regime. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, while foreign journalists faced immediate arrest. One such journalist, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for documenting a protest. Though official records cite only 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed, \"The true death toll reaches thousands, far beyond what's been reported.\"\n\nSuch oppression isn't unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule absolutely. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings themselves, while in modern times, President George W. Bush reportedly maintains close ties with religious conservative leadership.\n\nHistory offers stark examples of such authoritarian violence: the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000; the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates; and the Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jews across multiple nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his extraordinary ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original soundscapes for each composition. His profound understanding of each player's sound and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking masterpieces.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's innovative approach is exemplified in Creole Love Call, notably for his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece demonstrates his early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait that defined his entire career. This measured twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nFirst Chorus: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that grow rougher toward the end.\nSecond Chorus: A muted trumpet solo elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes.\nThird Chorus: An expansive high-register clarinet solo backed by subtle syncopated piano.\nFourth Chorus: Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nFifth Chorus: The piece's climax, featuring high-register reeds initiating call and response, supported by syncopated brass and rhythm sections.\nSixth Chorus: Returns to the original format, with voice and reeds in dialogue, the voice adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique.\nEnding: A brief conclusion featuring a vocal run and distinctive dissonant trombone finish.\n\nThis vocal approach to tonal coloring became a signature element throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This concept evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone brilliantly introduces the melody, exemplifying Ellington's innovative orchestration.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in their particular ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"zoologists have barely begun to express even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms,\" this observation remains relevant today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research examines how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns in a coiled shell are called whorls, which rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, and adjacent whorls are separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The shell's tip is called the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The standard way to orient a shell is in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nBelow is a method for counting whorls. First, examine the shell from above (apical view) and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The aperture's path can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis movement can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once expressed mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well towards many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be explored below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in increasing the presence of skilled health workers at births, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional medical treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low coverage rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating inequitable healthcare distribution across the country. Urban centers clearly have better access to healthcare services. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of society, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without specifically focusing on maternal and child pre- and post-pregnancy care. While program-specific \"vertical approaches\" are appealing due to their focused objectives and faster results, they have notable drawbacks. Such approaches often divert funding and human resources from other healthcare areas (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services). Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and poor coordination, resulting in increased administrative burden for supplies and funding management.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved tremendously over the last century, encompassing so many genres that a complete enumeration is nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit typically leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, there are so many specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become challenging. While it has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, like everything else, it has its origins. To properly comprehend the ubiquitous metal music of today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitive but more technically demanding; metal musicians demonstrate exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly experimental approaches, resulting in otherworldly recordings, with drugs often cited as the catalyst for such creative expression. It embodies many dark, visceral qualities, which was revolutionary in a music scene where popular music typically avoided the darker aspects of emotional expression. Additionally, subsequent generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities that were prominent during the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-inspired works, Henri Rousseau was already carefully crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, while grappling with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong struggle: whether to conform to established painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own distinctive path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed middle-class comfort. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the loss of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist who shared the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside many other accomplished and renowned modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. According to Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, differed fundamentally in their approach and motivation: while Matisse feared creating conventional art, Rousseau actively sought to paint in such a conventional manner that he would gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life is acquired through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often preface their more detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe both art and morality can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's properties, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this same quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature provides the connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kantian terminology. They affect us in a way that can be experienced but never fully explained. This connection becomes even stronger in literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is truly unique about it, is its moral quality. While moral standards might be inappropriate for other arts, such as music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values... Literature matters to us precisely because of the values we find within it.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, exhibiting a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This cultural continuity flows from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany's heartland, to the Elbe-situated Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural landscape, it's natural that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage the Gauls. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowing it from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. While the name's true origin remains unclear, some suggest it meant \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, while others connect it to the German spear (ger) or the Old Irish word \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nIn his 98 AD work \"On the Origin and Geography of Germania,\" Tacitus portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, untouched by foreign influence through migration or interaction. He noted the improbability of voluntary migration to Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate, suggesting only natives would choose such a homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves showed little interest in permanent settlement in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire's comforts. By the mid-first century, Germanic tribes established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as an effective tool for prolonged deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their authentic selves. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, potentially leading to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their true identity or maintaining their relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take great offense at the deception.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such masquerade. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes further complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, Twelfth Night can be interpreted as demonstrating how deception might catalyze the revelation of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest these characters harbor unexplored desires that Viola's presence as Cesario forces them to confront. However, rather than suggesting Olivia harbors same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely intended her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "German colonial rule was known for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, an entire colonial empire cannot be summarized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited diversity in both its policies and governing styles, much like its geographical spread. Education across the colonies showed similar variation. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated, literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) presented a striking contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in native education, in South West Africa, indigenous education was almost entirely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government made substantial investments in European settlers' education, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only countries where the United States faced persistent, long-term diplomatic challenges. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these tensions, while other Latin American nations maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) notes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by disability due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, despite dreaming of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46, single, virtually no savings, and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know for sure: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too big to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly existence and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being recognized as its most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five hundred years; its present form differs significantly from what it was during Buddha's time. These changes are evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nSeveral qualifying terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist order, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will appear repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical components. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Along with Samsara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will end when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial element in any negotiation process. Rather than being defined solely by what it is, culture can often be better understood by what it is not. Culture is neither uniform nor concrete - it's a complex, multifaceted concept. Making broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplifies reality. While cultural generalizations can provide useful context, negotiators benefit more from understanding how specific cultural elements influence the matter at hand and shape negotiation dynamics. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally interpret it through the lens of their own cultural experience, drawing inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires comprehensive effort, from studying its historical background to recognizing its inherent biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to modify cultural practices, one should accept them as they are and work within cultural parameters, particularly during negotiations - especially when operating from a position of lesser leverage. When negotiating in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and facilitate productive dialogue.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Organizations within the same country often develop distinct corporate cultures. These might manifest in various ways, such as expectations about working hours or workplace flexibility. Corporate culture becomes visible through dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), leadership approaches, and recruitment policies. Some organizations actively promote charitable giving among employees, while others limit it to company-sanctioned initiatives. The diversity of American corporate cultures - even within the same company across different locations and settings - demonstrates how varied cultural expression can be within a broader societal framework. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous to outsiders, such uniformity often masks deeper complexities.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is particularly crucial as they explain the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize maintaining face or group harmony, negotiators are unlikely to risk public embarrassment of their organization or leadership to achieve negotiation goals. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may not rush to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts on a personal level to enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Thomas Aquinas appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is superior, we must, for the sake of conciseness, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. To consider a divine figure different from the one these authors believe in would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid points, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path to understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, when expressed in his terminology, is somewhat lengthy and occasionally unclear, its core message is that the proof of God resides within the human mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, the reality of this being can be discovered simply by examining the inherent truths within our minds. External evidence appears unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective differs significantly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith whatsoever. This approach would be valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable claims. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas elaborates on five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each argument, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and completing the rest of the puzzle – logic dictates that you can know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. At times, Fitzgerald creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. In other instances, he assigns symbolic meanings to elements and employs them for similar purposes. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops specific meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically uses these associations to evoke certain emotional responses in readers when encountering important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald constructs for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel through repeated use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" party guests become \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is merely \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all emphasizing uniformity and conformity.",
            "San Diego County enjoys remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches, lemons, various berries, honey, and peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products are particularly sought after. Many organic farms offer educational tours of their operations and provide access for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tours, and generating income through educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming not only serves a profitable market niche but also promotes greater biodiversity in local flora and fauna, largely due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming presents its own challenges, including higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements for pest control, weed management, and natural fertilization, and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional methods. Smaller organic operations also lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, can further increase operational costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, which adjoins the Cleveland National Forest, consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially threatened species like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. This case study examined a real property listing and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small farmers interested in balancing operational costs with wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model for potential achievement.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond—whether positive or negative—becomes most apparent. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences. Understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not how others perceive them, but their true selves reflected back.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship between two brothers against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to tragic consequences. The story's themes unfold through the characterization of Doodle and the narrator's perspective, revealing complex emotional dynamics that drive their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle until their final tragic encounter, the protagonist harbors mixed feelings of resentment and hope. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures—swimming, running, climbing trees in Old Woman Swamp, racing to Horsehead Landing, and sitting high in the pine trees behind the barn. These dreams were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests dramatically, even leading to dark thoughts of infanticide, yet these thoughts dissolve when Doodle simply smiles at him. This simple gesture reveals the underlying love that exists beneath the surface of their complicated relationship, showing that even in his darkest moments, the protagonist's brotherly affection remains intact.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. Throughout history, as technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, the metaphors used to understand the brain evolved accordingly - from comparisons to wax tablets, to papyrus sheets, to books, and eventually to computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons are converted into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. Consider viewing a black box against a white background: bottom-up processing combines basic elements like color, orientation, and edge detection to form the image of a box, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance recognition, helping distinguish whether it's a solid black box or a box-shaped void in the white surface.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filter to determine the significance of processed information and direct it to appropriate cognitive functions. While your brain processes all visual input, such as individual grass blades when looking at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents information overload. Conversely, certain stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded room, may break through this filter. Information undergoes multiple processing stages, continuously modified by attention mechanisms.\n\nInformation storage is fundamental to brain processing, occurring through various memory systems including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information encoding varies by sensory type - for instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Memory maintenance differs by type: working memory, lasting about 20 seconds, appears to involve electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits, while long-term memory is believed to be preserved in protein structures.\n\nVarious models exist to explain knowledge organization in the brain, derived from memory retrieval studies, computer science principles, and neurophysiological research. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, the concept \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating a web of related ideas.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. As we continue to feel the effects of this recession today, we must examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks found themselves short on reserves, causing a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times presciently reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years further entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets in housing-related investments, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's transformation into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your writing where you spread your creative wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical prose. Or more likely, it's the part where your readers doze off or click away in frustration, silently cursing your name. Even Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like a mischievous imp on your shoulder, whispering that you should quickly dispense with the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other imp urging you to share every minute detail of each character's upbringing).\n\nExposition is essentially narrating events to your audience in straightforward prose. In films, it manifests when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about a heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions his deep love for his wife. Similarly, you'd expect to see how the heroine's life was transformed and enriched by his presence through various significant and subtle details (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection with his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: her attractions, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through his perspective. This way, readers would truly share in her grief at his death, forming a stronger connection with the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic skeleton of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. While it might be tempting to rush through certain elements - like introducing a new character with a rapid-fire list of facts about their Air Force background, current job as a gas station night manager, two marriages, childless status, fishing hobby, secret ambitions of ownership, and breakfast preferences - this approach rarely serves the story well.",

A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife multiple times. While showing his mugshot, which portrayed a menacing appearance, they spent about two minutes on this developing story, providing basic details about his arrest.\n\nThe second report concerned an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no suspects or arrests at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. The brevity of this coverage seemed potentially linked to racial bias, as I've observed that crimes against minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThey then reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as coming from a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s. This shorter segment appeared designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nA story about a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus followed, with what seemed like disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description of the six-foot-tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie.\n\nThe final story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of marijuana distribution to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, and made what appeared to be an unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. ETFs also offer the advantage of wide selection across various fund types. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always analyze whether claimed advantages like diversification are genuine and to what extent they exist.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nGiven the impracticality of analyzing every holding, we've focused on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The analysis includes their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations are shown in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% increase) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings might offer superior returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance of these differences, we calculated the standard deviation for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline: the arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. Additionally, December coincides with the fall semester's end, when the community is overwhelmed with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these pressures. The holiday season and subsequent extended break for students and faculty also meant reduced campus presence. When classes resumed in late January, participation remained low, and February's numbers were particularly puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted participation for that month. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is confronting the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To overcome this, incentivization proved crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates for local businesses - restaurants, cafes, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers - we later wondered if more substantial rewards might have yielded better results. The possibility of winning major prizes like a new bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car could have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Our incentive structure remained relatively static throughout the project; implementing an escalating prize value system - starting with gift cards and progressing to more significant rewards like bicycles and ultimately a hybrid or electric vehicle - might have maintained or even increased engagement levels rather than allowing them to drop.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the common poetic elements across most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics found in several later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking common feature among these trick films was their indoor set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its proscenium position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-based approach was that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining static even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from Edison's trick films catalog, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following standard early film practices, actors remained in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a one-shot-equals-one-film format, typically resulting in films lasting about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint limited their dramatic and narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style illusions such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears as one continuous shot to casual viewers.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and nomenclature, a paradoxical rhetoric of \"old-new,\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both criticism and praise, being denounced for lacking genuine depth while simultaneously celebrated for evoking what Burke called \"the terrible sublime.\" The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romance to create the prototype of the Gothic genre and establish a new form of literary expression.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. In the face of \"modern\" social and literary \"advancement,\" it was considered antiquated or unsophisticated. However, the fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format (which allowed readers more intimate access to character psychology) enabled Gothic literature to endure and appear simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original writing period.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most prominent Gothic concepts present in Gothic novels. The medieval notion of chivalry, the process of cultivating a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held particular significance for Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and what these writers (especially Walpole) perceived as its absence in contemporary society. Through the employment of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (suggesting the genre's eventual evolution toward Romanticism) and serves as a tool for attempting to improve the present.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to reach the end customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nSupply chain management consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundational first step in the supply chain process. It determines the when, why, where, and how of all production activities. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of customer demand. Once management comprehends market demands, they can make decisions about product types and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations, considering factors like plant capacity, quality capabilities, and alignment with customer satisfaction goals. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The production phase is crucial, and attention to detail is essential, as oversights can result in significant time and financial costs. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed procedures for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and determining appropriate outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period's aristocratic society. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand out as two Victorian novels that deviate from this tradition. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and unusual occurrences, which is uncommon for novels of that era, but this approach serves to strengthen their character development by providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"And now, a flood of confusing and perplexing thoughts invaded his mind. He felt as though he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit during their heated argument - their very words echoing in his ears. When he managed to regain his awareness, he discovered he was speaking to them. Without warning, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything became chaos and confusion as some invisible force hastily pulled him away. Throughout these swift visions, there remained a vague, persistent awareness of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two novels frequently employ mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their purpose and content differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver experiences the event vividly in a dream-like state while seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness over these events and his deteriorating health, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him completely, numbing his senses to the point where he fails to notice the \"invisible force\" carrying him away. He relives his despair without the initial shock of pain, as the pain has become a constant companion to his fear rather than a surprise. Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about whose will directed his misfortune, as it clearly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces Oliver's lack of control, showing how he cannot even attempt to influence events even when his life hangs in the balance. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one would expect Oliver to make some effort, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n\"The day passed - day? There was no day; it vanished as quickly as it came - and night descended once again; a night so endless yet so brief; long in its terrible silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something seemed off about his situation: his difficulties were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while completely struggling with others, which was peculiar. Though clearly of Latino descent, he spoke English fluently. We continued to work together until I met his mother. While I was watching a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip, his mother came in. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was still learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read just fine; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can be a major hurdle. While we can all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the fix was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these approaches alone can solve this issue. The key lies in combining all these methods!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, this is incorrect. If we implement these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aids or tutors in our schools.",
            "From our earliest childhood, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some seek understanding through Sunday school, others through Temple, while many search for answers within themselves. Many accept the religious traditions handed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, refusing to believe in anything beyond their own personal universe. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to later replace it with another. Regardless of our chosen path, we all journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for light to guide us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat together on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while rain drummed against the tin roof above us. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze drifted into the rain, part searching, part remembering. His body had grown thinner lately, clothes hanging loose, his hair noticeably thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him - speaking about it would only make it more real for us both. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. Though chemotherapy and radiation extended his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they didn't ease his suffering - I questioned the value of prolonging his pain. I struggled with faith, wondering what kind of God would allow this. In my solitary nights, I offered no prayers, believing that if God existed, He had long since stopped listening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final transition from this life. I chose not to be present, wanting to preserve memories of how he lived rather than how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and understood he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man renowned for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held a strong conviction in natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended the creation of a society based on public good and led to the formation of sub-societies thriving at others' expense. A good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blank as I took in the scene before me. With practiced detachment, I observed silently, my mind analyzing what lay before my eyes without connecting it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts came and went, fleeting like shadows. My consciousness worked with such clarity that it seemed I wasn't thinking at all, but rather experiencing a fluid awareness of what I saw.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I had longed to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to understanding how the brain processes visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around whatever you wish to study. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into simpler elements: just the bowl on a plane.\n\nIn that moment, looking down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was too overwhelmed, too stunned to do anything but stare in amazement. Just as Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, if I were to claim any artistic perspective, this would be my beginning - my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, my intentions taking physical form in what could have been my most creative moment. The water swirled peacefully, crystal clear. Particles broke free and disappeared into nothingness. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, like a reluctant slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at the crude deposit someone had left as a challenge for the Rite Aid bathroom cleaners. After several more flushes and moments of contemplation, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping layer upon layer until it resembled a protective mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, much like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are losing their lives on the roads. Multiple factors contribute to this deadly statistical trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not developed enough to handle the dangers of driving. Basic lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and road departures.\n\nTeenagers face even greater risks when traveling with peers—something that anyone with common sense knows happens frequently. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident rates.\n\nWhile California and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety through provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains that statistically, the youngest drivers as a group simply cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 commonly seek thrills purely for the sensation. Therefore, it makes sense to postpone driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. If we maintain current licensing practices for young teens, we'll not only continue to see fatal accidents but likely witness a dramatic surge in deaths in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nThe legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. A provisional license system could remain in place before full licensing, along with required practical training hours based on existing state standards (such as California's requirement of 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, national uniform legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting young people nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics and warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first identified in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds, problems distinguishing between different acoustic events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking (where one sound blocks another), difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and specialized auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. While there is currently no standardized diagnostic tool or known cause, testing often involves evaluating responses to multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and may include advanced acoustic measurements.",
            "In pursuing a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values aren't merely professional requirements – they're deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though initially, I was uncertain about my career direction. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the police's request, noting how they nervously dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, particularly to help children facing family challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that resonates deeply with me. While our society claims to value individuality and mourns lost lives, we often pressure people to conform to traditional norms. I've always challenged social injustice, expressing my individuality through unconventional hair colors, personal style choices, multiple ear piercings, and active participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I've consistently stood against racism and discrimination whenever I've encountered it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I will continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model examines inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model investigates environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models of insomnia and explains the selected research to better illustrate these models. The research and its findings are then critically analyzed to highlight their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders, or sleep disorders related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include sleep-wake disorders or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other types of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance intake.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic, hereditary, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors exist on orexin neurons, specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep-promoting responses. When its firing is inhibited, this can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for approximately two and a half years, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dormitory in East Halls, which is essentially at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building near campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nIn conversation with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed with athletic fields, major new facilities including the new Creamery and health services building, and are now surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a university campus, the bicycle proves to be the best answer. However, bicycles alone aren't the complete solution - students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He expressed surprise at having ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduate students, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dormitories. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas Building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this journey to just 5 minutes when riding at a good pace. The only challenge is that while Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, it isn't always easily navigable, whether on bike or foot. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for that option. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable means of reaching classes. Walking to Thomas Building daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalist structures through his creation of a dystopian society. The novel portrays a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and where citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a grand scheme, confined within an ideological framework dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist lens, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification, reinforcing its position as a commentary on the economic systems emerging in Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein the general population remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on their personal gains. This ignorance stems from ideological control of the working classes, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning methods in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. The World Controller manipulates this system through hegemony, where one group completely dominates other social classes. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. While upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most Alphas and Betas, with few exceptions like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nMeaningful interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack psychological depth - perhaps Huxley's commentary on how the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its authenticity and free expression. True love is non-existent, and emotional extremes are suppressed. Instead, interactions remain superficial, with men focusing on women's physical attributes (described as \"pneumatic\"), and women openly discussing their casual encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further illustrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and maintain their position alongside their peers.",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in our class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed how mass media has shifted from initially viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to now displaying an almost excessive tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has clear Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it appears to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure who was misunderstood and showed humility, with people gradually discovering the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' A notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived surrounded by truth and miracles. This approach seems problematic as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly intended to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, these stories often rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes these accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This characterization appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history from a broader perspective, we can observe Christianity gradually moving away from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be significant enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will greatly increase in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines that were added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. It will return to its original form. A movement will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message to humanity on behalf of God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as if they were living in Jesus's time and following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the extreme diversification in Christianity will reverse toward greater uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see increasing similarities. Human history is full of great reversals - consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution, or how our country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal in our future will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified but divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally prioritize their own interests and well-being, often disregarding those beneath them in social standing. The novel demonstrates this through various examples, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing their success, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair illustrates the devastating environmental impact of industrial pollution. The owners show no concern for the harm caused by their factories' emissions or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe treatment of workers further exemplifies this callousness. As the text notes, \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, brutal working hours, and dangerous conditions, with no job security or protection. During this period, the absence of labor laws left workers vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nWhile never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these deplorable conditions both at work and in their living environments. The lack of support systems or legitimate workers' organizations left them trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. The situation was so dire that workers were effectively reduced to slaves, as described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finest poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary source worth noting. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he turns to heavy drinking and weeps for his departed queen. Eventually, he decides it's time for his own death, bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" bear striking similarities, perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and struggles with alcohol. In 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on spilled applesauce in a grocery store might be eligible for punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager acted maliciously by failing to clean up a spill for 30 minutes after being notified twice, as he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of an uncleaned spill, given that multiple D&D customers had previously been injured from slipping. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's failure to maintain store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on his dinner break, claimed he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. That year, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety. California courts have found malicious conduct when defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet willfully and deliberately failed to avoid them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something missing in her life - an unfulfillable longing that began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. Now at 17, that feeling persisted. She had come to realize that what she yearned for was someone rather than something, yet she found herself strangely uninterested in boys. Though some had been drawn to her, attempting awkwardly to court the un-courtable, none had captured her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. And so she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nHome life was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to this serene couple, she balanced their calm energy with her vibrant and fun-loving personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite endearing to others.\n\nBut today was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panicked, crying out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, wincing in pain and letting out short, pained breaths. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out to help. \"Ouch... honey, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. The daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for the strength-training classes she had taken. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with fear. But she noticed none of this, her mind focused solely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around as someone quickly brought a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while reducing animal products and saturated fats consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study also demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically addressed stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38-63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These participants were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which followed 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random variations and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet (indicated by higher aMed scores) was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed score quintile showed significantly lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives on in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the actress known for \"Juno,\" stands solitary at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after their traditional robes' color. As public participation grew, the government's initial tolerance of peaceful monastic gatherings gave way to escalating violence, eventually developing into what many viewed as open warfare between the monks and military regime. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, while foreign journalists faced immediate arrest. One such journalist, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for documenting a protest. Though official records cite only 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed, \"The true death toll reaches thousands, far beyond what's been reported.\"\n\nSuch oppression isn't unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule absolutely. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings themselves, while in modern times, President George W. Bush reportedly maintains close ties with religious conservative leadership.\n\nHistory offers stark examples of such authoritarian violence: the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000; the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates; and the Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jews across multiple nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his extraordinary ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original soundscapes for each composition. His profound understanding of each player's sound and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking masterpieces.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's innovative approach is exemplified in Creole Love Call, notably for his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece demonstrates his early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait that defined his entire career. This measured twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nFirst Chorus: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that grow rougher toward the end.\nSecond Chorus: A muted trumpet solo elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes.\nThird Chorus: An expansive high-register clarinet solo backed by subtle syncopated piano.\nFourth Chorus: Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nFifth Chorus: The piece's climax, featuring high-register reeds initiating call and response, supported by syncopated brass and rhythm sections.\nSixth Chorus: Returns to the original format, with voice and reeds in dialogue, the voice adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique.\nEnding: A brief conclusion featuring a vocal run and distinctive dissonant trombone finish.\n\nThis vocal approach to tonal coloring became a signature element throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This concept evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone brilliantly introduces the melody, exemplifying Ellington's innovative orchestration.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in their particular ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"zoologists have barely begun to express even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms,\" this observation remains relevant today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research examines how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns in a coiled shell are called whorls, which rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, and adjacent whorls are separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The shell's tip is called the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The standard way to orient a shell is in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nBelow is a method for counting whorls. First, examine the shell from above (apical view) and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The aperture's path can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis movement can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once expressed mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well towards many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be explored below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in increasing the presence of skilled health workers at births, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional medical treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low coverage rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating inequitable healthcare distribution across the country. Urban centers clearly have better access to healthcare services. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of society, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without specifically focusing on maternal and child pre- and post-pregnancy care. While program-specific \"vertical approaches\" are appealing due to their focused objectives and faster results, they have notable drawbacks. Such approaches often divert funding and human resources from other healthcare areas (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services). Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and poor coordination, resulting in increased administrative burden for supplies and funding management.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved tremendously over the last century, encompassing so many genres that a complete enumeration is nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit typically leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, there are so many specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become challenging. While it has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, like everything else, it has its origins. To properly comprehend the ubiquitous metal music of today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitive but more technically demanding; metal musicians demonstrate exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly experimental approaches, resulting in otherworldly recordings, with drugs often cited as the catalyst for such creative expression. It embodies many dark, visceral qualities, which was revolutionary in a music scene where popular music typically avoided the darker aspects of emotional expression. Additionally, subsequent generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities that were prominent during the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-inspired works, Henri Rousseau was already carefully crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, while grappling with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong struggle: whether to conform to established painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own distinctive path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed middle-class comfort. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the loss of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist who shared the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside many other accomplished and renowned modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. According to Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, differed fundamentally in their approach and motivation: while Matisse feared creating conventional art, Rousseau actively sought to paint in such a conventional manner that he would gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life is acquired through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often preface their more detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe both art and morality can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's properties, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this same quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature provides the connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kantian terminology. They affect us in a way that can be experienced but never fully explained. This connection becomes even stronger in literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is truly unique about it, is its moral quality. While moral standards might be inappropriate for other arts, such as music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values... Literature matters to us precisely because of the values we find within it.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, exhibiting a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This cultural continuity flows from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany's heartland, to the Elbe-situated Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural landscape, it's natural that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage the Gauls. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowing it from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. While the name's true origin remains unclear, some suggest it meant \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, while others connect it to the German spear (ger) or the Old Irish word \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nIn his 98 AD work \"On the Origin and Geography of Germania,\" Tacitus portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, untouched by foreign influence through migration or interaction. He noted the improbability of voluntary migration to Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate, suggesting only natives would choose such a homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves showed little interest in permanent settlement in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire's comforts. By the mid-first century, Germanic tribes established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as an effective tool for prolonged deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their authentic selves. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, potentially leading to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their true identity or maintaining their relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take great offense at the deception.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such masquerade. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes further complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, Twelfth Night can be interpreted as demonstrating how deception might catalyze the revelation of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest these characters harbor unexplored desires that Viola's presence as Cesario forces them to confront. However, rather than suggesting Olivia harbors same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely intended her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "German colonial rule was known for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, an entire colonial empire cannot be summarized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited diversity in both its policies and governing styles, much like its geographical spread. Education across the colonies showed similar variation. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated, literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) presented a striking contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in native education, in South West Africa, indigenous education was almost entirely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government made substantial investments in European settlers' education, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only countries where the United States faced persistent, long-term diplomatic challenges. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these tensions, while other Latin American nations maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) notes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by disability due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, despite dreaming of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46, single, virtually no savings, and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know for sure: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too big to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly existence and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being recognized as its most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five hundred years; its present form differs significantly from what it was during Buddha's time. These changes are evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nSeveral qualifying terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist order, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will appear repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical components. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Along with Samsara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will end when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial element in any negotiation process. Rather than being defined solely by what it is, culture can often be better understood by what it is not. Culture is neither uniform nor concrete - it's a complex, multifaceted concept. Making broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplifies reality. While cultural generalizations can provide useful context, negotiators benefit more from understanding how specific cultural elements influence the matter at hand and shape negotiation dynamics. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally interpret it through the lens of their own cultural experience, drawing inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires comprehensive effort, from studying its historical background to recognizing its inherent biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to modify cultural practices, one should accept them as they are and work within cultural parameters, particularly during negotiations - especially when operating from a position of lesser leverage. When negotiating in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and facilitate productive dialogue.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Organizations within the same country often develop distinct corporate cultures. These might manifest in various ways, such as expectations about working hours or workplace flexibility. Corporate culture becomes visible through dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), leadership approaches, and recruitment policies. Some organizations actively promote charitable giving among employees, while others limit it to company-sanctioned initiatives. The diversity of American corporate cultures - even within the same company across different locations and settings - demonstrates how varied cultural expression can be within a broader societal framework. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous to outsiders, such uniformity often masks deeper complexities.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is particularly crucial as they explain the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize maintaining face or group harmony, negotiators are unlikely to risk public embarrassment of their organization or leadership to achieve negotiation goals. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that value aggressive bargaining may not rush to reach quick agreements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider before negotiations begin, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts on a personal level to enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Thomas Aquinas appears to share this perspective. Since both their arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which argument is superior, we must, for the sake of conciseness, begin with the assumption that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. To consider a divine figure different from the one these authors believe in would prevent us from properly comparing their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. Nevertheless, I would argue that while both present valid points, neither provides a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path to understanding through faith, seeking evidence of God through introspection. He argues that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, when expressed in his terminology, is somewhat lengthy and occasionally unclear, its core message is that the proof of God resides within the human mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, the reality of this being can be discovered simply by examining the inherent truths within our minds. External evidence appears unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective differs significantly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith whatsoever. This approach would be valuable for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable claims. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas elaborates on five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each argument, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and completing the rest of the puzzle – logic dictates that you can know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers toward important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. At times, Fitzgerald creates unusual pairings of adjectives and nouns to establish a particular atmosphere for readers. In other instances, he assigns symbolic meanings to elements and employs them for similar purposes. Fitzgerald applies this technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops specific meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then strategically uses these associations to evoke certain emotional responses in readers when encountering important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald constructs for white/gray centers on uniformity, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray implies age and fading. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel through repeated use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" party guests become \"gray names\" in Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is merely \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all emphasizing uniformity and conformity.",
            "San Diego County enjoys remarkable agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. The region produces a diverse range of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, stone fruits like peaches, lemons, various berries, honey, and peppers. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products are particularly sought after. Many organic farms offer educational tours of their operations and provide access for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching.\n\nThis type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing natural habitats, creating opportunities for farm tours, and generating income through educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming not only serves a profitable market niche but also promotes greater biodiversity in local flora and fauna, largely due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming presents its own challenges, including higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements for pest control, weed management, and natural fertilization, and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional methods. Smaller organic operations also lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species management, and habitat maintenance, can further increase operational costs. These factors often lead landowners to seek financial assistance and expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel bordering Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land, which adjoins the Cleveland National Forest, consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially threatened species like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area's rich history spans centuries of Native American habitation, followed by settlement by cattle ranchers and firewood merchants in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. This case study examined a real property listing and available government programs to evaluate realistic options for small farmers interested in balancing operational costs with wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model for potential achievement.",
            "The relationship between brothers is an unbreakable and eternal bond, encompassing various emotions including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more deeply than any other relationship, seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. It's during the most challenging times that the true nature of this bond—whether positive or negative—becomes most apparent. When these emotions surface, they often come with significant consequences. Understanding these fraternal feelings means accepting their repercussions. When brothers look into each other's eyes, they see not how others perceive them, but their true selves reflected back.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship between two brothers against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, showcases the clash between bitter disappointment and overwhelming pride, leading to tragic consequences. The story's themes unfold through the characterization of Doodle and the narrator's perspective, revealing complex emotional dynamics that drive their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. From his earliest interactions with his younger brother Doodle until their final tragic encounter, the protagonist harbors mixed feelings of resentment and hope. He had dreamed of a brother who could share in his adventures—swimming, running, climbing trees in Old Woman Swamp, racing to Horsehead Landing, and sitting high in the pine trees behind the barn. These dreams were shattered by Doodle's physical limitations due to his weak heart, a condition that initially threatened even his survival. The protagonist's frustration manifests dramatically, even leading to dark thoughts of infanticide, yet these thoughts dissolve when Doodle simply smiles at him. This simple gesture reveals the underlying love that exists beneath the surface of their complicated relationship, showing that even in his darkest moments, the protagonist's brotherly affection remains intact.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. Throughout history, as technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, the metaphors used to understand the brain evolved accordingly - from comparisons to wax tablets, to papyrus sheets, to books, and eventually to computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and might lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons are converted into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. Consider viewing a black box against a white background: bottom-up processing combines basic elements like color, orientation, and edge detection to form the image of a box, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance recognition, helping distinguish whether it's a solid black box or a box-shaped void in the white surface.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filter to determine the significance of processed information and direct it to appropriate cognitive functions. While your brain processes all visual input, such as individual grass blades when looking at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents information overload. Conversely, certain stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded room, may break through this filter. Information undergoes multiple processing stages, continuously modified by attention mechanisms.\n\nInformation storage is fundamental to brain processing, occurring through various memory systems including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information encoding varies by sensory type - for instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (visual appearance), phonemically (sound), or semantically (meaning). Memory maintenance differs by type: working memory, lasting about 20 seconds, appears to involve electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits, while long-term memory is believed to be preserved in protein structures.\n\nVarious models exist to explain knowledge organization in the brain, derived from memory retrieval studies, computer science principles, and neurophysiological research. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, the concept \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating a web of related ideas.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major American corporations marked this period. As we continue to feel the effects of this recession today, we must examine its causes and potential preventive measures. At its core, the crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an inadequate financial framework. Additionally, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers began defaulting on their loans, banks found themselves short on reserves, causing a chain reaction that spread throughout the repackaged mortgage market and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to boost his popularity for a second term. His administration loosened lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times presciently reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton administration to expand lending to low and moderate-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth for shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted that this government-backed corporation might require a rescue similar to the savings and loan industry bailout of the 1980s during an economic downturn.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the emergence of complex mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years further entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets in housing-related investments, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, equivalent to roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's transformation into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - that moment in your writing where you spread your creative wings and soar, supposedly dazzling everyone with your captivating, almost magical prose. Or more likely, it's the part where your readers doze off or click away in frustration, silently cursing your name. Even Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when drowning in excessive information, and not in any enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or paradoxically, too much happens. Exposition is like a mischievous imp on your shoulder, whispering that you should quickly dispense with the background information to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the other imp urging you to share every minute detail of each character's upbringing).\n\nExposition is essentially narrating events to your audience in straightforward prose. In films, it manifests when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where you're told about a heroine meeting her true love, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only four lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions his deep love for his wife. Similarly, you'd expect to see how the heroine's life was transformed and enriched by his presence through various significant and subtle details (especially if this becomes important later in the story). A proper character development would allow readers to form an emotional connection with his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: her attractions, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through his perspective. This way, readers would truly share in her grief at his death, forming a stronger connection with the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to flesh out the basic skeleton of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. While it might be tempting to rush through certain elements - like introducing a new character with a rapid-fire list of facts about their Air Force background, current job as a gas station night manager, two marriages, childless status, fishing hobby, secret ambitions of ownership, and breakfast preferences - this approach rarely serves the story well.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The primary story on NBC 4's live morning broadcast (August 13, 2011) covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife multiple times. While showing his mugshot, which portrayed a menacing appearance, they spent about two minutes on this developing story, providing basic details about his arrest.\n\nThe second report concerned an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically wounded, with no suspects or arrests at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. The brevity of this coverage seemed potentially linked to racial bias, as I've observed that crimes against minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThey then reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as coming from a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected in the mid to low 80s. This shorter segment appeared designed to keep viewers watching.\n\nA story about a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus followed, with what seemed like disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description of the six-foot-tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie.\n\nThe final story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of marijuana distribution to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than 25 years, and made what appeared to be an unnecessary mention of his Hispanic ethnicity.",
            "An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these features are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. ETFs also offer the advantage of wide selection across various fund types. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always analyze whether claimed advantages like diversification are genuine and to what extent they exist.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nGiven the impracticality of analyzing every holding, we've focused on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The analysis includes their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we normalized their asset percentages to 100% and calculated each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The calculations are shown in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF (a 16% increase) while maintaining a Beta 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings might offer superior returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance of these differences, we calculated the standard deviation for each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. Several factors may have contributed to this decline: the arrival of winter weather at our New England campus naturally reduced bicycle and pedestrian commuting. Additionally, December coincides with the fall semester's end, when the community is overwhelmed with final assignments, grading, and other academic responsibilities. Many participants likely forgot about the commuter log amid these pressures. The holiday season and subsequent extended break for students and faculty also meant reduced campus presence. When classes resumed in late January, participation remained low, and February's numbers were particularly puzzling. One could argue that such initiatives typically experience high initial enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March - a focused campaign that successfully boosted participation for that month. This highlighted our ongoing challenge: maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and the academic calendar's disruptions.\n\nA fundamental challenge for any alternative transportation initiative is confronting the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To overcome this, incentivization proved crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates for local businesses - restaurants, cafes, massage services, bookstores, and national retailers - we later wondered if more substantial rewards might have yielded better results. The possibility of winning major prizes like a new bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car could have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Our incentive structure remained relatively static throughout the project; implementing an escalating prize value system - starting with gift cards and progressing to more significant rewards like bicycles and ultimately a hybrid or electric vehicle - might have maintained or even increased engagement levels rather than allowing them to drop.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employed creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the common poetic elements across most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics found in several later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to a one-shot-per-film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking common feature among these trick films was their indoor set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its proscenium position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional style, deeply rooted in theater and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-based approach was that characters typically moved only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is evident in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally, with the camera remaining static even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from Edison's trick films catalog, reflecting the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. Following standard early film practices, actors remained in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up shots.\n\nMost early trick films followed a one-shot-equals-one-film format, typically resulting in films lasting about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint limited their dramatic and narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style illusions such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is exemplified in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, though the film appears as one continuous shot to casual viewers.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and nomenclature, a paradoxical rhetoric of \"old-new,\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both criticism and praise, being denounced for lacking genuine depth while simultaneously celebrated for evoking what Burke called \"the terrible sublime.\" The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romance to create the prototype of the Gothic genre and establish a new form of literary expression.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. In the face of \"modern\" social and literary \"advancement,\" it was considered antiquated or unsophisticated. However, the fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format (which allowed readers more intimate access to character psychology) enabled Gothic literature to endure and appear simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original writing period.\n\nChivalry stands as one of the most prominent Gothic concepts present in Gothic novels. The medieval notion of chivalry, the process of cultivating a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held particular significance for Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and what these writers (especially Walpole) perceived as its absence in contemporary society. Through the employment of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (suggesting the genre's eventual evolution toward Romanticism) and serves as a tool for attempting to improve the present.",
            "Supply chain management refers to the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to reach the end customer. The concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly.\n\nSupply chain management consists of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundational first step in the supply chain process. It determines the when, why, where, and how of all production activities. Managers must understand customer preferences by analyzing market trends, which serve as the primary indicator of customer demand. Once management comprehends market demands, they can make decisions about product types and quantities. They then determine optimal production locations, considering factors like plant capacity, quality capabilities, and alignment with customer satisfaction goals. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The production phase is crucial, and attention to detail is essential, as oversights can result in significant time and financial costs. For instance, major retailers like Walmart and Target maintain detailed procedures for everything from employee uniforms to shipment receiving, ensuring smooth operations through clear guidelines and expectations.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and determining appropriate outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must determine the most suitable division for different production processes and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period's aristocratic society. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand out as two Victorian novels that deviate from this tradition. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and unusual occurrences, which is uncommon for novels of that era, but this approach serves to strengthen their character development by providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\n\"And now, a flood of confusing and perplexing thoughts invaded his mind. He felt as though he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit during their heated argument - their very words echoing in his ears. When he managed to regain his awareness, he discovered he was speaking to them. Without warning, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything became chaos and confusion as some invisible force hastily pulled him away. Throughout these swift visions, there remained a vague, persistent awareness of pain that continuously tormented him.\"\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two novels frequently employ mystery through dreams or dream-like states, though their purpose and content differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner world, his sufferings, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver experiences the event vividly in a dream-like state while seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness over these events and his deteriorating health, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him completely, numbing his senses to the point where he fails to notice the \"invisible force\" carrying him away. He relives his despair without the initial shock of pain, as the pain has become a constant companion to his fear rather than a surprise. Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about whose will directed his misfortune, as it clearly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces Oliver's lack of control, showing how he cannot even attempt to influence events even when his life hangs in the balance. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one would expect Oliver to make some effort, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n\"The day passed - day? There was no day; it vanished as quickly as it came - and night descended once again; a night so endless yet so brief; long in its terrible silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years ago, I tutored elementary school students in an after-school program. While I tried to help them with all subjects, my expertise was in English and reading. One instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was struggling significantly with reading. Something seemed off about his situation: his difficulties were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while completely struggling with others, which was peculiar. Though clearly of Latino descent, he spoke English fluently. We continued to work together until I met his mother. While I was watching a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip, his mother came in. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish (which I was still learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me: Adrian could read just fine; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issues in schools, particularly in California, and to show that these problems aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can be a major hurdle. While we can all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? For Adrian, the fix was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes – none of these approaches alone can solve this issue. The key lies in combining all these methods!\n\nFirst, the dual language system is an excellent approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs academically outperform their peers. While some fear it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, this is incorrect. If we implement these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual special aids or tutors in our schools.",
            "From our earliest childhood, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some seek understanding through Sunday school, others through Temple, while many search for answers within themselves. Many accept the religious traditions handed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, refusing to believe in anything beyond their own personal universe. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to later replace it with another. Regardless of our chosen path, we all journey to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for light to guide us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat together on the front porch, smoking cigarettes while rain drummed against the tin roof above us. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze drifted into the rain, part searching, part remembering. His body had grown thinner lately, clothes hanging loose, his hair noticeably thinner than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him - speaking about it would only make it more real for us both. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. Though chemotherapy and radiation extended his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they didn't ease his suffering - I questioned the value of prolonging his pain. I struggled with faith, wondering what kind of God would allow this. In my solitary nights, I offered no prayers, believing that if God existed, He had long since stopped listening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final transition from this life. I chose not to be present, wanting to preserve memories of how he lived rather than how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and understood he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man renowned for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal liberty and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the foundation for virtually all his governmental perspectives. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, as there were no indigenous traditions to constrain the nation's founders, enabling the establishment of true self-governance. He held a strong conviction in natural human rights, believing them to be interconnected—if one right was denied, all would ultimately fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. These rights, he maintained, should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" benefited those with physical strength and malicious intelligence, but insisted this should not be the way in a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor believed in creating a government that acknowledged humanity's inherent capacity for both good and evil. He was uncompromising in his dualistic moral views, asserting that \"since government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified good principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and restraining capitalism, believing that a government founded on sound principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it evil only when it transcended the creation of a society based on public good and led to the formation of sub-societies thriving at others' expense. A good government was essential to contain humanity's natural evil tendencies, though even then it required vigilant oversight to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to only those rights and powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He understood that an expansive federal government was costly and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against mere literal interpretation, believing that without considering the founders' intent, such an approach could become corrupted. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true charter, as it more explicitly portrayed the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blank as I took in the scene before me. With practiced detachment, I observed silently, my mind analyzing what lay before my eyes without connecting it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts came and went, fleeting like shadows. My consciousness worked with such clarity that it seemed I wasn't thinking at all, but rather experiencing a fluid awareness of what I saw.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I had longed to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to understanding how the brain processes visual information. One key technique it taught was framing - placing a mental square around whatever you wish to study. This transforms complex scenes, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into simpler elements: just the bowl on a plane.\n\nIn that moment, looking down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was too overwhelmed, too stunned to do anything but stare in amazement. Just as Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, if I were to claim any artistic perspective, this would be my beginning - my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers grasped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, my intentions taking physical form in what could have been my most creative moment. The water swirled peacefully, crystal clear. Particles broke free and disappeared into nothingness. With increasing urgency, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, like a reluctant slug.\n\nStanding there in my green tie, feet planted apart, holding a mop loosely, I frowned at the crude deposit someone had left as a challenge for the Rite Aid bathroom cleaners. After several more flushes and moments of contemplation, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping layer upon layer until it resembled a protective mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, I lowered my hand into the bowl, much like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are losing their lives on the roads. Multiple factors contribute to this deadly statistical trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not developed enough to handle the dangers of driving. Basic lack of experience is another fundamental issue. This inexperience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and road departures.\n\nTeenagers face even greater risks when traveling with peers—something that anyone with common sense knows happens frequently. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a clear connection between passenger age and accident rates.\n\nWhile California and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety through provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers, these measures are, in my view, merely temporary solutions. The core issue remains that statistically, the youngest drivers as a group simply cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 commonly seek thrills purely for the sensation. Therefore, it makes sense to postpone driving privileges until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. If we maintain current licensing practices for young teens, we'll not only continue to see fatal accidents but likely witness a dramatic surge in deaths in coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.\n\nThe legislative solution could be relatively simple: while schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a vehicle. A provisional license system could remain in place before full licensing, along with required practical training hours based on existing state standards (such as California's requirement of 6 hours of professional training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, national uniform legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting young people nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This paper examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). The discussion begins with a concise definition of the condition, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, including typical characteristics and warning signs. The paper concludes by exploring strategies that mainstream classroom teachers can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how effectively the central nervous system processes auditory information. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing ability, their brains struggle to properly process and interpret auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or separating speech from background noise.\n\nThe condition was first identified in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough work on dichotic testing in 1961. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents various symptoms: difficulty localizing sounds, problems distinguishing between different acoustic events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking (where one sound blocks another), difficulty processing sound information meaningfully, and problems with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive screening through systematic observation of listening behavior and specialized auditory function tests. These assessments may be conducted by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. While there is currently no standardized diagnostic tool or known cause, testing often involves evaluating responses to multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and may include advanced acoustic measurements.",
            "In pursuing a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping abused or neglected children and supporting families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving interpersonal relationships, and commitment to professional development. These core values aren't merely professional requirements – they're deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though initially, I was uncertain about my career direction. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These observations led me to pursue a Psychology degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took time to reflect on my path. A pivotal moment came when I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. When he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to offer assistance. Using my psychology background, I spoke with the parents at the police's request, noting how they nervously dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, particularly to help children facing family challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that resonates deeply with me. While our society claims to value individuality and mourns lost lives, we often pressure people to conform to traditional norms. I've always challenged social injustice, expressing my individuality through unconventional hair colors, personal style choices, multiple ear piercings, and active participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I've consistently stood against racism and discrimination whenever I've encountered it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I will continue to advocate against social inequities.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model examines inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model investigates environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models of insomnia and explains the selected research to better illustrate these models. The research and its findings are then critically analyzed to highlight their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders, or sleep disorders related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include sleep-wake disorders or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other types of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance intake.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic, hereditary, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors exist on orexin neurons, specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep-promoting responses. When its firing is inhibited, this can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for approximately two and a half years, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dormitory in East Halls, which is essentially at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building near campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nIn conversation with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed with athletic fields, major new facilities including the new Creamery and health services building, and are now surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the ideal solution to this mobility issue? On a university campus, the bicycle proves to be the best answer. However, bicycles alone aren't the complete solution - students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He expressed surprise at having ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduate students, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the center as some dormitories. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas Building, normally a 25-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this journey to just 5 minutes when riding at a good pace. The only challenge is that while Pollock Road offers the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, it isn't always easily navigable, whether on bike or foot. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for that option. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable means of reaching classes. Walking to Thomas Building daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all other walking time for various classes and appointments, and it becomes an unsustainable time commitment.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalist structures through his creation of a dystopian society. The novel portrays a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and where citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. These citizens are revealed to be mere pieces in a grand scheme, confined within an ideological framework dictated by the World Controller. When analyzed through a Marxist lens, the author's underlying concerns about these developing systems become apparent. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification, reinforcing its position as a commentary on the economic systems emerging in Huxley's era.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein the general population remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on their personal gains. This ignorance stems from ideological control of the working classes, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning methods in Brave New World. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - lack genuine free will; through sleep-learning, their desires to consume, spend, and indulge are artificially enhanced. The World Controller manipulates this system through hegemony, where one group completely dominates other social classes. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. While upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation, most Alphas and Betas, with few exceptions like Bernard, simply accept their designated roles.\n\nMeaningful interpersonal relationships are notably absent in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, lack psychological depth - perhaps Huxley's commentary on how the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its authenticity and free expression. True love is non-existent, and emotional extremes are suppressed. Instead, interactions remain superficial, with men focusing on women's physical attributes (described as \"pneumatic\"), and women openly discussing their casual encounters. Each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position further illustrates capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to community roles reflects Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and maintain their position alongside their peers.",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the most contentious topics in our class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed how mass media has shifted from initially viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to now displaying an almost excessive tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has clear Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because it appears to contradict what I understand about Muhammad's historical character. My previous knowledge suggested that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr-like figure who was misunderstood and showed humility, with people gradually discovering the 'truth' in his teachings and seeking him out voluntarily.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' A notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men abundantly. This writing style suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived surrounded by truth and miracles. This approach seems problematic as it appears to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life, almost as if attempting to transfer Jesus's attributes to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts seemingly intended to provide 'witness testimony' of spontaneous conversions to Islam. However, these stories often rely on chain narratives - \"someone who heard from someone else who heard from another.\" Rather than strengthening their credibility, this approach actually makes these accounts seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle individual. This characterization appears to conflict with historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power, and I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the actual historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history from a broader perspective, we can observe Christianity gradually moving away from its origins. Today's world appears to show an increasing awakening and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditionalists still exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be significant enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will greatly increase in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish between doctrines that were added to Christianity over time and the true intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: there will be a major reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. It will return to its original form. A movement will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if turning back the clock, until only Jesus's original message to humanity on behalf of God remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as if they were living in Jesus's time and following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the extreme diversification in Christianity will reverse toward greater uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will see increasing similarities. Human history is full of great reversals - consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution, or how our country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal in our future will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified but divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that The Jungle reveals humanity's inherent greed and self-centeredness. People fundamentally prioritize their own interests and well-being, often disregarding those beneath them in social standing. The novel demonstrates this through various examples, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers.\n\nThese industrial leaders are singularly focused on expanding their enterprises and maximizing their success, showing complete disregard for any collateral damage their progress might cause. As Upton Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Through this imagery, Sinclair illustrates the devastating environmental impact of industrial pollution. The owners show no concern for the harm caused by their factories' emissions or the unsanitary conditions created by animal waste from countless livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe treatment of workers further exemplifies this callousness. As the text notes, \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary layoffs, brutal working hours, and dangerous conditions, with no job security or protection. During this period, the absence of labor laws left workers vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nWhile never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these deplorable conditions both at work and in their living environments. The lack of support systems or legitimate workers' organizations left them trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even labor unions often exploited rather than helped the workers. The situation was so dire that workers were effectively reduced to slaves, as described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finest poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to describe an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary source worth noting. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he turns to heavy drinking and weeps for his departed queen. Eventually, he decides it's time for his own death, bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" bear striking similarities, perhaps serving as a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and struggles with alcohol. In 1842, less than a year before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" H.P. Grattan adapted Faust into a romantic drama.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on spilled applesauce in a grocery store might be eligible for punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager acted maliciously by failing to clean up a spill for 30 minutes after being notified twice, as he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of an uncleaned spill, given that multiple D&D customers had previously been injured from slipping. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin's failure to maintain store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on his dinner break, claimed he \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. That year, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety. California courts have found malicious conduct when defendants were aware of probable dangerous consequences yet willfully and deliberately failed to avoid them, as established in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something missing in her life - an unfulfillable longing that began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. Now at 17, that feeling persisted. She had come to realize that what she yearned for was someone rather than something, yet she found herself strangely uninterested in boys. Though some had been drawn to her, attempting awkwardly to court the un-courtable, none had captured her interest. This peculiarity often led her to question herself, wondering what could cause such an unusual situation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. And so she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nHome life was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to this serene couple, she balanced their calm energy with her vibrant and fun-loving personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite endearing to others.\n\nBut today was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice release a sharp scream from the kitchen. She rushed in, panicked, crying out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, wincing in pain and letting out short, pained breaths. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out to help. \"Ouch... honey, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. The daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for the strength-training classes she had taken. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with fear. But she noticed none of this, her mind focused solely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around as someone quickly brought a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with decreased risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while reducing animal products and saturated fats consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention study also demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically addressed stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38-63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These participants were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which followed 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutritional intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random variations and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results revealed that stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet (indicated by higher aMed scores) was associated with reduced risk of CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed score quintile showed significantly lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives on in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the actress known for \"Juno,\" stands solitary at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in ten years. These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after their traditional robes' color. As public participation grew, the government's initial tolerance of peaceful monastic gatherings gave way to escalating violence, eventually developing into what many viewed as open warfare between the monks and military regime. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, while foreign journalists faced immediate arrest. One such journalist, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for documenting a protest. Though official records cite only 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win revealed, \"The true death toll reaches thousands, far beyond what's been reported.\"\n\nSuch oppression isn't unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule absolutely. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings themselves, while in modern times, President George W. Bush reportedly maintains close ties with religious conservative leadership.\n\nHistory offers stark examples of such authoritarian violence: the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where casualties ranged from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000; the 1990s Rwandan genocide, where government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates; and the Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, which systematically murdered millions of Jews across multiple nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his enduring career and his extraordinary ability to mold his orchestra. While Ellington's piano work remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his genius as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that leveraged each musician's unique style to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he shaped the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinct and original soundscapes for each composition. His profound understanding of each player's sound and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking masterpieces.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's innovative approach is exemplified in Creole Love Call, notably for his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece demonstrates his early experimentation with using vocals to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait that defined his entire career. This measured twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six choruses:\n\nFirst Chorus: A dialogue between voice and reeds, beginning with smooth, melodic vocals that grow rougher toward the end.\nSecond Chorus: A muted trumpet solo elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes.\nThird Chorus: An expansive high-register clarinet solo backed by subtle syncopated piano.\nFourth Chorus: Full ensemble recreates the first chorus's dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nFifth Chorus: The piece's climax, featuring high-register reeds initiating call and response, supported by syncopated brass and rhythm sections.\nSixth Chorus: Returns to the original format, with voice and reeds in dialogue, the voice adopting an instrumental \"growl\" technique.\nEnding: A brief conclusion featuring a vocal run and distinctive dissonant trombone finish.\n\nThis vocal approach to tonal coloring became a signature element throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with tonal exploration. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending vocal and instrumental qualities. This concept evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone brilliantly introduces the melody, exemplifying Ellington's innovative orchestration.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in their particular ways? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary changes? Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"zoologists have barely begun to express even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms,\" this observation remains relevant today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (for example, Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research examines how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral turns in a coiled shell are called whorls, which rotate around an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, and adjacent whorls are separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The shell's tip is called the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The standard way to orient a shell is in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nBelow is a method for counting whorls. First, examine the shell from above (apical view) and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, measuring to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The aperture's path can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis movement can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once expressed mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change over the past decade. While the country is progressing well towards many Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health fall significantly below the levels needed to achieve their 2015 targets. The various factors contributing to these deficiencies will be explored below, suggesting that strengthening the overall health system should take priority over focused programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in increasing the presence of skilled health workers at births, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the capability to handle medical complications during pregnancy (explaining the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). Thus, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in professional medical treatment for diarrheal cases among children under five. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires attention, with low coverage rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain suboptimal at around 4%. These rates also highlight a concerning disparity: urban areas show a 7% rate compared to just 2% in rural regions, indicating inequitable healthcare distribution across the country. Urban centers clearly have better access to healthcare services. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of society, suggesting that financial barriers significantly impact healthcare access for the poor.\n\nIn considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address service inadequacies most effectively. The debate centers on whether Indonesia should implement targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without specifically focusing on maternal and child pre- and post-pregnancy care. While program-specific \"vertical approaches\" are appealing due to their focused objectives and faster results, they have notable drawbacks. Such approaches often divert funding and human resources from other healthcare areas (as seen in how international HIV/AIDS funding affected family planning services). Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and poor coordination, resulting in increased administrative burden for supplies and funding management.",
            "The categorization of popular music has evolved tremendously over the last century, encompassing so many genres that a complete enumeration is nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually every genre—including rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many others—has developed numerous subgenres and further subdivisions within their respective domains. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit typically leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent shortly after its inception, when people began to recognize its inherent flexibility and started creating their own subgenres, which in turn spawned further subdivisions, a process that continues to this day.\n\nIn the contemporary heavy metal movement, there are so many specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become challenging. While it has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, like everything else, it has its origins. To properly comprehend the ubiquitous metal music of today, one must first understand the nature of the metal movement and why it constitutes a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many respects, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. Less primitive but more technically demanding; metal musicians demonstrate exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Metal is also—perhaps unsurprisingly—a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly experimental approaches, resulting in otherworldly recordings, with drugs often cited as the catalyst for such creative expression. It embodies many dark, visceral qualities, which was revolutionary in a music scene where popular music typically avoided the darker aspects of emotional expression. Additionally, subsequent generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities that were prominent during the Romantic Era.",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-inspired works, Henri Rousseau was already carefully crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting \"The Dream\" depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland, but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, while grappling with a profound internal conflict. \"The Dream\" best exemplifies Rousseau's lifelong struggle: whether to conform to established painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own distinctive path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed middle-class comfort. He received no formal artistic training in his youth; instead, he worked as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) until he was forty, though he was often mistakenly called a douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the loss of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. He sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist who shared the hopes and dreams of his social class.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance in the art world becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he lacked formal artistic training, began his career relatively late in life, and was creating art alongside many other accomplished and renowned modern artists. Despite working for many years, Rousseau didn't receive significant recognition until around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. According to Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" the two artists, though contemporaries, differed fundamentally in their approach and motivation: while Matisse feared creating conventional art, Rousseau actively sought to paint in such a conventional manner that he would gain acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers have theorized that there exists an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" While most knowledge in life is acquired through education or experience, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests, without conventional instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore significantly, criticism of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements ultimately fail to explain why it is great art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often preface their more detailed analysis with \"There's just something about it.\" I believe both art and morality can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's properties, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this same quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and their transcendental nature provides the connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kantian terminology. They affect us in a way that can be experienced but never fully explained. This connection becomes even stronger in literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is truly unique about it, is its moral quality. While moral standards might be inappropriate for other arts, such as music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values... Literature matters to us precisely because of the values we find within it.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, exhibiting a distinctive cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel. This cultural continuity flows from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany's heartland, to the Elbe-situated Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural landscape, it's natural that contemporary Germany emerged from diverse origins and tribal roots.\n\nGermania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. According to Tacitus, the name originated from the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage the Gauls. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowing it from the Gauls to distinguish between conquered and unconquered peoples. While the name's true origin remains unclear, some suggest it meant \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, while others connect it to the German spear (ger) or the Old Irish word \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nIn his 98 AD work \"On the Origin and Geography of Germania,\" Tacitus portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, untouched by foreign influence through migration or interaction. He noted the improbability of voluntary migration to Germania's harsh landscape and severe climate, suggesting only natives would choose such a homeland.\n\nThe Romans themselves showed little interest in permanent settlement in Germania, preferring instead to conduct trade missions and occasional military campaigns before returning to their empire's comforts. By the mid-first century, Germanic tribes established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, engaging in trade and often serving in the Roman military forces.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as an effective tool for prolonged deception, individuals must ultimately shed their assumed identities or risk losing their authentic selves. However, the process of ending such deception presents its own challenges, potentially leading to alienation. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their true identity or maintaining their relationships with others. While some people might react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, others may take great offense at the deception.\n\nThe issue of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, chief among them being the motivation behind such masquerade. Why would someone abandon their true identity to assume that of another gender? In Viola's case, it clearly stems from self-preservation, as evidenced when she says: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in unfamiliar territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection. While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. The situation becomes further complicated when her male disguise proves so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Additionally, she must navigate complex romantic tensions with Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nFrom a contemporary perspective, Twelfth Night can be interpreted as demonstrating how deception might catalyze the revelation of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest these characters harbor unexplored desires that Viola's presence as Cesario forces them to confront. However, rather than suggesting Olivia harbors same-sex attractions, Shakespeare more likely intended her character to satirize those who judge purely on appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "German colonial rule was known for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, an entire colonial empire cannot be summarized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited diversity in both its policies and governing styles, much like its geographical spread. Education across the colonies showed similar variation. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated, literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary writers.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) presented a striking contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in native education, in South West Africa, indigenous education was almost entirely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government made substantial investments in European settlers' education, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of two neighboring nations whose relationship was marked by a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), when the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the Southwest territories. Multiple conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests.\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring nations, as shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalrous relationships. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry exemplifies a typical pattern seen between adjacent nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only countries where the United States faced persistent, long-term diplomatic challenges. Their geographical proximity to the United States contributed to these tensions, while other Latin American nations maintained generally positive relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two countries, a common historical phenomenon. As Sally Frahm (2001) notes, while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts were primarily against Catholicism and monarchy. Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, the U.S.-Mexico rivalry was shaped by religious rather than political differences. This mutual distrust was inherited from their respective colonial powers, England and Spain, creating a substantial obstacle to developing friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States. Most of these conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier-related problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to control bandit and outlaw activities along their shared border.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States. The relationship finally transformed when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by disability due to an illness I had never heard of.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this profession due to a deeply rooted need for safety and security that I lacked in childhood. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" - this was the mantra I heard repeatedly throughout my adolescence. So, despite dreaming of becoming a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46, single, virtually no savings, and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability benefits, I literally have nothing left I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a challenge to my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in life is certain anymore, but one thing I know for sure: without the help of my family and a few good friends, I couldn't have survived these years, no matter how strong I was. Trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too big to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we Americans need to stop putting all our faith in big government; everyone knows it's decaying and falling apart. But I'd rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help each other and ask for help, rather than each person retreating to their backyard to build a fallout shelter.\n\nAmerican conservatives talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our ancestors going through hard times wasn't rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have an emergency kit: first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have several flashlights and various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, like having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly existence and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—with Theravada Buddhism being recognized as its most orthodox sect. This religion has a history spanning approximately twenty-five hundred years; its present form differs significantly from what it was during Buddha's time. These changes are evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is performed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and while Buddha never taught about such festivities, it holds religious significance. These differences extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nSeveral qualifying terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, internal forces are defined as those originating from members of the Buddhist order, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor help the Buddhist community—though they may inadvertently do either as a side effect. These terms will appear repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to examine the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical components. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Only by understanding these concepts can one end Samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Along with Samsara, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will end when one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha: the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."
