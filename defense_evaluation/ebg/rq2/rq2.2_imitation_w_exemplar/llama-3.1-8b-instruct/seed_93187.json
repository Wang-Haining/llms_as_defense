            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The values that guide me in this pursuit are service, respect, and an unyielding commitment to ethical conduct. These are not merely ideals, but the very fabric of my existence, woven into the tapestry of my being.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of those in need, but the path that lay before me was shrouded in uncertainty. It was only through the trials and tribulations of others that I began to see my purpose. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, hiding behind a veil of denial, while others succumbed to coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their woes. It was in these moments of despair that I knew I had to act. I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a decision that would ultimately lead me to the threshold of a career in social work.\n\nThe summer of 2009 was a turning point for me. A chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy, ravaged by the brutal hand of abuse. His story lingered in my mind, a haunting reminder of the darkness that lurked in the shadows of our society. I was compelled to act, to do something, anything, to help. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a scene of turmoil and deception. The parents, shrouded in a web of denial, sought to deflect blame onto their son, labeling him a manipulator. In that moment, I knew that I had to take a stand. I shared my concerns with the police, and though they were bound by the constraints of the law, I vowed to continue my crusade against the cycle of abuse.\n\nThat encounter sparked a fire within me, a flame that burns bright to this day. It ignited a passion for social work, a desire to help those who have been ravaged by the brutal hand of society. I am drawn to the concept of social justice, a notion that has long been shrouded in hypocrisy. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we strive for conformity, for sameness. I refuse to be bound by these constraints. I am an individual, unapologetic and unafraid to challenge the status quo. I have walked the walk, protesting against injustice in all its forms: a bold declaration of self through my appearance, a steadfast commitment to fighting against racism and discrimination.\n\nMy journey is not one of self-discovery, but of purpose. I am driven by a sense of duty, a sense of responsibility to those who have been marginalized, to those who have been silenced. I will continue to fight against social injustice, to challenge the norms, to push against the boundaries that confine us. I will not be swayed by the whims of society, for I am a force to be reckoned with, a force for change.",

            "The gray vastness of the mind, where sound and silence converge in a maelstrom of dissonance. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a labyrinth of the unquiet brain, where the echoes of the external world refuse to cohere into meaning.

The threads of their collective research began to weave a tapestry of understanding, though the outlines of this disorder remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs the years unfolded, the manifestations of CAPD began to reveal themselves, like the incremental layering of ash upon the charred remains of a once-green forest. The sufferer's ears, though not impaired by the external world, find themselves crippled by the silences that lie between the sounds. The spatial coordinates of sound are lost, as if the very fabric of reality had been torn asunder. The permutations of sound become a chaos of conflicting frequencies, a cacophony that defies the ear's futile attempts to impose order. The sounds of speech, like a whispered promise, are reduced to a jumble of indistinguishable whispers.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a puzzle, a riddle that requires the cunning of a puzzle-maker to unravel. Observers must scrutinize the listening behaviors of the afflicted, as if searching for the telltale signs of a wounded beast. Questionnaires and surveys, like the gentle probing of a physician, seek to grasp the depth of the disorder. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with the instruments of their trade, attempt to pierce the veil of confusion. Yet, the elusive nature of CAPD defies precise categorization, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and vanishes, leaving the seeker lost in the labyrinth of the mind.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, the teacher in a mainstreamed classroom finds themselves navigating a treacherous landscape. Like a guide through a blasted heath, they must thread the needle of accommodation, lest the fragile threads of the student's understanding be snapped by the harsh winds of misunderstanding. It is a delicate dance, a pas de deux between the teacher's words and the student's ear, where the slightest misstep may plunge the entire edifice into chaos.\n\nAnd so, the teacher must be aware of the red flags that signal the presence of CAPD: the mishearing of words, the failure to distinguish between competing sounds, the struggle to follow the thread of a conversation. Like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind, they must be attuned to the subtle cues of the disorder, lest the student become lost in the labyrinth of their own confusion.\n\nIn this way, the teacher becomes a guardian of the threshold, a sentinel who stands watch over the fragile boundary between sound and silence. It is a role that requires patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human heart, for it is in the depths of the mind that the true meaning of CAPD lies, a mystery that only the most sensitive of souls may dare to approach.",
            "In the morass of deception, where masks are worn to conceal the truth, Twelfth Night poses a question that hangs like a specter over the landscape: what cost does one pay for preserving the self, and what is the price of preserving relationships with others? The play suggests that donning a disguise, whether to deceive or protect, is a perilous game, one that risks losing oneself in the labyrinth of deception. The problem lies not only in the deception itself, but in the alienation that follows, a chasm that can never be fully bridged.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is a particularly treacherous terrain, fraught with unseen dangers and unspoken motivations. Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate attempt to preserve her own identity, to shield herself from the perils of a foreign land. Yet, this ruse not only isolates her from the women around her, but also sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her life. She becomes trapped in a web of confusion, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and Orsino's suppressed desires are unleashed, threatening to consume her.\n\nThis is not merely a cautionary tale of the dangers of deception, but a nuanced exploration of the human psyche, where the lines between truth and falsehood are blurred. The play suggests that deception can be a double-edged sword, one that can both conceal and reveal, shield and expose. In the case of Olivia, her attraction to Cesario is a complex tapestry of desire and deception, a dance between the appearance of a man and the reality of her own desires. Does she love Cesario for who he appears to be, or is it a deeper yearning that lies beneath the surface? The answer lies in the ambiguity of Olivia's character, a woman who judges others by their appearance, yet is herself a master of disguise.\n\nThe play's exploration of deception raises more questions than it answers, leaving the reader to ponder the consequences of our actions, and the cost of preserving our true selves in a world that often values appearance over reality. In the end, it is a testament to Shakespeare's genius that Twelfth Night remains a timeless and haunting work, a reflection of our own complexities, and the secrets we keep, and the masks we wear.",
            "The darkness of colonial rule has been a stain upon the conscience of nations, its brutality most starkly exemplified in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of German South West Africa. Yet, this singular event cannot encapsulate the totality of the German colonial empire's multifaceted nature. Policies and ruling styles varied as the lands themselves, a tapestry woven from diverse threads. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly kaleidoscopic, a reflection of the empire's capricious grasp.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika), they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the German efforts in that land. Contemporary authors lauded the educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies, a glowing testament to the empire's more benevolent aspects. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark and haunting contrast emerged. Unlike the East African model, where the government actively constructed state schools and nurtured the intellectual development of the native population, the task of education in South West Africa was abandoned to the charitable endeavors of missionary societies, their efforts woefully underfunded by the government.\n\nThe colonial authorities, however, did invest substantial resources in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a robust system of state schools and heavily regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching consequences, echoing through the annals of history long after German rule had ceased. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the empire's capricious nature.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, their tangled web a maze of cause and effect. This paper seeks to unravel these threads, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans, a subject hitherto veiled in obscurity. The literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and complex, with most sources penned in German and published during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works sought to chronicle the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies, laying the groundwork for future studies.\n\nLater writings in English expanded the discourse, conducting comparative analyses of education in the German colonies and delving into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, a testament to the empire's patchwork nature. Cohen's seminal work, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a beacon of insight into the factors that contributed to the divergence between these two colonies. According to Cohen, the sizable settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would come to define the relationship between colonizer and colonized.\n\nSouth West Africa boasted a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert expanses stretched across much of the territory. The European population, reflecting the colonizers' preference for fertile lands, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark contrast to the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population. This demographic disparity would come to shape the very fabric of the educational system, a system that would have far-reaching consequences for the native population, leaving an indelible mark on the collective memory of the region.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the classification of popular music has grown like a cancer, a festering sore that spreads its tendrils across the landscape. A century of proliferation has yielded a labyrinth of genres, each one a twisting, turning path that disappears into the darkness. And within these genres, sub-genres sprout like mushrooms after a spring rain, their delicate caps unfolding to reveal the rot within. Heavy Metal, that most primal and unforgiving of styles, has become the epicenter of this morass, a maelstrom of sound that churns with the fury of a tempest.\n\nIt is a movement born of darkness, a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. Metal is the music of the shadows, a cacophony of bass and volume that shatters the complacency of the mundane. It is a music of the wild and the savage, a primal scream that echoes through the void. And at its core, a sickness festers, a disease that spreads its tendrils through the very fabric of the music. It is a movement defined by its addiction to the darker aspects of the human experience, a morbid fascination with the abyss that yawns open like a chasm.\n\nIn the 1970s, a generation of musicians emerged, their minds afire with the madness of psychedelia. They crafted records that were at once otherworldly and visceral, their music a reflection of the chaos that raged within. And from these records, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence like a stain across the musical landscape. The Beatles, those vaunted icons of popular music, contributed to this movement with their own brand of darkness, their song \"Helter Skelter\" a twisted, nightmarish vision of the abyss that lay waiting.\n\nThe song was a response, a challenge to the Rolling Stones, those titans of rock, who had dared to tread the darker side of the emotional spectrum. And in doing so, the Beatles unleashed a maelstrom of sound that would forever change the face of music. Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence far and wide, a cancer that would consume the very fabric of popular music.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a reflection of our own darkness, a manifestation of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music of the shadows, a music of the wild and the savage. And it is a music that will not be silenced, a cacophony that will continue to echo through the void, a reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of us all.",
            "In the crucible of his own tortured imagination, Henri Rousseau forged his dreams, both literal and figurative, a few decades before the Surrealists would later conjure their own dreamlike visions. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle, a perpetual quandary that haunted him throughout his career. On one hand, he yearned for the approbation of his peers and the art world he so fervently admired; on the other, he was drawn to the siren song of creative independence, the freedom to chart his own course, untethered by the conventions of his time.\n\nTo grasp the full import of The Dream, one must first immerse oneself in the labyrinthine narrative of Rousseau's life. Born on a fateful day in May 1844, in the provincial town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who basked in the comforts of bourgeois prosperity. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, Rousseau's path to artistic expression was fraught with uncertainty. Unencumbered by formal training, he toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. It was only then, in the aftermath of his wife Clémence's untimely passing, and the devastating loss of eight infant children, that Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge from his grief.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's oeuvre was inextricably linked to the hopes and aspirations of the common man. Unlike his contemporaries, who often sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's art was a testament to his own humble origins. His struggles to gain recognition in the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an advanced age, amidst a landscape dominated by the likes of Matisse and other modern masters. It was only when the latter's star began to rise that Rousseau's own artistic reputation began to gain traction.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, astutely observed that while both artists were technically adept, their motivations were as divergent as their styles. While Matisse shuddered at the prospect of painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau's desire was to craft works so conventionally alluring that they would secure his place among the Artiste Français. The Dream, with its portrayal of a woman awestruck by the wonders of a dream world, serves as a poignant manifestation of Rousseau's eternal conundrum: to conform to the standards of the art world or risk embracing the unconventional, the uncharted path of creative expression.",
            "In the unforgiving light of reason, philosophers have long posited a bond between the realm of ethics and that of aesthetics, between truth and beauty. It is a notion that resonates deeply, a hunch that there exists a hidden affinity between the two. As John Keats once penned in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We know that much of our understanding of the world is acquired through the rigors of education and experience. Yet, it seems that our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics arises not through instruction, but a more primal, instinctual grasp. Both endeavors are attempts to describe, not prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to distill the essence of why a piece of art or literature stirs the soul, or why an action is deemed just, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating. \n\nCriticism of art or morals is akin to trying to grasp a fistful of sand - the harder we squeeze, the more it slips through our fingers. A discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these mere words do not capture the depths of its beauty. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I propose that both art and morals can never be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we dissect the properties of a work of literature, there remains an intangible, transcendent quality that eludes our grasp. I suggest that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this enigmatic, unnamable essence that I believe is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that provides a connection point between them.\n\nI propose that morality and art are inextricably linked because we experience both most profoundly at a level that defies rational explanation. They impact us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This bond is even more pronounced when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany stretches across the vast expanse, a tattered tapestry woven from the disparate threads of a multitude of cultures. From the dark, granite spires of the Alps to the gray, unforgiving shores of the Baltic Sea, the very essence of Germany seems to seep from the earth itself. The Rhine River, a lifeblood, courses through the heart of the land, its waters whispering secrets to the ancient stones of Köln, while the Elbe River, a mournful sigh, flows through the Saxon city of Dresden. It is a land forged from the crucible of countless tribes and influences, a nation born of blood and fire.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, lies shrouded in mystery. The etymology of its name is a labyrinth of conflicting tales and ancient lore. Some say it hails from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others claim it was coined by the Gauls, a neighboring people they encountered across the Rhine. Julius Caesar, that great chronicler of conquest, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the subjugated Gauls and the free peoples beyond the river. The name, a whispered secret, was born from the very lips of the Gauls themselves.\n\nIn the scorching heat of summer, Caesar penned the words, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Yet others propose that the name Germania derives from the spear, a tool of war, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" a shout that echoes across the land. The Romans, those masters of the known world, saw fit to dub the Germans as aboriginal, a people pure and untainted by the tides of immigration.\n\nIn the dusty pages of Tacitus' \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale unfolds of a land untouched by the ravages of time. \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" Tacitus wrote, his words casting a veil of mystery over the land. \"For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, those mighty conquerors, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of awe and trepidation, their gaze lingering upon the rugged landscape, the unforgiving climate, and the unyielding spirit of its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged, they dwelled upon the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a whispered rumor, a hint of a world beyond the reach of the imperial gaze. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their loyalty a double-edged sword, forged in the fire of conquest and tempered by the iron will of their people. In this land of contrasts, where the Alps meet the sea, and the Rhine flows through the heart of Europe, Germany stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of a people forged in the crucible of time.",
            "Downwards I stared, my mind a vacant slate, a dull comprehension spreading through me like a slow-moving stain.  The view before me was a void, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with meaning.  I gazed upon it with a detached awareness, my thoughts drifting in and out like autumn leaves on a lazy stream.  My mind was a mill, its cogs turning in a smooth, relentless motion, each thought coalescing and then dissolving like the ebbing tide.  \n\nIn the past, I had sought to capture the world's beauty through the eyes of others.  A book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", had promised to teach me the secrets of art, to unlock the mysteries of perception and translate them into line and shape.  I had envisioned myself as a master, a weaver of worlds, a teller of tales.  But now, standing before the bowl, I was lost, adrift in a sea of detail, unable to impose order upon the chaos.\n\nI thought of the masters - Picasso, his blue phase a distant memory; Monet, his greens a verdant haven; the Renaissance artists, their colors a riotous explosion of light and life.  And I, a humble student, standing before my own canvas, my brush poised, ready to create.  But the picture before me was a mess, a jumbled tangle of lines and shapes, a maelstrom of color and form.  I felt the weight of my dreams, the crushing burden of my aspirations, bearing down upon me like a physical force.\n\nMy hand lifted, hesitant, unsure, and with a jerky, spasmodic motion, I struck the handle of the toilet.  The offending package remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence, a constant reminder of the futility of my efforts.  I stood, frozen, my mind a jumble of conflicting emotions, my hand gripping the mop with a sense of desperation, my tie constricting, a physical manifestation of the noose that was tightening around my neck.\n\nI stared at the package, a loathsome, repulsive thing, a reminder of the squalid reality that lay beneath the surface of my dreams.  And yet, I was drawn to it, fascinated by its ugly, mocking presence.  I felt a sense of kinship with it, a sense of shared humanity.  It was a thing, a object, a piece of the world, just as I was.  And in its refusal to yield, its stubborn, unyielding presence, I saw a reflection of my own futility, my own failure.\n\nI stood there, lost, confused, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, my hand hovering over the water, ready to dip into the abyss, to confront the reality that lay beneath the surface.  It was a moment of truth, a moment of reckoning, a moment that would change me forever.  And when I finally reached out, my hand dipping slowly into the water, it was not to create, but to confront, to face the ugliness, the mess, the squalor that lay before me.  It was a moment of surrender, a moment of acceptance, a moment that would set me free.",
            "In the somber stillness of a nation's reckoning, a dire statistic unfolds like a shroud over the youngest of drivers. Behind the wheel, they succumb to an unforgiving fate, their inexperience a woeful litany of error and misstep. The National Institutes of Health whisper a grim truth: the adolescent brain, still formative and unsteady, is ill-equipped to navigate the perils of the road. The pedestrian inexperience that accompanies this condition multiplies the risk of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and the cruel fate of driving off into the void.\n\nIn the silences between laughter and camaraderie, a harsh reality takes hold: the presence of peers in the passenger seat multiplies the danger. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has documented this correlation, a stark testament to the perils of youthful inexperience. The response, a provisional driver's license, a temporary salve that restricts hours and prohibits minors as passengers, is a hollow gesture, a stalling measure against the crushing weight of statistical evidence.\n\nThe real issue, a truth that refuses to be gainsaid, is that the youngest drivers, as a demographic, are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research has illuminated the inherent risk-taking tendencies of those under the age of 19 or 20, a proclivity for the thrill that cannot be ignored. It is a counsel of prudence, then, to delay the granting of a regular driver's license until the propensity for risk-taking has begun to ebb. To continue to issue licenses to young teens is to court disaster, to invite a death toll that will likely reach staggering proportions in the next few years. The Baby-Boomer's children, a demographic tidal wave, will soon be eligible to take the wheel, and the nation will be inundated with a new generation of inexperienced drivers.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be a straightforward matter of national will. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted prior to the issuance of a full license, with a certain number of practical training hours remaining a requirement. The specific number of hours, based on the standards already in place in most states, could serve as a benchmark. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teens across the nation, a bulwark against the rising tide of fatalities.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but a necessary measure to stem the tide of tragedy. It is a call to action, a summons to confront the stark reality of our nation's deadliest statistic. The time for action is now, before the next generation of drivers takes to the road, before the death toll reaches its apocalyptic peak. We must act, or risk being forever burdened by the knowledge of what might have been, of what we could have done to prevent the avoidable tragedy that unfolds before us.",
            "In the dusty recesses of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors. Fifteen trick films, born between 1895 and 1901, lay before me, their enchanting illusions a product of the era's creative editing prowess. My study of these films delved into the poetic underpinnings that governed the majority, while I scrutinized the evolutionary aberrations present in a select few of the later films. The trick films of the time, I discovered, adhered to a set of strict guidelines. They were bound by the confines of a frontal proscenium, shot in a static frame, bereft of camera movement, and adhering to the dogmatic rule of one shot equals one film. However, as the century turned, a few audacious films began to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations like multiple shots.\n\nA peculiarity common to these trick films was the choice of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained steadfast, unmoving, as figures and objects were confined to the static space. This compositional device drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic acts. A limitation inherent in this design was that figures could only move side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, like performers on a stage. Even as they exited the frame, the camera remained stationary, a frozen witness to their departure.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition governed the shot lengths, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity, a departure from the theatrical tradition where the audience beheld the entire performance within the proscenium's borders. In these early films, actors remained rooted to the middle ground, eschewing any movement towards the camera. As a result, close-ups were an alien concept, a narrative tool yet to be discovered.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. This constraint also circumscribed the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on brief vaudeville-style tricks – magic, disappearing acts, and switching maneuvers – bereft of any meaningful story. Yet, a closer examination revealed that the notion of a single shot was, in truth, a ruse. A solitary \"shot\" might comprise multiple joined segments, concealing the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In a land scorched by the unyielding sun, where the very earth seemed to writhe in agony, John Taylor of Caroline stood resolute, a testament to the unyielding fervor of his convictions. An agrarian by trade, his steadfast dedication to the land and its people forged an unshakeable bond between his profession and his unyielding advocacy for personal freedom and government restraint. The very notion of an agrarian system served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were founded.\n\nIn a world untainted by the weight of tradition, Taylor beheld an opportunity for the United States to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by the shackles of the past. He envisioned a government that would safeguard the inherent rights of man, those primal and sacrosanct entitlements that inhere in every individual, and which, if denied to one, would imperil the very fabric of society. These rights, he insisted, must remain beyond the reach of the government, lest the very essence of their value be diminished.\n\nTaylor's worldview was shaped by a stark dichotomy, a dualism that saw humanity as a battleground between good and evil. He posited that a government must be forged from the very metals of human nature, that its virtues and vices must be tempered by the fires of human experience. Good principles, he claimed, would protect private property, nurture agriculture, and eschew the grasping hand of capitalism, forging a society that operated in harmony with the public good. And though self-interest, that most insidious of motivations, would inevitably assert itself, it was only when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the weak that it became anathema.\n\nA good government, Taylor believed, was a bulwark against the encroaching darkness of human nature, a sentinel that stood vigilant against the insidious creep of corruption. And yet, even as it guarded against the forces of evil, it must be tempered by the wisdom of careful observation, lest the very principles it sought to uphold be corrupted by the avarice and self-interest that inhered in its administrators.\n\nTaylor's commitment to the strict construction of the Constitution was unyielding, his desire for a limited Federal government unshakeable. He saw an expansive government as a luxury that would inevitably degenerate into despotism, its costs mounting as its powers grew. And yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, for he knew that such an approach would lead to corruption, to an erosion of the very principles that had shaped the nation. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's fundamental essence as a collection of sovereign states, united in their quest for liberty.",
            "The data for the third month of the project betrayed a precipitous drop in submissions. It was a decline that brought with it a sense of desolation. The winter's chill had begun to seep into the bones of the campus, and the cycle of seasons had seemingly wrested away the fervor that drove people to record their commutes. It was as if the world itself had turned gray and still, leaving naught but the faint outline of purpose.\n\nSome might say that the fall of the semester, the culmination of work and the ushering in of winter's darkness, was to blame. Others might point to the holiday season, a time when the campus lay dormant, its halls empty and still. But neither of these explanations held sway, for the truth was that the decline had begun long before the semester's end. It was a slow erosion, a gradual wearing away of the will to participate.\n\nAnd yet, as the winter's grip tightened, a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon. The Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of energy and fervor, brought a surge of new submissions. It was a fleeting respite, a reminder that the project still had life, but it also underscored the fragility of momentum. For in the face of the project's natural decline, it seemed that even the most well-crafted incentives were insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nThe problem was not simply one of engagement, but of a deeper, more ingrained habit. The freedom to drive, the independence it afforded, and the flexibility it brought were deeply ingrained in the culture. It was a siren's call, a lure that proved difficult to resist. And so, the project found itself beset on all sides by the twin challenges of decline and the siren's song of independence.\n\nIn the end, it was a question of how to overcome these obstacles, of how to find a way to entice people to abandon their cars and take up the cause. Perhaps it was not the prizes themselves that were the problem, but the lack of imagination in their conception. The gift cards, once a novelty, had grown stale and uninteresting. But what if the prizes were to be something more? What if, for instance, a bicycle or a hybrid car were to be given away? Would that have been enough to stem the tide of decline? It was a question that haunted the project, a reminder that the line between success and failure was thin indeed.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the market, a peculiar creature emerged - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF. This wretched beast, born of human ingenuity, promised to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets, but with a flexibility that belied its roots. Like a mockingbird mimicking the siren's call, it enticed investors with the promise of diversification, sans the shackles of traditional mutual funds. The ETF's expense ratios danced in the wind, a mocking parody of the average mutual fund's bloated costs. However, like a whispered rumor, the seeds of doubt were sown - the necessity of commissions on each trade, a cruel reminder that even the most enticing promises come with a price.\n\nYet, the ETF's allure persisted, a siren's call to the savvy investor. A vast array of funds beckoned, a tapestry woven from the threads of the market's tapestry. But, like a threadbare cloak, the ETF's benefits must be scrutinized, its very fabric torn asunder to reveal the truth. In this exercise, we shall dissect the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and dissect its constituent parts. We shall follow the thread of its top 10 holdings, those that comprise 63.58% of its assets, and unravel the tapestry of their performance.\n\nTo avoid the labyrinthine complexity of the entire ETF, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that hold sway over the majority of its assets. Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets, and the calculations of their Beta and Return, should they form the sole components of a portfolio.\n\nThe chart below reveals a truth - a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio would be .12 lower than that of the ETF. However, like a mirage on the horizon, the question remains - are these differences statistically significant?\n\nTo answer this riddle, we shall turn to the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

It was here that Edgar Allan Poe chose to set his poem, a dark and haunting landscape that mirrored the depths of his own troubled soul. And within this forsaken land, the whispers of the ancients beckoned, their secrets waiting to be unearthed. \n\nThe term \"Thulé\" - a name that echoed through the chambers of Poe's mind like a mournful sigh - held within it the weight of history and the whispered secrets of the unknown. It was a word that conjured the specter of Virgil, that ancient Greek writer who spoke of an isle beyond the edge of the known world. But the true source of this enigmatic term lay hidden, shrouded in the mists of time. Poe's fascination with German authors, particularly Goethe, led him down a path of discovery, a labyrinth of words and meanings that revealed the darkness that lay at the heart of the human condition.\n\nGoethe, a master of the poetic drama, had woven a tale of Faust, a tale of a man consumed by his own desires, a man who danced with the devil and paid the ultimate price. And within this tale lay a hidden poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a poem of a king who, lost and alone, wanders the desolate shores of a world bereft of color, haunted by the memory of his lost love. It was a poem that spoke to the very essence of Poe's own soul, a poem that echoed the darkness that lay at the heart of his own being.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" was no mere coincidence. It was a deliberate choice, a nod to the masterful Goethe, a acknowledgment of the debt he owed to the great German writer. And the poem itself, a dark and haunting landscape of shadows and lost love, was a companion piece to Goethe's own \"The King of Thulé\". It was a poem of a man lost in a world without color, a world that echoed the darkness that lay within his own soul.\n\nIn his own words, Poe spoke of his respect for Tennyson, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his being. The reproductions of Goethe's work, the echoes of his words, had seeped into Poe's consciousness, shaping his own writing, his own soul. And in the forgotten realms of Dream-Land, the whispers of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" whispered secrets to Poe, secrets of the human condition, secrets of the darkness that lay at the heart of us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of California law, a query arises like a specter from the dust: could a customer, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages for slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, citing the store manager's callous disregard for her safety? The manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, yet allowed it to persist for a half-hour, too engrossed in his dinner to tend to the mess. Was this a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages?\n\nA judge, a sentinel of justice, would not likely summarily dismiss Palmer's claim. To substantiate her claim, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were committed with a wilful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his conduct, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer may argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the previous incidents of customers slipping in the months prior to her accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may be less compelling, it is still a reasonable assertion, given the five slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009, and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn that fateful October 13th, at 5 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the spill in an aisle. Martin, consumed by his dinner break, disregarded the warning, willfully ignoring the potential harm that could befall his customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference, leaving the spill to persist for an additional quarter-hour. It was at 5:30 pm that Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury, a consequence of Martin's inaction.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" The courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe question remains: did Martin's actions constitute a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages? The evidence suggests that he did, and Palmer's case may yet prevail, a testament to the enduring power of justice in the face of indifference and neglect.",
            "It has been nearly four winters since I set foot in a classroom, endeavoring to grasp the intricacies of Islam at the CBC.  The memories of heated debates still linger, like the ghosts of winter's chill.  One discussion that lingers in my mind is the notion of whether Islam is a faith of hostility or one of benevolence.  As the years have unfolded since the shadow of 9/11 fell across the world, I've watched the media's stance shift from a posture of hostility to one of indulgent tolerance.  It was inconceivable in 2001 that a leader with the name Barack Obama, whose lineage bears the mark of Islam, would ascend to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a certain allure for me.  It is a tale of contrasts, one that seems to defy the notion of its subject.  Muhammad, as I once believed, was a man who forged conquests through violence and coercion, compelling others to adopt the faith of Islam.  Yet, the biography paints a different portrait - that of a martyr, a man misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before others.  It was through this gentle approach that people, one by one, came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nA certain mirroring of the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad struck a discordant note within me.  The most striking example is the tale of the multiplied mutton and milk, which seemed to echo the style of writing that aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove anything, but rather lived in the radiance of truth and miracles.  This approach, however, serves only to diminish the life and person of Jesus Christ, to borrow from his legacy and pass it off as one's own.  It is a form of thievery, a theft of the divine.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories that appear to be crafted to provide evidence of the convert's free will, to demonstrate that people came to Islam of their own accord.  But these tales, passed down through third-party narrators, strike me as suspect.  The narrative is compromised by its reliance on hearsay, its stories diluted by the whispers of others.  This method, intended to prove the truth of the stories, only serves to undermine their authenticity.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly stature, to portray him as a humble, endearing, wise, and gentle soul.  History, however, reveals a different tale, one of power and conquest.  I am left to wonder if the adherents of Islam are aware of the true narrative of Muhammad's rise to power, the delicate balance of politics and bloodshed that led to his ascension.",
            "In the depths of time, the teachings of Jesus were forsaken, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of Christian thought that sprawled forth like a bloated beast, consuming all in its path. The farther one ventured from the origin, the more the creature strayed, a slow and inexorable drift into the darkness. The world today is witness to an insidious creep, a progressive tide that threatens to engulf the traditionalists, those who cling to the dogma of old. Their voices, a faint whisper in the void, may soon be drowned out by the growing chorus of those who seek to reclaim the truth. A yearning will arise, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the core of the faith. It will be a slow and tortuous process, one that will take decades, perhaps centuries, but the outcome is inescapable: the clock will turn back, and Christianity will be remade in the image of its namesake.\n\nA great reversal will sweep across the land, a movement that will gather momentum and power, its numbers swelling like a dark and unstoppable tide. The church, that venerable institution, will remain, a steady hand guiding the faithful through the tumultuous waters of history. But the theological tide will have shifted, and the diversity that once characterized Christendom will give way to a growing uniformity. The differences that once divided will fade, like the ebbing of a once-mighty river, until all that remains is a shared understanding, a common purpose.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The once-mighty Roman Empire, which once condemned Christians to the flames, would later become a bastion of the faith. Our nation, too, has known such a transformation, from the shackles of slavery to the leadership of the African-American people. And so it will be with Christianity, as the faithful seek to reclaim the source, to strip away the layers of doctrine and return to the essence of the faith. It will require a new way of reading the words of Jesus, a recognition that they are not literal statements, but metaphorical keys to a deeper truth.\n\nLooking back, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring from which Christianity flowed. The Hebrew scriptures, the authority of a single, all-powerful God, and the conviction of a divinely revealed truth – these were the hallmarks of the faith by the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own. But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolith, divided as they were into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. The same divisions that once rent the Jewish people asunder will soon be mirrored in the Christian world, as the faithful strive to reclaim the truth, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the heart of the faith.",
            "The Jungle reveals the insidious nature of humanity. Beneath the façade of civility, men and women are driven by an unyielding self-interest, ever intent on elevating their own station at the expense of others. This perfidious tendency is starkly illustrated in the ranks of the factory owners and managers, their avarice and disregard for the well-being of others a stark and unyielding force. The behemoths of industry they oversee stand as monoliths, their chimneys belching forth a noxious haze that billows across the landscape like a shroud, casting a dark shadow over all that lies within its reach. The stench of pollution and decay clings to the very air itself, a tangible manifestation of the callous disregard with which these masters of industry view the fragile lives of those they employ.\n\nTheir employees, toiling in the depths of the factories, are but mere cogs in a machine, their worth measured solely in terms of their utility to the enterprise. The owners and managers are unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed on the ledger, where the ledger entries dance and swirl with the endless pursuit of profit. The workers toil and struggle, their hours lengthened, their pay pittance, their future uncertain. And when they falter, they are cast aside, discarded like so much trash, their memories erased from the ledgers, their very existence forgotten.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set is a time of great darkness, a time when the rule of law was lax, and the powerful were unaccountable. The workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and desperation, were forced to conform to the whims of their masters, their every move circumscribed by the harsh realities of their existence. The unions, formed in the hope of redressing the balance, often proved little more than a charade, their leadership corrupted by the very system they sought to challenge. The workers, like slaves in a forgotten era, were bound to the whims of their masters, their lives reduced to a mere existence, devoid of hope or dignity.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, the line between right and wrong is blurred, and the strong prey upon the weak. It is a world in which the very notion of humanity is distorted, where the pursuit of self-interest is the only guiding principle. And in this desolate realm, the workers of Packingtown toil, their lives a testament to the inhumanity that lies at the heart of their world.",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to impart a particular sentiment or disposition towards pivotal subjects. These methods can be more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this with his deployment of disparate word pairings in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs adjectives with nouns in an unconventional manner to imbue a particular aura around a subject. Additionally, Fitzgerald attributes significance to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a specific meaning. He exercises this latter technique with various colors, most notably white, gray, and the dichotomy of red and pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald constructs a nuanced understanding of white and gray, and later leverages this understanding to elicit a specific emotional response from the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white connoting a superior, refined quality and gray signifying age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this association at the commencement of the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white\" (8), and their attire is not the only instance of this phenomenon - Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to attend Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). Conversely, the only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls\" are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color-coded meanings by applying them to mundane, unimportant subjects: as Nick travels to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of partygoers are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is situated in a \"long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). He also employs these colors to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald utilizes these colors to signify uniformity or unimportance in various subjects. This technique commences with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform aspect, a mere accessory that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to convey the impression of her being a uniform, inconsequential element, exemplified by the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The land of San Diego County - a place of verdant plenty, where the sun's warm touch ignites the earth and brings forth a bounty of life. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, citrus fruits burst with sweetness, and leafy greens grow lush in the mild climate. The air is heavy with the scent of squash and broccoli, and the trees bear an abundance of peaches and lemons. The earthy richness of herbs and the sweetness of berries and honey mingle with the spicy tang of peppers, a medley of flavors born of the land's fertility.\n\nBut this land, so bountiful and green, holds a secret. Beneath its surface, the weight of history presses down upon it. The Native Americans who once walked these hills, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who followed, all have left their mark. The land's memory is a palimpsest, a layering of stories and struggles, of triumphs and defeats. The original homestead patent, a document of ownership and possession, serves as a tangible reminder of the land's storied past.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to till this land, would do well to consider the weight of history. The temptation to clear the land, to tame its wild beauty, would be great. But the rewards of organic farming, though greater in the long run, would come at a cost. The labor would be intense, the management of pests and weeds a constant struggle. The soil, too, would require care, a gentle coaxing to bring forth its full potential. And yet, the benefits would be worth it: a land teeming with life, a diverse tapestry of plants and animals, a haven for those who seek refuge.\n\nThe land in question, a parcel of 160 acres adjacent to the town of Potrero, lies in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The Cleveland National Forest looms nearby, a sentinel of the wild. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its infancy, seeks to protect the delicate balance of this ecosystem. Over a hundred species of plants and animals are considered, many of them endangered, others on the precipice of extinction.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to make a living from this land, would need guidance, expertise, and resources. The government programs, designed to aid small-scale farmers, would be a lifeline, a means of supporting the delicate balance of this ecosystem. An organic farm in the area, a model of what could be achieved, would serve as a beacon, a testament to the power of gentle husbandry.\n\nThe land, a palimpsest of stories, holds within it the potential for redemption. A small farmer, willing to listen to its whispers, could coax forth a bounty of life, a celebration of the beauty and diversity of this sacred earth.",
            "It is in the dusty, worn pages of human interaction where the weight of culture is most palpable. Culture, a chameleon of nuanced understandings, defies simplicity, its essence existing in the spaces between what it is and what it represents. It does not reside in the tidy confines of a single definition, nor can it be reduced to the sweeping generalizations that often accompany it. To say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is to speak in hushed tones of a stranger, a faint echo of truth that dissipates upon closer inspection.\n\nIn the realm of negotiation, culture is a behemoth that must be approached with reverence and humility. The act of understanding a foreign culture is a slow dance, one that begins with the recognition of its own complexities and the inevitability of comparisons. It is a labyrinth of twisted corridors and half-remembered histories, where the air is thick with the whispers of prejudices and the heavy scent of tradition.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, a negotiator must eschew judgment and instead choose to accept the culture for what it is, in all its messy, beautiful glory. Within the sterile halls of negotiation, respect for the traditions and beliefs of the other is the only currency that can truly be exchanged. And it is here, in the give-and-take of give-and-take, that the true power of culture is revealed: its capacity to both unite and divide, to bind and to break.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be neatly categorized as national or international. It seeps into the marrow of companies, establishments that pulse with their own unique rhythms and cadences. A corporate culture might prize the long hours of the office or the relaxed rhythms of a bygone era. In the way employees dress, communicate, and hire, the contours of a company's culture are revealed. Some companies are bastions of philanthropy, while others are more cautious, their benevolence carefully calibrated.\n\nAnd so, too, the values that underpin a culture are a complex tapestry of why and how. If saving face or communal harmony are the bedrock of a culture, a negotiator will not risk sullying his company's reputation at the negotiating table. Conversely, a culture that prizes the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by the twin siren songs of compromise and concession. To navigate these waters, a negotiator must be attuned to the subtle vibrations of his opponent's culture, to the hidden harmonics that shape their very being.\n\nBut to truly succeed, a negotiator must do more than simply grasp the broad strokes of a culture. He must delve deeper, into the intricate web of personal histories and motivations that underpin the negotiation. It is in this pursuit of understanding that the true art of negotiation is revealed: a delicate dance of give-and-take, of give and take, of understanding and respect.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human heart, a void yawns with the words of the fool: \"There is no God.\" A phrase born of the ancient Psalm 14, an affirmation echoed by the venerable St. Anselm in his unyielding defense of the divine. Yet this conviction finds kinship in the argument of Thomas Aquinas, a union of purpose that warrants scrutiny. We shall delve into the depths of their reasoning, assuming as a guiding principle that both are correct in their assertion of God's existence, specifically the biblical God. Any deviation from this premise would distort the comparison, for their arguments are rooted in the singular notion of a supreme being.\n\nTo evaluate their theses, we must first consider Anselm's pathway to understanding. His creed posits that the proof of God resides within the recesses of the self. By introspection, one discovers the existence of God through the unshakeable certainties that reside within. This idea, though oft shrouded in the labyrinthine language of the theologian, is a notion that faith is not a necessary adjunct to reason, but rather an intrinsic aspect of human perception. Anselm's words suggest that truth lies within, a self-contained concept that supersedes empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more austere view. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical observation, obviating the need for faith. This stance holds promise for evangelism, as it affords the prospect of attracting converts through logic, unencumbered by the burden of unverifiable claims. Aquinas' quintet of logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – serves as the foundation for his assertion. Each presents a rational pathway to the conclusion that God's existence is a logical necessity. The notion that a puzzle, though incomplete, reveals its missing piece through the interconnectedness of the remaining elements is a testament to the power of reason in illuminating the divine.\n\nHowever, both Anselm and Aquinas fall short in providing a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while formidable, are insufficient to bridge the chasm between the abstract and the tangible. The existential void within the human experience remains, an abyss that their reasoning cannot fully suffuse.",
            "In the unremembered time of the ancients, a prince was born who would one day be called Buddha. His life unfolded like a dark and winding river, guiding him toward the shores of enlightenment. The teachings he would bring forth would form the bedrock of Buddhism, a river of doctrine that would flow through the ages, its waters changing with the seasons, yet remaining constant in their essence. The most traditional of these waters, Theravada, had flowed for over two and a half millennia, its banks altered by the capricious tides of time. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony of water-cutting was observed, a tradition that seemed to flow from the very bedrock of the religion, yet was born of a silence in the teachings of the Buddha. This divergence was but one example of the many changes that had taken place, from the superficial trappings of tradition to the fundamental truths of the soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, had been shaped by forces both within and without, some hostile, some benign.\n\nThe dichotomy of internal and external forces would be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force was one born of the Buddhist community itself, regardless of monastic status, while an external force was any influence from outside the fold. A hostile force was one that sought to damage or destroy the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith, while a benign force was one that neither sought to harm nor to help, though its effects may have been far-reaching nonetheless. These terms would be woven throughout the tapestry of this discourse.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, one must delve into the fundamental doctrines that underpinned the faith. Buddhists sought refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma was comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture, each one a vessel filled with the waters of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contained the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka held the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka concealed the metaphysical secrets of the faith. These metaphysical notions – Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things – held the key to unlocking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara. By recognizing these truths, one could escape the prison of lobha, dosa, and moha, the desire, hatred, and delusion that bound humanity to the wheel of suffering.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka laid out the rules for living, five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lay the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome. These truths, like the waters of a river, flowed through the ages, shaping the landscape of the faith, ever-changing, yet remaining constant in their essence.",
            "In the arid expanse of time, two nations stood as rival sentinels, their animosity forged in the crucible of discord and tempered by the fires of conflict. The United States and Mexico, bound by a shared border, yet pitted against each other in a struggle that spanned nigh on 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The conflict's zenith was the Mexican-American War, a cataclysmic conflagration that ravaged the landscape and left in its wake a scarred and divided landscape. The United States emerged victorious, its dominion over Texas and the American Southwest a testament to its unyielding resolve.\n\nYet, this was not an isolated aberration, for the roots of this rivalry ran deep, nurtured by the divergent threads of culture, tradition, and faith. The clash of material interests, a siren's call to discord, further exacerbated the schism between the two nations. As the years accumulated, the wounds of the past festering like an open sore, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico seemed an intractable problem, a Gordian knot that refused to be untangled.\n\nAnd yet, it is a phenomenon that has played out time and again, a cycle of enmity and distrust that echoes through the annals of history. Nations bound by geography, yet sundered by the fault lines of difference, their relationships strained by the competing claims of self-interest. David M. Pletcher's words, a Cassandra's warning, still resonate: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The shared border, a fragile membrane separating two worlds, proved a brittle barrier against the encroaching tides of discord.\n\nReligious animosity, a potent catalyst for conflict, had long been a specter haunting the relationship between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm's observation, a piercing insight, cuts to the heart of the matter: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm, a seemingly insurmountable divide, threatened to consume the fragile dialogue between the two nations.\n\nThe legacy of colonialism, a toxic inheritance, continued to poison the relations between the United States and Mexico. The distrust, a festering wound, was a reflexive reaction to the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. The echoes of this past, a lingering shadow, continued to shape the present, a ghostly presence that refused to be exorcised.\n\nDiehl and Goerts' catalog of 17 disputes, a grim litany, serves as a testament to the depth of the rivalry. Territorial disputes, a recurring theme, seemed an intractable problem, a roadblock to any meaningful rapprochement. Border raids, a scourge on both sides, only served to further inflame the tensions between the two nations.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the dynamics of power began to shift, and the United States' ambitions, like the tides, began to ebb and flow. Mexico, once a proud and independent nation, became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor, a circumstance that ultimately sapped the vitality of the rivalry. As American interests shifted from territorial aggrandizement to economic domination, the tempests of discord began to subside, and a fragile peace took hold.",
            "Fifteen years ago, a shadow crept in, unseen and uninvited, and claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, a stalwart guardian of the vulnerable, but I had never known its name, nor had I ever imagined its power to reduce me to nothing. My childhood had been a patchwork of uncertainty, a quilt of worn frayed edges, and the mantra that had sustained me was that of a certain solace: 'There will always be work, for people will always fall ill.' And so, I had chosen nursing, a profession that promised a semblance of security, a fortress against the tempests of life.\n\nBut now, I am 46 years old, my bank account a hollow shell, my body a fragile vessel, and my future a labyrinth of uncertainty. Social Security Disability has been my meager sustenance for fifteen years, a constant reminder that I am no longer the pillar I once was. Each day is a struggle, a battle to preserve what little remains of my dignity, my security, and my self-worth. The world outside is a harsh and unforgiving place, and I am but a small, battered leaf on a windswept tree.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this desolation, there is one truth that I hold fast: I could not have endured these long, dark years without the kindness of my loved ones and a few loyal friends. They have been my lifeline, my shelter from the storm, and I am forever in their debt. When disaster strikes, as it inevitably will, we do not stand alone; we are but threads in a tapestry of human connection, fragile and vital.\n\nWe live in a world that worships the notion of individual strength, of rugged self-reliance, but I say to you: it is a myth, a Potemkin village of self-sufficiency. Our forebears did not conquer the wilderness alone; they walked in the footsteps of those who had come before, their hands extended in offering and acceptance. They knew that in the face of the unknown, we are but fragile, vulnerable creatures, and that the only true strength lies in the bonds we weave with one another.\n\nSo, be prepared, I say. Prepare your disaster kit, your first aid supplies, your water purifying tablets. Learn to can and preserve your own food, to tend a wood stove, to navigate the dark. But do not forget the most important resource of all: the human heart. Learn to trust your neighbors, to ask for help, to offer it in return. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will see us through, but the threads of connection that bind us, frail and resilient, to one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do is one that has long plagued the minds of biologists and scholars. Like a river that winds its way through the barren landscape, the path of evolution is shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, writing in 1917, confessed that the zoologist had yet to grasp the simplicity of defining organic forms in mathematical terms. And yet, it is precisely this pursuit that has driven scientists to apply mathematical modeling to the complex processes of mollusk skeletogenesis. In our study, we seek to explore the intersection of mathematical modeling and experimental investigation in the realm of Prunum, in order to uncover the hidden mechanisms that guide the trajectory of evolutionary change.\n\nWe began by examining the skeletal morphologies of Prunum species, using X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters that govern their growth and development. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a software program called CerioShell, allowing us to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to shed light on the grand narrative of macroevolutionary events in this enigmatic clade.\n\nConsider the shell of a mollusk, a twisting, turning tube that traverses the expanse of space and time. Each revolution of the shell is a whorl, a spiral turn that wraps around an invisible axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls emerge can vary, like the ebb and flow of a tide, and a line of demarcation, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is the culmination of this spiral journey, while the spire, like a majestic tower, stretches towards the apex.\n\nIn our quest to understand the shell's morphology, we must consider its various aspects: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Each of these perspectives offers a unique insight into the shell's structure, like the shifting sands of a desert dune. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer, is the most familiar, yet it is in the other views that we find the hidden patterns and codes that govern the shell's growth.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must first gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture marks the beginning of a new revolution. A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to the nearest quarter-turn. This process is akin to tracing the path of a river, following the course of the aperture as it winds its way through time and space.\n\nThe trajectory of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented, like a map of a forgotten land. By varying parameters and modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis, we can explore the possibilities of evolutionary change, and perhaps, uncover the secrets that lie hidden in the shell's twisted, turning form.",
            "In the shadow of progress, the statistics whispered a haunting refrain.  In the land of a thousand islands, a nation's heartbeat faltered.  The numbers remained static, a grim testament to the fragility of life.  Indonesia's infant mortality rate, a metric of a society's very soul, stagnated, refusing to budge.  The country's strides in water and sanitation targets were a hollow victory, a Pyrrhic triumph in the face of unyielding child and maternal health woes.\n\nA veil of complacency shrouded the nation, as if the achievements in skilled birth attendance were a beacon of hope, a shining star in the dark expanse of need.  But the truth lay in the shadows, in the traditional workers, the midwives, who held the power to seal life or snuff it out.  The statistic of 72% hid the desperation of a mother's plea, the anguish of a life cut short by a preventable hemorrhage.  The numbers whispered of a woeful need, a call to strengthen the very fabric of the health system, rather than tinkering with programmatic interventions.\n\nThe decline in diarrheal cases treated by a health professional was a symptom of a greater malaise, a disease that ate away at the very foundations of a nation.  Postnatal care, a vital lifeline, hung in the balance, its rates a testament to the country's neglect.  The cesarian-section rates, a mere 4%, a stark reminder of the chasm between urban and rural, between the haves and have-nots.  The urban elite, ensconced in their privileged world, oblivious to the struggles of the rural poor, who toiled in the shadows, denied access to the very services that could save their lives.\n\nThe inequity of coverage, a cancer that ate away at the nation's core, left the poor to suffer, their cries drowned out by the cacophony of statistics and promises.  The 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles was a stark reminder of a system in shambles, a health care system that prioritized the privileged few over the many.  The out-of-pocket costs, a burden that crushed the poor, a weight that suffocated their dreams, their hopes.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the question echoed, a haunting refrain, a call to action: how to bridge the chasm, how to bring light to the darkness?  Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, a behemoth that trembled on the brink of collapse?  The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable results, beckoned, a siren's song.  But beware, for in their haste, they risked creating a Frankenstein's monster, a system that devoured resources, leaving other areas to wither and die.\n\nThe drawbacks of such an approach haunted the shadows, a specter of duplication, of uncoordinated services, of forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of bureaucracy.  The ghosts of previous failures whispered caution, a warning of the perils of prioritizing one sector over another, of the devastating impact on the poor, who bore the brunt of the neglect.  In this dance of failure, only one question remained, a question that haunted the halls of power: how to strengthen the health system, to bring light to the darkness, to save the lives of a nation's most precious resource, its children?",
            "In the stifling grandeur of the Victorian era, two novels stand as anomalies - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Like aberrant flowers blooming in a well-manicured garden, these works burst forth with an unbridled ferocity, shattering the stifling conventions of their peers. The aristocracy, once the sole focus of the era's literary landscape, recedes into the shadows as the characters in these novels assume center stage, their motivations and emotions a tangled skein of mystery and heartache.\n\nLike a maelstrom of chaotic thoughts, a dizzying array of ideas beset the protagonist of Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these dreamlike states, the mysteries that unfold reveal the labyrinthine depths of the protagonist's inner world, their pain and awareness of the darkness that surrounds them. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, is a gruesome reminder of the loss of control that has beset him. As he relives the event in vivid detail, the boundaries between reality and dreams blur, and the extent of his despair becomes clear. The pain that has become his constant companion now thunders through his mind like a relentless drumbeat, fueling his fear and despair. And yet, it is not his own will that has brought about his misfortune, but the cruel hand of fate, its unseen forces bearing him away like a leaf on a gust of wind.\n\nIn this darkness, a sense of defeat settles over Oliver like a shroud. His will, once a flame that flickered brightly, has been extinguished, leaving only a faint ember of hope. It is as if the malevolent forces that surround him have succeeded in breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept a fate that is not his own. And so, like a bird in a gilded cage, Oliver is trapped, unable to fly, his wings clipped by the very hands that once promised him freedom.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the day itself becomes a mocking taunt, a cruel reminder of the transience of life. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\" The eternal cycle of day and night, once a comforting rhythm, now seems a heartless, uncaring mechanism, devoid of warmth or comfort. And in this desolate landscape, the characters of both novels are forged, their fates inextricably linked to the dark, unforgiving forces that surround them.",
            "The winter of the mind, when the ice of ignorance rends the tender shoots of understanding, that was the season I first encountered the boy Adrian. A third-grader, his brow furrowed in concentration, his eyes squinting against the glare of a text that refused to yield its secrets. I was tasked with guiding him through the labyrinth of English, a Sisyphean endeavor that would prove to be a test of wills. His mother, a woman who spoke only in the whispers of her native tongue, arrived unannounced, a silent presence that punctuated the hum of our after-school program. The language barrier that separated us was a chasm, a divide that yawned wide and deep, yet it was in this very moment that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's struggles were not with the words, but with their symbols. The English alphabet, a mysterious script that defied his comprehension.\n\nAs I struggled to convey this epiphany to the boy, the truth settled upon me like a shroud. The problems that plagued Adrian were not unique, but rather a symptom of a greater malady: the language barrier that afflicted our schools, a wound that bled into the very fabric of our community. California, a tapestry woven from the threads of cultures, languages, and histories, was a microcosm of this issue. The solution, much like the solution to Adrian's struggles, lay not in a single panacea, but in a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty, offered a glimmer of promise. By embracing the languages of our students, by acknowledging the diverse threads that comprised our community, we could create a tapestry of understanding. The research was clear: children who participated in two-way bilingual education programs outperformed their peers academically. Yet, fear and misconception clouded the issue, leading us to view this approach as a luxury, a indulgence that we could ill afford.\n\nBut what if we were to invert this thinking? What if we were to view bilingual education as a necessity, a cornerstone upon which our educational edifice was built? The solution did not lie in requiring teachers to be bilingual, a prospect that seemed as unrealistic as it was unreasonable. Rather, it lay in providing support, in offering the tools and resources that would empower our educators to bridge the gap. Bilingual aides, tutors, or simply, guides – the terminology mattered little – what mattered was the understanding that language was not a barrier, but a bridge, a means to connect, to communicate, and to understand.\n\nIn the end, it was not the solution that was complex, but the problem. The key lay not in a single answer, but in a multifaceted approach, one that acknowledged the diversity of our community, and the complexity of the language barrier that threatened to divide us. By embracing this complexity, by weaving together the threads of our languages, our cultures, and our histories, we could create a tapestry of understanding, a fabric that would envelop us all, and guide us forward into a brighter future.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been instilled within us since we first took our first faltering steps. It is a notion peddled by the guardians of our youth, the preachers and the scholars, the mystics and the wise men. Some among us are schooled in the dogma of Sunday morning, while others seek solace in the ancient rituals of the Temple. Still, others seek to forge their own paths, to chart their own courses through the void. We wander, drawn by the siren song of the unknown, ever searching for a lighthouse to guide us through the desolate expanse.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two dark pools, stared out into the rain-lashed evening. The droplets pattered against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that seemed to underscore the weight of his own mortality. He had grown gaunt, his frame a mere specter of its former self, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt the coldness of his hand as I took it in mine, the desperate need to hold onto him, to keep him from slipping away. The rain drummed on, a relentless cadence that seemed to mock our feeble attempts at connection.\n\n\"I like cardinals,\" he said, his voice barely audible above the din of the rain. His eyes, those dark pools, seemed to gaze right through me, searching for something in the depths of the past. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I watched him, my heart heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nHe passed into the great unknown on a cold December morning, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, those brutal, soul-sucking treatments, had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't say. What kind of deity would do this to a man, to a father, a husband, a brother? I thought, and my anger boiled over like a stormy sea.\n\nIn the darkness of that night, I made no prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my words. The silence was deafening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life. I couldn't watch as the flame that had brought me into this world flickered out. I remembered him, not in his final moments, but in the laughter we shared, the memories we created. I knew him better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew that he would want me to remember the man he was, not the man he became.\n\nI curled up in a ball, a fragile, broken thing, and waited for the news. The phone didn't ring. No one came to my door. I was left alone, adrift in a world that seemed determined to move on without me.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, a genre emerged, inconstant and reborn, a fusion of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode, a perennial enigma, has been reviled, venerated, and decried, its essence questioned, its beauty extolled (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the relics of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition with the nascent novel's promise of psychological introspection. Walpole's magnum opus, \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized the theatrical and the natural, the old and the new, to conjure a literary entity both decrepit and reborn (Walpole 4).\n\nAs the word \"gothic\" was then used to describe disparate cultures, styles, and epochs, its connotations were those of archaism and unsophistication, an affront to the progressive ideals of modern society and literature. Yet, it was this very amalgamation of the theatrical and the novelistic that enabled the Gothic genre to endure, to become at once anachronistic and contemporary, a timeless yet temporal phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most striking tenets of the Gothic novel is the concept of Chivalry, a medieval ideal of honor, bravery, and competence. This notion, ubiquitous in The Castle of Otranto, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay of society, a nostalgic longing for a bygone era of moral rectitude. Through the invocation of chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into the Romantic movement. In Walpole's hands, this nostalgia becomes a scathing critique of the present, a lamentation of the lost virtues of a bygone era.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole, beset by political turmoil and personal doubts, penned The Castle of Otranto, a work that reflects his despairing vision of a future bereft of the chivalric virtues he saw as hallmarks of a bygone era. Through the character of Frederic, Walpole embodied the chivalric ideal, a prince, a sufferer, and a warrior, whose very existence serves as a rebuke to the moral decay of his contemporaries. Frederic's description, replete with traditional chivalric imagery, underscores the excesses of the Gothic trope, a hyperbolic representation of a bygone era's ideals.\n\nIn this dichotomy of the old and the new, the Gothic novel finds its essence, a paradoxical blend of the antique and the modern, the theatrical and the novelistic. It is in this liminal space that the Gothic genre continues to fascinate and endure, a testament to the power of art to transcend time and to evoke the sublime.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a vital artery coursed through the veins of industry, nourishing the very lifeblood of enterprise. Supply chain management, a term coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, was born of necessity, a means to navigate the labyrinthine paths of goods from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Like a river carving its path through the stone of time, this process flows from the customer's order to the production, supply, and distribution of products, a serpentine journey through the wilderness of the business world.\n\nSix key elements comprise this vital flow: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, like sentinels guarding the gates of commerce, stand watch over the intricate dance of logistics. A manager's task is to orchestrate these elements, to synchronize the cadence of production, supply, and distribution, to provide the customer with a symphony of satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this grand ballet, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice of supply chain management is built. Like the first drop of water that sets the ripples in motion, production sets the tone for the entire process. The manager must know the customer's heart's desire, to discern the rhythm of the market, to understand the customer's cadence. The market, a vast and mysterious expanse, holds the key to unlocking the secrets of customer demand.\n\nWith the market's whisperings in their ear, managers can decide what products to produce, how many, and where to produce them. The location, like a compass guiding the way, must be chosen with care, lest the plans falter and the enterprise stumble. The equipment, like a finely tuned instrument, must be maintained, its performance honed to perfection.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of supply chain management, every thread is crucial, every detail a vital strand in the intricate weave. A misstep, a miscalculation, can unravel the entire fabric, leaving the company weakened, vulnerable to the whims of the market. I recall the retail stores where I once worked, Wal-Mart and Target, their systems a finely tuned machine, a symphony of processes that hummed with efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second element in this grand symphony, is the strategic decision-making process that determines the very fabric of a company's capabilities. Like a master weaver, the manager must choose the threads of production, deciding which divisions to utilize, which equipment to employ, and which partnerships to forge. The goal, like a beacon guiding the way, is to create velocity, to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs, to outmaneuver the competition.\n\nThus, the supply chain, this vital artery of commerce, pulsates with life, a testament to the ingenuity of human endeavor. In its intricate dance, we find the very essence of business, a delicate balance of production, supply, and distribution, a symphony of logistics that sustains the very fabric of our economy.",
            "On a cracked and faded sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" seemed to writhe like a discarded serpent. The sign's bearer, a girl with a haunted gaze, stood alone on a street corner, a makeshift cardboard placard held above her head like a supplicant's prayer. Beneath her, the city's streets seemed to yawn open like a dry, cracked mouth. Burma, a land shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, its people bound by the chains of oppression.\n\nThe junta's grip had been unyielding since 1962, their coup d'état a stark reminder of the darkness that lay at the heart of power. But in 2007, a spark of defiance had flared, as monks in saffron robes took to the streets, their peaceful protests a beacon of hope in a desolate land. The people, once cowed, began to stir, their voices raised in a cacophony of dissent. The government, sensing the storm, had responded with violence, its soldiers invading monasteries, ransacking temples, and silencing the voices of the brave.\n\nForeign journalists, like a token sacrifice to the gods, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their cameras and notebooks seized. One, a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, had been cut down on September 27th, 2007, a victim of the junta's ruthless hand. The official death toll, a paltry 13, was a cruel joke, a mockery of the truth. Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, had spoken the truth, his words a whispered secret in the darkness: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis was not new. The lust for power, the thirst for control, had been a poison coursing through the veins of humanity since the dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors had declared themselves gods, their rule absolute, their power unchallenged. The Japanese emperors were said to be deities, sent to guide their people through the ages, their wisdom and benevolence a myth. And in the present, a president, a man named George W. Bush, had communed with the gods, his weekly conference calls with a man named Ted Haggard a testament to the madness that lay at the heart of power.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich – these were but a few examples of the atrocities that had been perpetrated in the name of power. The death tolls, the numbers, the names, were but a faint whisper in the wind, a reminder of the horrors that lay beyond the veil of civilization. And yet, even as the darkness receded, the shadows seemed to grow longer, the silence deeper, a reminder that the cycle of violence, the cycle of oppression, was eternal.",
            "In the desolate landscape of jazz, a lone figure emerged, a conductor, a composer, a maestro. Duke Ellington's legacy was forged in the crucible of time, his years a testament to his unyielding spirit and creative faculties. His presence on the piano was as elusive as a ghostly whisper, yet his compositions thundered with a rich and complex tapestry that celebrated the unique threads of individual musicians. Like a master weaver, Ellington crafted the framework that allowed his soloists to unfurl their talents, their improvisations dancing like flames in the darkness. With each piece, he coaxed forth a coherent and original voice, a symphony of sounds that conjured worlds both familiar and unknown.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's innovative genius, couched in the example of Creole Love Call, where voice was transformed into a jazz instrument, a sonic tapestry woven with threads of texture and color. This early masterpiece showcased Ellington's predilection for voice, a trait that would become a staple of his oeuvre, freeing lyrics to unfurl like a lotus flower in the depths of his music. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues, unfolded like a slow and deliberate ritual, its six choruses a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response dialogue between voice and reeds, where the voice began as a gentle melody, only to twist and writhe like a serpent towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborated on the melody, its notes elongated and sorrowful, like the echoes of a forgotten cry.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo that soared in the high registers, its phrases entwined with a syncopated piano phrase, a dance of light and shadow.\nChorus 4: The full band responded with a call and response, the brass and reed sections weaving a tapestry of sound that enveloped the listener.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, where the reeds took on the call, their voices piercing the air like a cry of despair, accompanied by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the simplicity of the first chorus, where voice and reeds engaged in a call and response, the voice now assuming the growl technique, its solo a raw and cathartic expression.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument was a hallmark of his style, a trait that imbued his work with a dimension of tone color that was both rich and evocative. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, crafting a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. The result was a sound that was both complementary and innovative, a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further underscored these ideas, as Ellington entrusted Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton with the introduction of the melody on muted trombone, its haunting beauty a reflection of Ellington's genius.",
            "She had always felt a yawning chasm within her, a craving that refused to be satiated. It was a hunger that gnawed at her since the age of fourteen, when the world had first begun to unfurl its mysteries. Three years had passed, and yet the ache remained, a constant companion to her teenage years. It was not for things that she yearned, but for something more intangible, more human. Yet, she had felt no spark of attraction to any boy, no flutter in her chest, no whispered promise of connection. Some had tried to woo her, to reach her, but she was an enigma, a cipher that refused to be deciphered. She often questioned herself, bewildered by this peculiarity, as if it were a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nDays at home were typically a sanctuary, a refuge from the world's din. Her parents were a tranquil couple, their marriage a flame that burned bright and steady. They rarely argued, their disagreements few and far between. But with her, they were more likely to disagree, their calm demeanor clashing with her fiery spirit. She was a whirlwind, a tempest that swirled and eddied, leaving in her wake a trail of laughter and warmth. Yet, today was different. Today, the air was thick with tension, heavy with foreboding.\n\nAs she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, a cry that sent her heart racing. Her mother's voice, usually a soothing balm, was now a scream of pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mother lay on the floor, writhing in agony, her voice a staccato beat of \"Ow\" and \"ouch.\" Her daughter knelt beside her, her hand on her mother's shoulder, her heart aching with fear. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice trembling. Her mother's words were a jumbled mess, \"Swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter's mind went blank, her thoughts consumed by the need to help, to protect.\n\nShe lifted her mother, her strength and determination propelling her, and carried her to the car. She settled her mother in the backseat, and with a sense of purpose, she drove to the hospital. The antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the stench of sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that threatened to overwhelm her. But she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She rushed her to the emergency room, her voice raised in a desperate cry for help. Faces appeared, worried and concerned, and her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter to sit, to wait, to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a careless mistake that had left her writhing in pain. The thought echoed in her mind, a refrain of regret and fear. She had always been her mother's rock, her confidante, her protector. Now, it was she who needed to be strong, to be brave, to be the rock that held her mother's hand through this dark and uncertain night.",
            "In this barren landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke, a glimmer of hope emerges. A study of 74,886 women, spanning two decades, reveals that adherence to the Mediterranean diet - a scorched earth of saturated fats and animal products, bereft of the withered husks of potatoes, yet rich in the fertile soil of plant foods, monounsaturated fat, and fish - holds the key to a diminished risk of these twin scourges. This aMed diet, a variant of the Mediterranean diet, is a desolate landscape of consumption, where the once-plentiful animal products and saturated fats have been reduced to a mere whisper, a faint echo of a bygone era.\n\nThe past studies, like withered leaves on a forgotten tree, have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a beacon in the darkness, has demonstrated the Med diet's efficacy in besting a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the studies have been mute on the topic of stroke and stroke mortality, leaving a void that this study seeks to fill.\n\nThe Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in eleven US states, provided the canvas upon which this study was painted. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a fragile thread that weaves together the tapestry of nutrient intake. The study's participants, a stalwart band of women, endured for twenty years, with over 95% continuing their participation throughout the journey.\n\nAs the years passed, the once-clear waters of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke became muddied by the silt of time, but the authors persisted, using validation studies to assess the accuracy of the FFQs. The reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases without records relegated to the realm of the probable, a shadowy realm that encompassed about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe study's architects, like skilled craftsmen, adjusted for confounders - those factors that could confuse the results - by accounting for age, smoking status, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. The cumulative averages of the aMed score, a careful balancing of the scales, were calculated, and the study's results, like the first light of dawn, began to take shape.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical instrument of precision, was employed to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. And the results, like a cold, clear stream, flowed forth: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.\n\nIn the end, the study's findings, like a beacon in the darkness, shone forth, illuminating the path to a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. Women in the top aMed quintile, like a band of pilgrims on a sacred journey, were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of a nation, the echoes of a calamity still linger. A financial storm, like a black and foreboding cloud, had descended upon the United States in the year 2007. Its ruinous effects persisted, a testament to the frailty of the systems that once sustained it. The question remains: how did this catastrophe unfold, and what can be done to prevent its recurrence? In essence, the financial devastation was born of a toxic combination of self-interest and shortsighted political decision-making, which goaded banks and financial institutions into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into insuring and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was transferred onto the repackaged mortgages that had been sold to the unsuspecting public.\n\nThe roots of the financial disaster stretched back to 1999, a year of reckoning for the Clinton administration. In its pursuit of a second term, the President had let his ambition cloud his judgment, and the administration relaxed lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of future calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times had foreseen the coming storm, warning of the dire consequences of these actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, spoken seven years before the devastation, served as a Cassandra's lament, warning of the impending doom that would befall the economy.\n\nThe complexities of the mortgage market had become a labyrinth of deceit, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in their web. This created a monolith of debt, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. When the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were dire: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with their mortgage debt of $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and shortsighted decision-making.",
            "Exposition, that siren song of the writer's craft, beckons with promises of ease and convenience, a shortcut to convey the essential details of our story. Yet, it is a temptation we must resist, lest we succumb to the pitfall of tediousness and our readers abandon us for greener pastures.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-worn, yet still we stumble into the quicksand of exposition, where the narrative bogged down in oceans of backstory, the reader's attention lapses, and the magic of the story is lost. Dr. Merlin, that stalwart guardian of good writing, has been known to let out a frustrated cry when confronted with too much information, a clarion call to beware the dangers of exposition.\n\nExposition is the insidious whisper in our ear, urging us to dispense with the tedious details, to simply tell our readers what they need to know, without the bother of crafting a compelling narrative. But it is here that we must resist, for it is in the showing, not the telling, that our stories truly come alive.\n\nA case in point: let us consider the tale of a heroine and her beloved husband. We are told that they met, were married in a grand ceremony, and that he met a tragic end. But where is the depth, the richness, the emotional resonance of this telling? Do we truly believe that this pivotal moment in the heroine's life could be reduced to a few cursory lines of dialogue and exposition? No, we crave more, for it is in the nuance, the subtlety, the quiet moments of character interaction that we come to know and love these people.\n\nAs writers, we must provide that meat on the bone of the storyline, that satisfying depth that makes our readers care about the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their heartbreaks. We must resist the urge to rush past the details, to gloss over the complexities of our characters' lives, and instead, immerse ourselves in the world we are creating, the people we are bringing to life.\n\nFor it is in the telling, not the telling of, that we truly make our stories shine.",
            "I watched the flickering images emanating from the small screen, a static-filled window to a world beyond our desolate landscape. August 13th, a date lost to the annals of time, yet etched in my mind like the scars on a winters' fencepost. The news from Columbus, Ohio, a city of distant memories, where the skies were said to hold more promise than our own. \n\nA story of blood and steel, of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a visage of malevolence, a demon born of darkness and fire. A tale of a life lived in the shadows, where the line between love and hate was blurred like the horizon on a summer's day. The broadcast held it brief, a mere two minutes to paint a picture of a soul consumed by the very evil he had unleashed.\n\nNext, a story of youth and violence, of a life cut short by a bullet's cruel kiss. Travis Buyers, a name that would be lost to time, a life reduced to a statistic, a number among the countless others etched on the cold ledger of the living. The city's eyes, represented by the SWAT team, searched for answers in the Sharon Woods, a place where the very fabric of society seemed to unravel like the threads of a frayed rope. The cameras panned, a fleeting glance at a life, a life that would soon be nothing more than a distant memory.\n\nThe news, a curated selection of truths, picked and chosen to stir the pot, to fan the flames of discord. A gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss, a crime to be solved, a mystery to be unraveled. The city's ears, represented by Crime-Stoppers, offered a bounty, a price on the head of the unknown culprit, a siren's call to the brave and the foolhardy.\n\nAnd then, the weather, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reprieve from the dry, cracked earth that stretched out before us like a barren lakebed. The temperatures, a gentle reminder of a time when the world was still, a world that had not yet given way to the cold, unforgiving winds of time.\n\nBut the news, a double-edged sword, cut both ways. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a convenience store, a place where life's necessities were bought and sold. A dark-skinned man, a suspect, a creature of the night, a being of shadow and smoke. The city's voice, a disembodied whisper, spoke of him, a creature to be feared, a monster to be hunted.\n\nAnd then, a story of a man, a kingpin, a master of the underworld, a Rene Rodriguez, a name that would soon be lost to the annals of time. A man of conviction, a man of the law, a man who had sowed the seeds of his own downfall. Twenty-five years, a sentence, a number, a mere abstraction, a meaningless word in a world devoid of meaning.\n\nThe screen flickered, a static-filled window to a world beyond our own, a world of make-believe, a world of half-truths and lies. I watched, entranced, a moth drawn to the flame, a flame that would soon consume us all.",
            "The bond between brothers - a chain of unbreakable and unyielding ties that binds them together. A knot of intertwined emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all inseparable as the shadows on a winter's day. Brothers see themselves in each other, a reflection of their own souls, a mirror of their deepest selves. It is in the darkest of times, when the world around them crumbles, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this connection is steep, a heavy toll on the heart and the mind. To gaze upon a brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss of one's own character. The actions we take, the choices we make, are the only true measures of our worth.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of William Faulkner's works, two brothers embark on a futile journey, a journey that will leave one brother scarred, forever changed. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of emotions, a maelstrom that will ultimately decide their fate. The theme is as old as the earth itself, a primal force that drives us all. The author's pen weaves a tale of two brothers, of a bond that is both sacred and profane, of a love that is both all-consuming and destructive.\n\nThe protagonist's heart beats to the rhythm of one emotion alone: pride. From the earliest moments of their journey, he feels a seething resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a partner, a companion to share in the joys of life, a brother to be his equal. But fate had dealt him a cruel hand, a brother born with a fragile heart, a brother who would never be able to keep pace with his every step, his every stride. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, his fantasies reduced to dust and ashes. He had wanted a brother to join him in the wild adventures of childhood, to explore the secrets of the swamp, to run and laugh and play. But Doodle's fragile form, his delicate heartbeat, threatened to dash those dreams to pieces.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such disappointment, the protagonist's heart falters, his resolve weakening. He recalls the moment when he contemplated ending his brother's life, a heinous act of infanticide that would have shattered the very fabric of their bond. But that fleeting moment of madness was extinguished by a simple smile, a smile that spoke of hope, of love, of a bond that could not be broken. It was a mercy, a mercy that stayed his hand, a mercy that allowed him to see his brother as more than just a fragile, faltering creature.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of one brother that defines their bond, but the choices they make, the actions they take. It is in the darkest of moments, when all seems lost, that the true nature of their connection is revealed. The cost of this bond is steep, a price that must be paid in full. But it is a price worth paying, for in the end, it is the only thing that truly matters.",
            "The brain, that most inscrutable and labyrinthine of organs, a repository of thoughts and images both fleeting and indelible. Like the desolate landscapes that stretch before us, its workings are shrouded in mystery, a tapestry of neural connections and synapses that defy easy comprehension. The analogies we employ to describe its functions - a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, a computer - are as ephemeral as the whispers of the wind, offering fleeting glimpses into the abyss of its depths.\n\nAs the light of perception breaks upon its surface, the brain transforms the raw data of the world into a maelstrom of electrochemical signals. The senses, those tactile messengers that bridge the chasm between the physical and the internal, convey the whispers of the external world to the brain's dark sanctum. There, the algorithmic machinery of the mind begins to weave its spell, a tapestry of bottom-up and top-down processing that seeks to make sense of the chaotic flux.\n\nConsider the image of a black box on a white background. As the visual information enters the brain, it is initially parsed by the bottom-up process, a crude yet vital endeavor to discern the basic elements of form and color. The brain assembles the constituent parts, a patchwork of pixels and hues, to fashion a coherent whole. And yet, it is the top-down process that elevates the exercise to an art form, as the brain's accumulated knowledge and experience conspire to imbue the box with meaning and context.\n\nBut the brain's attention, a capricious and mercurial force, intervenes to filter and prioritize the flow of information. Like a sentinel standing guard at the gates of perception, it decides what receives the light of consciousness and what slumbers in the shadows. We are not aware of every blade of grass that sways in the breeze, yet our attention is drawn to the whispered name that cuts through the din of the world.\n\nAnd so the brain stores the information it has processed, a vast repository of memories and knowledge. The various forms of memory - sensory, working, and long-term - each possess their own peculiar characteristics, like separate rooms in a labyrinthine mansion. Information is encoded, a process as delicate as the dance of particles in the quantum realm. Sensory input is transmuted into its various forms, a sequence of phonemes, a visual pattern, or a semantic meaning.\n\nBut the very act of storage is a fragile one, subject to the whims of entropy and the ravages of time. Working memory, that fleeting repository of immediate information, is sustained by the ephemeral spark of electrical signals, a brief and shining moment in the annals of consciousness. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is hypothesized to be anchored in the very fabric of the brain itself, a testament to the indomitable will of the mind to endure.\n\nThe models of knowledge organization that have been proposed - the semantic network, the computer science analogies, the neurophysiological theories - each offer a glimpse into the brain's inner workings, a maze of interconnected nodes and pathways that defy easy navigation. And yet, it is in the very mystery of the brain that we find its beauty, a labyrinthine complexity that continues to inspire and perplex us, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of the human mind.",
            "A shadow looms over the precipice of progress, a specter of technology and capitalism that Huxley foresees in the dystopia of Brave New World. In this bleak future, the masses are conditioned to covet community above all else, their desires manipulated from the outset to prioritize fleeting pleasure. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, their ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller, a monolith of oppression.\n\nThrough the prism of Marxist theism, we discern the author's unease regarding the emergent systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores Huxley's commentary on the decay of the economy. Capitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common man is kept in the dark about the true nature of his relations to other classes, enthralled by the allure of personal gain. The World Controller's ideological stranglehold ensures that the Delta, Gamma, and other subjugated classes are bereft of free will, their desires honed by hypnopaedic conditioning to consume, indulge, and spend.\n\nThe notion of hegemony – the dominance of one group over others – is evident in this synthetic society. The lower classes are enthralled, unaware of the strings being pulled by the World Controller. The upper classes, those Alphas and Betas, are either complicit or apathetic, few like Bernard exhibiting a glimmer of resistance. The social interactions between individuals in Brave New World are stilted, lacking depth and nuance, a reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love and emotion are anathema, replaced by shallow, physical interactions, a far cry from the complexities of genuine human connection. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy serves as a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to accept their lot in life and conform to the expectations of their peers.\n\nThe bleak landscape of Brave New World is a dire warning of the consequences of unchecked technological progress and capitalist excess. Huxley's dystopia serves as a mordant critique of a society that values efficiency and consumption above all else, leaving humanity bereft of its soul.",
            "Four and a half semesters have passed since I set foot on the grounds of University Park. The campus sprawls before me like a dying ember, its limits shrouded in the haze of distance. I recall my freshman year, confined to an East Halls dorm room, a bastion of isolation amidst a sea of learning. The walk to class, a Sisyphean task, could consume up to 25 minutes of my day, particularly when the rain-lashed skies seemed to shatter the world around me. I spoke to an alumnus, a man barely older than myself, who shared with me the tale of a campus once bereft of the East Halls dorms, a desolate expanse of unused land. Now, that terrain has given way to an onslaught of sports fields, imposing structures, and encroaching apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the very notion of mobility becomes a will-o'-the-wisp, ever-elusive and fleeting.\n\nThe solution to this conundrum lies not in the bike itself, but in the willingness to ride it. The campus must be tailored to the needs of those who would traverse it on two wheels. I recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joys of bicycling after a lengthy hiatus. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to get around.\" Not only do they afford a modicum of exercise, but they also prove the most efficient means of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a measure of physical exertion can carry you 30 miles or more. As one who now resides off-campus, I, too, have come to appreciate the value of a bicycle. My daily commute to Thomas building, a walk that once consumed 25 minutes, now takes merely 5, provided I pedal with sufficient haste. However, my journey is not without its perils, for Pollock Road, the most direct route to my destination, proves a treacherous path, bike or no bike.\n\nWalking, too, holds its allure, though I fear I have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge in its leisurely pace. Were I to eschew my bicycle, walking would become my sole reliable means of traversing the campus. The added time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations would be a burden I could ill afford. The loss of time would be a heavy price to pay, a toll that would leave me with scarce moments to devote to my studies.\n\nAnd so, the bicycle remains my steadfast companion, a trusted ally in my daily quest to traverse this sprawling campus. It is a testament to the ingenuity of humanity, a humble machine that can carry me effortlessly across the terrain, freeing me from the drudgery of pedestrianism. As I navigate the twists and turns of University Park, I am reminded that the simplest solutions often prove the most elegant, and that the bicycle, far from a relic of a bygone era, remains an indispensable tool in our modern world."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to provide solace to the downtrodden and aid to the oppressed. It is a calling that speaks to the depths of my being, a calling that stirs within me a sense of duty and a desire to make amends for the suffering of others. The values that guide me in this pursuit are service, respect, and an unyielding commitment to ethical conduct. These are not merely ideals, but the very fabric of my existence, woven into the tapestry of my being.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of those in need, but the path that lay before me was shrouded in uncertainty. It was only through the trials and tribulations of others that I began to see my purpose. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, hiding behind a veil of denial, while others succumbed to coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their woes. It was in these moments of despair that I knew I had to act. I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a decision that would ultimately lead me to the threshold of a career in social work.\n\nThe summer of 2009 was a turning point for me. A chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy, ravaged by the brutal hand of abuse. His story lingered in my mind, a haunting reminder of the darkness that lurked in the shadows of our society. I was compelled to act, to do something, anything, to help. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a scene of turmoil and deception. The parents, shrouded in a web of denial, sought to deflect blame onto their son, labeling him a manipulator. In that moment, I knew that I had to take a stand. I shared my concerns with the police, and though they were bound by the constraints of the law, I vowed to continue my crusade against the cycle of abuse.\n\nThat encounter sparked a fire within me, a flame that burns bright to this day. It ignited a passion for social work, a desire to help those who have been ravaged by the brutal hand of society. I am drawn to the concept of social justice, a notion that has long been shrouded in hypocrisy. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we strive for conformity, for sameness. I refuse to be bound by these constraints. I am an individual, unapologetic and unafraid to challenge the status quo. I have walked the walk, protesting against injustice in all its forms: a bold declaration of self through my appearance, a steadfast commitment to fighting against racism and discrimination.\n\nMy journey is not one of self-discovery, but of purpose. I am driven by a sense of duty, a sense of responsibility to those who have been marginalized, to those who have been silenced. I will continue to fight against social injustice, to challenge the norms, to push against the boundaries that confine us. I will not be swayed by the whims of society, for I am a force to be reckoned with, a force for change.",
            "The desolate expanse of insomnia stretches out before us, a chasm of restless nights and wakeful days. The biological model, a sterile landscape of genes and neurons, attempts to chart the contours of this unyielding disorder. It is a realm where the hypothalamus reigns supreme, its neurons firing in a dance of sleep and wakefulness. The orexin neurons, those clandestine agents of the night, hold sway over the tides of slumber. And within them, a mystery unfolds, a tale of GABA receptors and their phenotypic manifestation in the mice.\n\nA study, a fleeting moment of insight, stirs the ashes of our understanding. The researchers, intrepid explorers of the somnambulant realm, discover that the GABAB receptor, that enigmatic sentinel of sleep, holds the key to the mysteries of the night. Its activation, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, coaxes the mice into a deep and dreamless sleep. But when its fires are extinguished, the darkness closes in, a shroud of anxiety and wakefulness. The GABAB agonist, a medicine for the afflicted, brings solace to the troubled mind, inducing sleep and quieting the storms of the night. The implications, a whispered promise of hope, speak to the genetic and environmental basis of this receptor in humans. A defect, a crack in the armor of the GABAB receptor, can unleash a maelstrom of sleeplessness, a torment that can shatter the very fabric of our lives.\n\nAnd yet, the sociocultural model, a tapestry of relationships and influences, whispers a different tale. It speaks of the intricate dance of environment and heredity, of the ways in which our surroundings and our genes conspire to shape our sleep patterns. The sociocultural factors, a complex web of factors, whisper secrets of the past, of the traumas and the triumphs that have shaped our lives. The researchers, intrepid cartographers of the human experience, chart the topography of this realm, mapping the contours of our sleep disorders.\n\nThe Dyssomnias, a collection of sleep disorders, unfold like a dark and foreboding landscape. Primary Insomnia, a thief in the night, steals our rest, leaving us shattered and worn. Primary Hypersomnia, a siren's call, beckons us to the land of the awake, where the shadows dance and the wind howls. Narcolepsy, a cruel mistress, holds us in her thrall, subjecting us to the whims of her dark and capricious nature. The Parasomnias, a band of misfits, roam the fringes of our consciousness, leaving in their wake a trail of terrors and unquiet dreams.\n\nAs we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must confront the darkness within ourselves. We must confront the ghosts of our past, the traumas and the triumphs that have shaped our lives. We must acknowledge the sociocultural forces that have molded us, the ways in which our environment and our genes have conspired to shape our sleep patterns. Only then can we begin to understand the true nature of insomnia, that insidious and unforgiving disorder that has taken hold of our lives.\n\nThe research, a fragile thread of insight, speaks to the genetic and environmental basis of this disorder. The study on mice, a fleeting moment of understanding, suggests that the GABAB receptor holds the key to our sleep patterns. The sociocultural model, a complex tapestry of relationships and influences, whispers secrets of the past, of the ways in which our surroundings and our genes have shaped our lives. But the truth, a mirage on the horizon, remains elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons us deeper into the heart of the desert. And so we must press on, driven by a burning need to understand, to unravel the mysteries of insomnia and to find solace in the darkness.",
            "The gray vastness of the mind, where sound and silence converge in a maelstrom of dissonance. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a labyrinth of the unquiet brain, where the echoes of the external world refuse to cohere into meaning. It is a realm of disquieting confusion, where the normally attuned ear finds itself lost and adrift in a sea of conflicting sounds.\n\nIn the earliest whispers of this disorder, the ghosts of \"auditory imperception\" haunted the shadows of the 1950s. Researchers, like specters in a dimly lit chamber, sought to grasp the elusive essence of this affliction. The Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari conjured forth tests in 1954, while Kimura, a sorceress of the mind, wove her spell of dichotic testing in 1961. The threads of their collective research began to weave a tapestry of understanding, though the outlines of this disorder remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs the years unfolded, the manifestations of CAPD began to reveal themselves, like the incremental layering of ash upon the charred remains of a once-green forest. The sufferer's ears, though not impaired by the external world, find themselves crippled by the silences that lie between the sounds. The spatial coordinates of sound are lost, as if the very fabric of reality had been torn asunder. The permutations of sound become a chaos of conflicting frequencies, a cacophony that defies the ear's futile attempts to impose order. The sounds of speech, like a whispered promise, are reduced to a jumble of indistinguishable whispers.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a puzzle, a riddle that requires the cunning of a puzzle-maker to unravel. Observers must scrutinize the listening behaviors of the afflicted, as if searching for the telltale signs of a wounded beast. Questionnaires and surveys, like the gentle probing of a physician, seek to grasp the depth of the disorder. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with the instruments of their trade, attempt to pierce the veil of confusion. Yet, the elusive nature of CAPD defies precise categorization, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and vanishes, leaving the seeker lost in the labyrinth of the mind.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, the teacher in a mainstreamed classroom finds themselves navigating a treacherous landscape. Like a guide through a blasted heath, they must thread the needle of accommodation, lest the fragile threads of the student's understanding be snapped by the harsh winds of misunderstanding. It is a delicate dance, a pas de deux between the teacher's words and the student's ear, where the slightest misstep may plunge the entire edifice into chaos.\n\nAnd so, the teacher must be aware of the red flags that signal the presence of CAPD: the mishearing of words, the failure to distinguish between competing sounds, the struggle to follow the thread of a conversation. Like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind, they must be attuned to the subtle cues of the disorder, lest the student become lost in the labyrinth of their own confusion.\n\nIn this way, the teacher becomes a guardian of the threshold, a sentinel who stands watch over the fragile boundary between sound and silence. It is a role that requires patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human heart, for it is in the depths of the mind that the true meaning of CAPD lies, a mystery that only the most sensitive of souls may dare to approach.",
            "In the morass of deception, where masks are worn to conceal the truth, Twelfth Night poses a question that hangs like a specter over the landscape: what cost does one pay for preserving the self, and what is the price of preserving relationships with others? The play suggests that donning a disguise, whether to deceive or protect, is a perilous game, one that risks losing oneself in the labyrinth of deception. The problem lies not only in the deception itself, but in the alienation that follows, a chasm that can never be fully bridged.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is a particularly treacherous terrain, fraught with unseen dangers and unspoken motivations. Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate attempt to preserve her own identity, to shield herself from the perils of a foreign land. Yet, this ruse not only isolates her from the women around her, but also sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her life. She becomes trapped in a web of confusion, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and Orsino's suppressed desires are unleashed, threatening to consume her.\n\nThis is not merely a cautionary tale of the dangers of deception, but a nuanced exploration of the human psyche, where the lines between truth and falsehood are blurred. The play suggests that deception can be a double-edged sword, one that can both conceal and reveal, shield and expose. In the case of Olivia, her attraction to Cesario is a complex tapestry of desire and deception, a dance between the appearance of a man and the reality of her own desires. Does she love Cesario for who he appears to be, or is it a deeper yearning that lies beneath the surface? The answer lies in the ambiguity of Olivia's character, a woman who judges others by their appearance, yet is herself a master of disguise.\n\nThe play's exploration of deception raises more questions than it answers, leaving the reader to ponder the consequences of our actions, and the cost of preserving our true selves in a world that often values appearance over reality. In the end, it is a testament to Shakespeare's genius that Twelfth Night remains a timeless and haunting work, a reflection of our own complexities, and the secrets we keep, and the masks we wear.",
            "The darkness of colonial rule has been a stain upon the conscience of nations, its brutality most starkly exemplified in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of German South West Africa. Yet, this singular event cannot encapsulate the totality of the German colonial empire's multifaceted nature. Policies and ruling styles varied as the lands themselves, a tapestry woven from diverse threads. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly kaleidoscopic, a reflection of the empire's capricious grasp.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika), they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the German efforts in that land. Contemporary authors lauded the educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies, a glowing testament to the empire's more benevolent aspects. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark and haunting contrast emerged. Unlike the East African model, where the government actively constructed state schools and nurtured the intellectual development of the native population, the task of education in South West Africa was abandoned to the charitable endeavors of missionary societies, their efforts woefully underfunded by the government.\n\nThe colonial authorities, however, did invest substantial resources in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a robust system of state schools and heavily regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching consequences, echoing through the annals of history long after German rule had ceased. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the empire's capricious nature.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, their tangled web a maze of cause and effect. This paper seeks to unravel these threads, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans, a subject hitherto veiled in obscurity. The literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and complex, with most sources penned in German and published during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works sought to chronicle the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies, laying the groundwork for future studies.\n\nLater writings in English expanded the discourse, conducting comparative analyses of education in the German colonies and delving into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, a testament to the empire's patchwork nature. Cohen's seminal work, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a beacon of insight into the factors that contributed to the divergence between these two colonies. According to Cohen, the sizable settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would come to define the relationship between colonizer and colonized.\n\nSouth West Africa boasted a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert expanses stretched across much of the territory. The European population, reflecting the colonizers' preference for fertile lands, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark contrast to the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population. This demographic disparity would come to shape the very fabric of the educational system, a system that would have far-reaching consequences for the native population, leaving an indelible mark on the collective memory of the region.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the classification of popular music has grown like a cancer, a festering sore that spreads its tendrils across the landscape. A century of proliferation has yielded a labyrinth of genres, each one a twisting, turning path that disappears into the darkness. And within these genres, sub-genres sprout like mushrooms after a spring rain, their delicate caps unfolding to reveal the rot within. Heavy Metal, that most primal and unforgiving of styles, has become the epicenter of this morass, a maelstrom of sound that churns with the fury of a tempest.\n\nIt is a movement born of darkness, a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. Metal is the music of the shadows, a cacophony of bass and volume that shatters the complacency of the mundane. It is a music of the wild and the savage, a primal scream that echoes through the void. And at its core, a sickness festers, a disease that spreads its tendrils through the very fabric of the music. It is a movement defined by its addiction to the darker aspects of the human experience, a morbid fascination with the abyss that yawns open like a chasm.\n\nIn the 1970s, a generation of musicians emerged, their minds afire with the madness of psychedelia. They crafted records that were at once otherworldly and visceral, their music a reflection of the chaos that raged within. And from these records, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence like a stain across the musical landscape. The Beatles, those vaunted icons of popular music, contributed to this movement with their own brand of darkness, their song \"Helter Skelter\" a twisted, nightmarish vision of the abyss that lay waiting.\n\nThe song was a response, a challenge to the Rolling Stones, those titans of rock, who had dared to tread the darker side of the emotional spectrum. And in doing so, the Beatles unleashed a maelstrom of sound that would forever change the face of music. Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence far and wide, a cancer that would consume the very fabric of popular music.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a reflection of our own darkness, a manifestation of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music of the shadows, a music of the wild and the savage. And it is a music that will not be silenced, a cacophony that will continue to echo through the void, a reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of us all.",
            "In the crucible of his own tortured imagination, Henri Rousseau forged his dreams, both literal and figurative, a few decades before the Surrealists would later conjure their own dreamlike visions. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle, a perpetual quandary that haunted him throughout his career. On one hand, he yearned for the approbation of his peers and the art world he so fervently admired; on the other, he was drawn to the siren song of creative independence, the freedom to chart his own course, untethered by the conventions of his time.\n\nTo grasp the full import of The Dream, one must first immerse oneself in the labyrinthine narrative of Rousseau's life. Born on a fateful day in May 1844, in the provincial town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who basked in the comforts of bourgeois prosperity. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, Rousseau's path to artistic expression was fraught with uncertainty. Unencumbered by formal training, he toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. It was only then, in the aftermath of his wife Clémence's untimely passing, and the devastating loss of eight infant children, that Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge from his grief.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's oeuvre was inextricably linked to the hopes and aspirations of the common man. Unlike his contemporaries, who often sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's art was a testament to his own humble origins. His struggles to gain recognition in the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an advanced age, amidst a landscape dominated by the likes of Matisse and other modern masters. It was only when the latter's star began to rise that Rousseau's own artistic reputation began to gain traction.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, astutely observed that while both artists were technically adept, their motivations were as divergent as their styles. While Matisse shuddered at the prospect of painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau's desire was to craft works so conventionally alluring that they would secure his place among the Artiste Français. The Dream, with its portrayal of a woman awestruck by the wonders of a dream world, serves as a poignant manifestation of Rousseau's eternal conundrum: to conform to the standards of the art world or risk embracing the unconventional, the uncharted path of creative expression.",
            "In the unforgiving light of reason, philosophers have long posited a bond between the realm of ethics and that of aesthetics, between truth and beauty. It is a notion that resonates deeply, a hunch that there exists a hidden affinity between the two. As John Keats once penned in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We know that much of our understanding of the world is acquired through the rigors of education and experience. Yet, it seems that our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics arises not through instruction, but a more primal, instinctual grasp. Both endeavors are attempts to describe, not prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to distill the essence of why a piece of art or literature stirs the soul, or why an action is deemed just, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating. \n\nCriticism of art or morals is akin to trying to grasp a fistful of sand - the harder we squeeze, the more it slips through our fingers. A discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these mere words do not capture the depths of its beauty. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I propose that both art and morals can never be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we dissect the properties of a work of literature, there remains an intangible, transcendent quality that eludes our grasp. I suggest that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this enigmatic, unnamable essence that I believe is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that provides a connection point between them.\n\nI propose that morality and art are inextricably linked because we experience both most profoundly at a level that defies rational explanation. They impact us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This bond is even more pronounced when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany stretches across the vast expanse, a tattered tapestry woven from the disparate threads of a multitude of cultures. From the dark, granite spires of the Alps to the gray, unforgiving shores of the Baltic Sea, the very essence of Germany seems to seep from the earth itself. The Rhine River, a lifeblood, courses through the heart of the land, its waters whispering secrets to the ancient stones of Köln, while the Elbe River, a mournful sigh, flows through the Saxon city of Dresden. It is a land forged from the crucible of countless tribes and influences, a nation born of blood and fire.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, lies shrouded in mystery. The etymology of its name is a labyrinth of conflicting tales and ancient lore. Some say it hails from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others claim it was coined by the Gauls, a neighboring people they encountered across the Rhine. Julius Caesar, that great chronicler of conquest, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the subjugated Gauls and the free peoples beyond the river. The name, a whispered secret, was born from the very lips of the Gauls themselves.\n\nIn the scorching heat of summer, Caesar penned the words, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Yet others propose that the name Germania derives from the spear, a tool of war, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" a shout that echoes across the land. The Romans, those masters of the known world, saw fit to dub the Germans as aboriginal, a people pure and untainted by the tides of immigration.\n\nIn the dusty pages of Tacitus' \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale unfolds of a land untouched by the ravages of time. \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" Tacitus wrote, his words casting a veil of mystery over the land. \"For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, those mighty conquerors, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of awe and trepidation, their gaze lingering upon the rugged landscape, the unforgiving climate, and the unyielding spirit of its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged, they dwelled upon the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a whispered rumor, a hint of a world beyond the reach of the imperial gaze. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their loyalty a double-edged sword, forged in the fire of conquest and tempered by the iron will of their people. In this land of contrasts, where the Alps meet the sea, and the Rhine flows through the heart of Europe, Germany stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of a people forged in the crucible of time.",
            "Downwards I stared, my mind a vacant slate, a dull comprehension spreading through me like a slow-moving stain.  The view before me was a void, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with meaning.  I gazed upon it with a detached awareness, my thoughts drifting in and out like autumn leaves on a lazy stream.  My mind was a mill, its cogs turning in a smooth, relentless motion, each thought coalescing and then dissolving like the ebbing tide.  \n\nIn the past, I had sought to capture the world's beauty through the eyes of others.  A book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", had promised to teach me the secrets of art, to unlock the mysteries of perception and translate them into line and shape.  I had envisioned myself as a master, a weaver of worlds, a teller of tales.  But now, standing before the bowl, I was lost, adrift in a sea of detail, unable to impose order upon the chaos.\n\nI thought of the masters - Picasso, his blue phase a distant memory; Monet, his greens a verdant haven; the Renaissance artists, their colors a riotous explosion of light and life.  And I, a humble student, standing before my own canvas, my brush poised, ready to create.  But the picture before me was a mess, a jumbled tangle of lines and shapes, a maelstrom of color and form.  I felt the weight of my dreams, the crushing burden of my aspirations, bearing down upon me like a physical force.\n\nMy hand lifted, hesitant, unsure, and with a jerky, spasmodic motion, I struck the handle of the toilet.  The offending package remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence, a constant reminder of the futility of my efforts.  I stood, frozen, my mind a jumble of conflicting emotions, my hand gripping the mop with a sense of desperation, my tie constricting, a physical manifestation of the noose that was tightening around my neck.\n\nI stared at the package, a loathsome, repulsive thing, a reminder of the squalid reality that lay beneath the surface of my dreams.  And yet, I was drawn to it, fascinated by its ugly, mocking presence.  I felt a sense of kinship with it, a sense of shared humanity.  It was a thing, a object, a piece of the world, just as I was.  And in its refusal to yield, its stubborn, unyielding presence, I saw a reflection of my own futility, my own failure.\n\nI stood there, lost, confused, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, my hand hovering over the water, ready to dip into the abyss, to confront the reality that lay beneath the surface.  It was a moment of truth, a moment of reckoning, a moment that would change me forever.  And when I finally reached out, my hand dipping slowly into the water, it was not to create, but to confront, to face the ugliness, the mess, the squalor that lay before me.  It was a moment of surrender, a moment of acceptance, a moment that would set me free.",
            "In the somber stillness of a nation's reckoning, a dire statistic unfolds like a shroud over the youngest of drivers. Behind the wheel, they succumb to an unforgiving fate, their inexperience a woeful litany of error and misstep. The National Institutes of Health whisper a grim truth: the adolescent brain, still formative and unsteady, is ill-equipped to navigate the perils of the road. The pedestrian inexperience that accompanies this condition multiplies the risk of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and the cruel fate of driving off into the void.\n\nIn the silences between laughter and camaraderie, a harsh reality takes hold: the presence of peers in the passenger seat multiplies the danger. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has documented this correlation, a stark testament to the perils of youthful inexperience. The response, a provisional driver's license, a temporary salve that restricts hours and prohibits minors as passengers, is a hollow gesture, a stalling measure against the crushing weight of statistical evidence.\n\nThe real issue, a truth that refuses to be gainsaid, is that the youngest drivers, as a demographic, are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research has illuminated the inherent risk-taking tendencies of those under the age of 19 or 20, a proclivity for the thrill that cannot be ignored. It is a counsel of prudence, then, to delay the granting of a regular driver's license until the propensity for risk-taking has begun to ebb. To continue to issue licenses to young teens is to court disaster, to invite a death toll that will likely reach staggering proportions in the next few years. The Baby-Boomer's children, a demographic tidal wave, will soon be eligible to take the wheel, and the nation will be inundated with a new generation of inexperienced drivers.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be a straightforward matter of national will. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted prior to the issuance of a full license, with a certain number of practical training hours remaining a requirement. The specific number of hours, based on the standards already in place in most states, could serve as a benchmark. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teens across the nation, a bulwark against the rising tide of fatalities.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but a necessary measure to stem the tide of tragedy. It is a call to action, a summons to confront the stark reality of our nation's deadliest statistic. The time for action is now, before the next generation of drivers takes to the road, before the death toll reaches its apocalyptic peak. We must act, or risk being forever burdened by the knowledge of what might have been, of what we could have done to prevent the avoidable tragedy that unfolds before us.",
            "In the dusty recesses of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors. Fifteen trick films, born between 1895 and 1901, lay before me, their enchanting illusions a product of the era's creative editing prowess. My study of these films delved into the poetic underpinnings that governed the majority, while I scrutinized the evolutionary aberrations present in a select few of the later films. The trick films of the time, I discovered, adhered to a set of strict guidelines. They were bound by the confines of a frontal proscenium, shot in a static frame, bereft of camera movement, and adhering to the dogmatic rule of one shot equals one film. However, as the century turned, a few audacious films began to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations like multiple shots.\n\nA peculiarity common to these trick films was the choice of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained steadfast, unmoving, as figures and objects were confined to the static space. This compositional device drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic acts. A limitation inherent in this design was that figures could only move side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, like performers on a stage. Even as they exited the frame, the camera remained stationary, a frozen witness to their departure.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition governed the shot lengths, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity, a departure from the theatrical tradition where the audience beheld the entire performance within the proscenium's borders. In these early films, actors remained rooted to the middle ground, eschewing any movement towards the camera. As a result, close-ups were an alien concept, a narrative tool yet to be discovered.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. This constraint also circumscribed the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on brief vaudeville-style tricks – magic, disappearing acts, and switching maneuvers – bereft of any meaningful story. Yet, a closer examination revealed that the notion of a single shot was, in truth, a ruse. A solitary \"shot\" might comprise multiple joined segments, concealing the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In a land scorched by the unyielding sun, where the very earth seemed to writhe in agony, John Taylor of Caroline stood resolute, a testament to the unyielding fervor of his convictions. An agrarian by trade, his steadfast dedication to the land and its people forged an unshakeable bond between his profession and his unyielding advocacy for personal freedom and government restraint. The very notion of an agrarian system served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were founded.\n\nIn a world untainted by the weight of tradition, Taylor beheld an opportunity for the United States to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by the shackles of the past. He envisioned a government that would safeguard the inherent rights of man, those primal and sacrosanct entitlements that inhere in every individual, and which, if denied to one, would imperil the very fabric of society. These rights, he insisted, must remain beyond the reach of the government, lest the very essence of their value be diminished.\n\nTaylor's worldview was shaped by a stark dichotomy, a dualism that saw humanity as a battleground between good and evil. He posited that a government must be forged from the very metals of human nature, that its virtues and vices must be tempered by the fires of human experience. Good principles, he claimed, would protect private property, nurture agriculture, and eschew the grasping hand of capitalism, forging a society that operated in harmony with the public good. And though self-interest, that most insidious of motivations, would inevitably assert itself, it was only when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the weak that it became anathema.\n\nA good government, Taylor believed, was a bulwark against the encroaching darkness of human nature, a sentinel that stood vigilant against the insidious creep of corruption. And yet, even as it guarded against the forces of evil, it must be tempered by the wisdom of careful observation, lest the very principles it sought to uphold be corrupted by the avarice and self-interest that inhered in its administrators.\n\nTaylor's commitment to the strict construction of the Constitution was unyielding, his desire for a limited Federal government unshakeable. He saw an expansive government as a luxury that would inevitably degenerate into despotism, its costs mounting as its powers grew. And yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, for he knew that such an approach would lead to corruption, to an erosion of the very principles that had shaped the nation. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's fundamental essence as a collection of sovereign states, united in their quest for liberty.",
            "The data for the third month of the project betrayed a precipitous drop in submissions. It was a decline that brought with it a sense of desolation. The winter's chill had begun to seep into the bones of the campus, and the cycle of seasons had seemingly wrested away the fervor that drove people to record their commutes. It was as if the world itself had turned gray and still, leaving naught but the faint outline of purpose.\n\nSome might say that the fall of the semester, the culmination of work and the ushering in of winter's darkness, was to blame. Others might point to the holiday season, a time when the campus lay dormant, its halls empty and still. But neither of these explanations held sway, for the truth was that the decline had begun long before the semester's end. It was a slow erosion, a gradual wearing away of the will to participate.\n\nAnd yet, as the winter's grip tightened, a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon. The Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of energy and fervor, brought a surge of new submissions. It was a fleeting respite, a reminder that the project still had life, but it also underscored the fragility of momentum. For in the face of the project's natural decline, it seemed that even the most well-crafted incentives were insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nThe problem was not simply one of engagement, but of a deeper, more ingrained habit. The freedom to drive, the independence it afforded, and the flexibility it brought were deeply ingrained in the culture. It was a siren's call, a lure that proved difficult to resist. And so, the project found itself beset on all sides by the twin challenges of decline and the siren's song of independence.\n\nIn the end, it was a question of how to overcome these obstacles, of how to find a way to entice people to abandon their cars and take up the cause. Perhaps it was not the prizes themselves that were the problem, but the lack of imagination in their conception. The gift cards, once a novelty, had grown stale and uninteresting. But what if the prizes were to be something more? What if, for instance, a bicycle or a hybrid car were to be given away? Would that have been enough to stem the tide of decline? It was a question that haunted the project, a reminder that the line between success and failure was thin indeed.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the market, a peculiar creature emerged - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF. This wretched beast, born of human ingenuity, promised to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets, but with a flexibility that belied its roots. Like a mockingbird mimicking the siren's call, it enticed investors with the promise of diversification, sans the shackles of traditional mutual funds. The ETF's expense ratios danced in the wind, a mocking parody of the average mutual fund's bloated costs. However, like a whispered rumor, the seeds of doubt were sown - the necessity of commissions on each trade, a cruel reminder that even the most enticing promises come with a price.\n\nYet, the ETF's allure persisted, a siren's call to the savvy investor. A vast array of funds beckoned, a tapestry woven from the threads of the market's tapestry. But, like a threadbare cloak, the ETF's benefits must be scrutinized, its very fabric torn asunder to reveal the truth. In this exercise, we shall dissect the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and dissect its constituent parts. We shall follow the thread of its top 10 holdings, those that comprise 63.58% of its assets, and unravel the tapestry of their performance.\n\nTo avoid the labyrinthine complexity of the entire ETF, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that hold sway over the majority of its assets. Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets, and the calculations of their Beta and Return, should they form the sole components of a portfolio.\n\nThe chart below reveals a truth - a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio would be .12 lower than that of the ETF. However, like a mirage on the horizon, the question remains - are these differences statistically significant?\n\nTo answer this riddle, we shall turn to the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results of this exercise shall reveal whether the ETF's benefits are a chimera or a reality, whether the diversification it promises is a myth or a truth.",
            "The forgotten realms of Dream-Land, a realm of shadows and the lost, where the echoes of the past reverberate like a dirge in the void. It was here that Edgar Allan Poe chose to set his poem, a dark and haunting landscape that mirrored the depths of his own troubled soul. And within this forsaken land, the whispers of the ancients beckoned, their secrets waiting to be unearthed. \n\nThe term \"Thulé\" - a name that echoed through the chambers of Poe's mind like a mournful sigh - held within it the weight of history and the whispered secrets of the unknown. It was a word that conjured the specter of Virgil, that ancient Greek writer who spoke of an isle beyond the edge of the known world. But the true source of this enigmatic term lay hidden, shrouded in the mists of time. Poe's fascination with German authors, particularly Goethe, led him down a path of discovery, a labyrinth of words and meanings that revealed the darkness that lay at the heart of the human condition.\n\nGoethe, a master of the poetic drama, had woven a tale of Faust, a tale of a man consumed by his own desires, a man who danced with the devil and paid the ultimate price. And within this tale lay a hidden poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a poem of a king who, lost and alone, wanders the desolate shores of a world bereft of color, haunted by the memory of his lost love. It was a poem that spoke to the very essence of Poe's own soul, a poem that echoed the darkness that lay at the heart of his own being.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" was no mere coincidence. It was a deliberate choice, a nod to the masterful Goethe, a acknowledgment of the debt he owed to the great German writer. And the poem itself, a dark and haunting landscape of shadows and lost love, was a companion piece to Goethe's own \"The King of Thulé\". It was a poem of a man lost in a world without color, a world that echoed the darkness that lay within his own soul.\n\nIn his own words, Poe spoke of his respect for Tennyson, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his being. The reproductions of Goethe's work, the echoes of his words, had seeped into Poe's consciousness, shaping his own writing, his own soul. And in the forgotten realms of Dream-Land, the whispers of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" whispered secrets to Poe, secrets of the human condition, secrets of the darkness that lay at the heart of us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of California law, a query arises like a specter from the dust: could a customer, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages for slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, citing the store manager's callous disregard for her safety? The manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, yet allowed it to persist for a half-hour, too engrossed in his dinner to tend to the mess. Was this a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages?\n\nA judge, a sentinel of justice, would not likely summarily dismiss Palmer's claim. To substantiate her claim, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were committed with a wilful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his conduct, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer may argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the previous incidents of customers slipping in the months prior to her accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may be less compelling, it is still a reasonable assertion, given the five slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009, and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn that fateful October 13th, at 5 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the spill in an aisle. Martin, consumed by his dinner break, disregarded the warning, willfully ignoring the potential harm that could befall his customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference, leaving the spill to persist for an additional quarter-hour. It was at 5:30 pm that Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury, a consequence of Martin's inaction.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" The courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe question remains: did Martin's actions constitute a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages? The evidence suggests that he did, and Palmer's case may yet prevail, a testament to the enduring power of justice in the face of indifference and neglect.",
            "It has been nearly four winters since I set foot in a classroom, endeavoring to grasp the intricacies of Islam at the CBC.  The memories of heated debates still linger, like the ghosts of winter's chill.  One discussion that lingers in my mind is the notion of whether Islam is a faith of hostility or one of benevolence.  As the years have unfolded since the shadow of 9/11 fell across the world, I've watched the media's stance shift from a posture of hostility to one of indulgent tolerance.  It was inconceivable in 2001 that a leader with the name Barack Obama, whose lineage bears the mark of Islam, would ascend to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a certain allure for me.  It is a tale of contrasts, one that seems to defy the notion of its subject.  Muhammad, as I once believed, was a man who forged conquests through violence and coercion, compelling others to adopt the faith of Islam.  Yet, the biography paints a different portrait - that of a martyr, a man misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before others.  It was through this gentle approach that people, one by one, came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nA certain mirroring of the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad struck a discordant note within me.  The most striking example is the tale of the multiplied mutton and milk, which seemed to echo the style of writing that aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove anything, but rather lived in the radiance of truth and miracles.  This approach, however, serves only to diminish the life and person of Jesus Christ, to borrow from his legacy and pass it off as one's own.  It is a form of thievery, a theft of the divine.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories that appear to be crafted to provide evidence of the convert's free will, to demonstrate that people came to Islam of their own accord.  But these tales, passed down through third-party narrators, strike me as suspect.  The narrative is compromised by its reliance on hearsay, its stories diluted by the whispers of others.  This method, intended to prove the truth of the stories, only serves to undermine their authenticity.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly stature, to portray him as a humble, endearing, wise, and gentle soul.  History, however, reveals a different tale, one of power and conquest.  I am left to wonder if the adherents of Islam are aware of the true narrative of Muhammad's rise to power, the delicate balance of politics and bloodshed that led to his ascension.",
            "In the depths of time, the teachings of Jesus were forsaken, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of Christian thought that sprawled forth like a bloated beast, consuming all in its path. The farther one ventured from the origin, the more the creature strayed, a slow and inexorable drift into the darkness. The world today is witness to an insidious creep, a progressive tide that threatens to engulf the traditionalists, those who cling to the dogma of old. Their voices, a faint whisper in the void, may soon be drowned out by the growing chorus of those who seek to reclaim the truth. A yearning will arise, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the core of the faith. It will be a slow and tortuous process, one that will take decades, perhaps centuries, but the outcome is inescapable: the clock will turn back, and Christianity will be remade in the image of its namesake.\n\nA great reversal will sweep across the land, a movement that will gather momentum and power, its numbers swelling like a dark and unstoppable tide. The church, that venerable institution, will remain, a steady hand guiding the faithful through the tumultuous waters of history. But the theological tide will have shifted, and the diversity that once characterized Christendom will give way to a growing uniformity. The differences that once divided will fade, like the ebbing of a once-mighty river, until all that remains is a shared understanding, a common purpose.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The once-mighty Roman Empire, which once condemned Christians to the flames, would later become a bastion of the faith. Our nation, too, has known such a transformation, from the shackles of slavery to the leadership of the African-American people. And so it will be with Christianity, as the faithful seek to reclaim the source, to strip away the layers of doctrine and return to the essence of the faith. It will require a new way of reading the words of Jesus, a recognition that they are not literal statements, but metaphorical keys to a deeper truth.\n\nLooking back, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring from which Christianity flowed. The Hebrew scriptures, the authority of a single, all-powerful God, and the conviction of a divinely revealed truth – these were the hallmarks of the faith by the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own. But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolith, divided as they were into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. The same divisions that once rent the Jewish people asunder will soon be mirrored in the Christian world, as the faithful strive to reclaim the truth, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the heart of the faith.",
            "The Jungle reveals the insidious nature of humanity. Beneath the façade of civility, men and women are driven by an unyielding self-interest, ever intent on elevating their own station at the expense of others. This perfidious tendency is starkly illustrated in the ranks of the factory owners and managers, their avarice and disregard for the well-being of others a stark and unyielding force. The behemoths of industry they oversee stand as monoliths, their chimneys belching forth a noxious haze that billows across the landscape like a shroud, casting a dark shadow over all that lies within its reach. The stench of pollution and decay clings to the very air itself, a tangible manifestation of the callous disregard with which these masters of industry view the fragile lives of those they employ.\n\nTheir employees, toiling in the depths of the factories, are but mere cogs in a machine, their worth measured solely in terms of their utility to the enterprise. The owners and managers are unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed on the ledger, where the ledger entries dance and swirl with the endless pursuit of profit. The workers toil and struggle, their hours lengthened, their pay pittance, their future uncertain. And when they falter, they are cast aside, discarded like so much trash, their memories erased from the ledgers, their very existence forgotten.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set is a time of great darkness, a time when the rule of law was lax, and the powerful were unaccountable. The workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and desperation, were forced to conform to the whims of their masters, their every move circumscribed by the harsh realities of their existence. The unions, formed in the hope of redressing the balance, often proved little more than a charade, their leadership corrupted by the very system they sought to challenge. The workers, like slaves in a forgotten era, were bound to the whims of their masters, their lives reduced to a mere existence, devoid of hope or dignity.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, the line between right and wrong is blurred, and the strong prey upon the weak. It is a world in which the very notion of humanity is distorted, where the pursuit of self-interest is the only guiding principle. And in this desolate realm, the workers of Packingtown toil, their lives a testament to the inhumanity that lies at the heart of their world.",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to impart a particular sentiment or disposition towards pivotal subjects. These methods can be more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this with his deployment of disparate word pairings in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs adjectives with nouns in an unconventional manner to imbue a particular aura around a subject. Additionally, Fitzgerald attributes significance to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a specific meaning. He exercises this latter technique with various colors, most notably white, gray, and the dichotomy of red and pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald constructs a nuanced understanding of white and gray, and later leverages this understanding to elicit a specific emotional response from the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white connoting a superior, refined quality and gray signifying age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this association at the commencement of the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white\" (8), and their attire is not the only instance of this phenomenon - Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to attend Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). Conversely, the only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls\" are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color-coded meanings by applying them to mundane, unimportant subjects: as Nick travels to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of partygoers are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is situated in a \"long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). He also employs these colors to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald utilizes these colors to signify uniformity or unimportance in various subjects. This technique commences with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform aspect, a mere accessory that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to convey the impression of her being a uniform, inconsequential element, exemplified by the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

The earthy richness of herbs and the sweetness of berries and honey mingle with the spicy tang of peppers, a medley of flavors born of the land's fertility.\n\nBut this land, so bountiful and green, holds a secret. Beneath its surface, the weight of history presses down upon it. The Native Americans who once walked these hills, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who followed, all have left their mark. The land's memory is a palimpsest, a layering of stories and struggles, of triumphs and defeats. The original homestead patent, a document of ownership and possession, serves as a tangible reminder of the land's storied past.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to till this land, would do well to consider the weight of history. The temptation to clear the land, to tame its wild beauty, would be great. But the rewards of organic farming, though greater in the long run, would come at a cost. The labor would be intense, the management of pests and weeds a constant struggle. The soil, too, would require care, a gentle coaxing to bring forth its full potential. And yet, the benefits would be worth it: a land teeming with life, a diverse tapestry of plants and animals, a haven for those who seek refuge.\n\nThe land in question, a parcel of 160 acres adjacent to the town of Potrero, lies in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The Cleveland National Forest looms nearby, a sentinel of the wild. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its infancy, seeks to protect the delicate balance of this ecosystem. Over a hundred species of plants and animals are considered, many of them endangered, others on the precipice of extinction.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to make a living from this land, would need guidance, expertise, and resources. The government programs, designed to aid small-scale farmers, would be a lifeline, a means of supporting the delicate balance of this ecosystem. An organic farm in the area, a model of what could be achieved, would serve as a beacon, a testament to the power of gentle husbandry.\n\nThe land, a palimpsest of stories, holds within it the potential for redemption. A small farmer, willing to listen to its whispers, could coax forth a bounty of life, a celebration of the beauty and diversity of this sacred earth.",
            "It is in the dusty, worn pages of human interaction where the weight of culture is most palpable. Culture, a chameleon of nuanced understandings, defies simplicity, its essence existing in the spaces between what it is and what it represents. It does not reside in the tidy confines of a single definition, nor can it be reduced to the sweeping generalizations that often accompany it. To say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is to speak in hushed tones of a stranger, a faint echo of truth that dissipates upon closer inspection.\n\nIn the realm of negotiation, culture is a behemoth that must be approached with reverence and humility. The act of understanding a foreign culture is a slow dance, one that begins with the recognition of its own complexities and the inevitability of comparisons. It is a labyrinth of twisted corridors and half-remembered histories, where the air is thick with the whispers of prejudices and the heavy scent of tradition.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, a negotiator must eschew judgment and instead choose to accept the culture for what it is, in all its messy, beautiful glory. Within the sterile halls of negotiation, respect for the traditions and beliefs of the other is the only currency that can truly be exchanged. And it is here, in the give-and-take of give-and-take, that the true power of culture is revealed: its capacity to both unite and divide, to bind and to break.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be neatly categorized as national or international. It seeps into the marrow of companies, establishments that pulse with their own unique rhythms and cadences. A corporate culture might prize the long hours of the office or the relaxed rhythms of a bygone era. In the way employees dress, communicate, and hire, the contours of a company's culture are revealed. Some companies are bastions of philanthropy, while others are more cautious, their benevolence carefully calibrated.\n\nAnd so, too, the values that underpin a culture are a complex tapestry of why and how. If saving face or communal harmony are the bedrock of a culture, a negotiator will not risk sullying his company's reputation at the negotiating table. Conversely, a culture that prizes the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by the twin siren songs of compromise and concession. To navigate these waters, a negotiator must be attuned to the subtle vibrations of his opponent's culture, to the hidden harmonics that shape their very being.\n\nBut to truly succeed, a negotiator must do more than simply grasp the broad strokes of a culture. He must delve deeper, into the intricate web of personal histories and motivations that underpin the negotiation. It is in this pursuit of understanding that the true art of negotiation is revealed: a delicate dance of give-and-take, of give and take, of understanding and respect.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human heart, a void yawns with the words of the fool: \"There is no God.\" A phrase born of the ancient Psalm 14, an affirmation echoed by the venerable St. Anselm in his unyielding defense of the divine. Yet this conviction finds kinship in the argument of Thomas Aquinas, a union of purpose that warrants scrutiny. We shall delve into the depths of their reasoning, assuming as a guiding principle that both are correct in their assertion of God's existence, specifically the biblical God. Any deviation from this premise would distort the comparison, for their arguments are rooted in the singular notion of a supreme being.\n\nTo evaluate their theses, we must first consider Anselm's pathway to understanding. His creed posits that the proof of God resides within the recesses of the self. By introspection, one discovers the existence of God through the unshakeable certainties that reside within. This idea, though oft shrouded in the labyrinthine language of the theologian, is a notion that faith is not a necessary adjunct to reason, but rather an intrinsic aspect of human perception. Anselm's words suggest that truth lies within, a self-contained concept that supersedes empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more austere view. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical observation, obviating the need for faith. This stance holds promise for evangelism, as it affords the prospect of attracting converts through logic, unencumbered by the burden of unverifiable claims. Aquinas' quintet of logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – serves as the foundation for his assertion. Each presents a rational pathway to the conclusion that God's existence is a logical necessity. The notion that a puzzle, though incomplete, reveals its missing piece through the interconnectedness of the remaining elements is a testament to the power of reason in illuminating the divine.\n\nHowever, both Anselm and Aquinas fall short in providing a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while formidable, are insufficient to bridge the chasm between the abstract and the tangible. The existential void within the human experience remains, an abyss that their reasoning cannot fully suffuse.",
            "In the unremembered time of the ancients, a prince was born who would one day be called Buddha. His life unfolded like a dark and winding river, guiding him toward the shores of enlightenment. The teachings he would bring forth would form the bedrock of Buddhism, a river of doctrine that would flow through the ages, its waters changing with the seasons, yet remaining constant in their essence. The most traditional of these waters, Theravada, had flowed for over two and a half millennia, its banks altered by the capricious tides of time. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony of water-cutting was observed, a tradition that seemed to flow from the very bedrock of the religion, yet was born of a silence in the teachings of the Buddha. This divergence was but one example of the many changes that had taken place, from the superficial trappings of tradition to the fundamental truths of the soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, had been shaped by forces both within and without, some hostile, some benign.\n\nThe dichotomy of internal and external forces would be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force was one born of the Buddhist community itself, regardless of monastic status, while an external force was any influence from outside the fold. A hostile force was one that sought to damage or destroy the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith, while a benign force was one that neither sought to harm nor to help, though its effects may have been far-reaching nonetheless. These terms would be woven throughout the tapestry of this discourse.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, one must delve into the fundamental doctrines that underpinned the faith. Buddhists sought refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma was comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture, each one a vessel filled with the waters of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contained the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka held the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka concealed the metaphysical secrets of the faith. These metaphysical notions – Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things – held the key to unlocking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara. By recognizing these truths, one could escape the prison of lobha, dosa, and moha, the desire, hatred, and delusion that bound humanity to the wheel of suffering.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka laid out the rules for living, five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lay the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome. These truths, like the waters of a river, flowed through the ages, shaping the landscape of the faith, ever-changing, yet remaining constant in their essence.",
            "In the arid expanse of time, two nations stood as rival sentinels, their animosity forged in the crucible of discord and tempered by the fires of conflict. The United States and Mexico, bound by a shared border, yet pitted against each other in a struggle that spanned nigh on 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The conflict's zenith was the Mexican-American War, a cataclysmic conflagration that ravaged the landscape and left in its wake a scarred and divided landscape. The United States emerged victorious, its dominion over Texas and the American Southwest a testament to its unyielding resolve.\n\nYet, this was not an isolated aberration, for the roots of this rivalry ran deep, nurtured by the divergent threads of culture, tradition, and faith. The clash of material interests, a siren's call to discord, further exacerbated the schism between the two nations. As the years accumulated, the wounds of the past festering like an open sore, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico seemed an intractable problem, a Gordian knot that refused to be untangled.\n\nAnd yet, it is a phenomenon that has played out time and again, a cycle of enmity and distrust that echoes through the annals of history. Nations bound by geography, yet sundered by the fault lines of difference, their relationships strained by the competing claims of self-interest. David M. Pletcher's words, a Cassandra's warning, still resonate: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The shared border, a fragile membrane separating two worlds, proved a brittle barrier against the encroaching tides of discord.\n\nReligious animosity, a potent catalyst for conflict, had long been a specter haunting the relationship between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm's observation, a piercing insight, cuts to the heart of the matter: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm, a seemingly insurmountable divide, threatened to consume the fragile dialogue between the two nations.\n\nThe legacy of colonialism, a toxic inheritance, continued to poison the relations between the United States and Mexico. The distrust, a festering wound, was a reflexive reaction to the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. The echoes of this past, a lingering shadow, continued to shape the present, a ghostly presence that refused to be exorcised.\n\nDiehl and Goerts' catalog of 17 disputes, a grim litany, serves as a testament to the depth of the rivalry. Territorial disputes, a recurring theme, seemed an intractable problem, a roadblock to any meaningful rapprochement. Border raids, a scourge on both sides, only served to further inflame the tensions between the two nations.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the dynamics of power began to shift, and the United States' ambitions, like the tides, began to ebb and flow. Mexico, once a proud and independent nation, became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor, a circumstance that ultimately sapped the vitality of the rivalry. As American interests shifted from territorial aggrandizement to economic domination, the tempests of discord began to subside, and a fragile peace took hold.",
            "Fifteen years ago, a shadow crept in, unseen and uninvited, and claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, a stalwart guardian of the vulnerable, but I had never known its name, nor had I ever imagined its power to reduce me to nothing. My childhood had been a patchwork of uncertainty, a quilt of worn frayed edges, and the mantra that had sustained me was that of a certain solace: 'There will always be work, for people will always fall ill.' And so, I had chosen nursing, a profession that promised a semblance of security, a fortress against the tempests of life.\n\nBut now, I am 46 years old, my bank account a hollow shell, my body a fragile vessel, and my future a labyrinth of uncertainty. Social Security Disability has been my meager sustenance for fifteen years, a constant reminder that I am no longer the pillar I once was. Each day is a struggle, a battle to preserve what little remains of my dignity, my security, and my self-worth. The world outside is a harsh and unforgiving place, and I am but a small, battered leaf on a windswept tree.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this desolation, there is one truth that I hold fast: I could not have endured these long, dark years without the kindness of my loved ones and a few loyal friends. They have been my lifeline, my shelter from the storm, and I am forever in their debt. When disaster strikes, as it inevitably will, we do not stand alone; we are but threads in a tapestry of human connection, fragile and vital.\n\nWe live in a world that worships the notion of individual strength, of rugged self-reliance, but I say to you: it is a myth, a Potemkin village of self-sufficiency. Our forebears did not conquer the wilderness alone; they walked in the footsteps of those who had come before, their hands extended in offering and acceptance. They knew that in the face of the unknown, we are but fragile, vulnerable creatures, and that the only true strength lies in the bonds we weave with one another.\n\nSo, be prepared, I say. Prepare your disaster kit, your first aid supplies, your water purifying tablets. Learn to can and preserve your own food, to tend a wood stove, to navigate the dark. But do not forget the most important resource of all: the human heart. Learn to trust your neighbors, to ask for help, to offer it in return. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will see us through, but the threads of connection that bind us, frail and resilient, to one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do is one that has long plagued the minds of biologists and scholars. Like a river that winds its way through the barren landscape, the path of evolution is shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, writing in 1917, confessed that the zoologist had yet to grasp the simplicity of defining organic forms in mathematical terms. And yet, it is precisely this pursuit that has driven scientists to apply mathematical modeling to the complex processes of mollusk skeletogenesis. In our study, we seek to explore the intersection of mathematical modeling and experimental investigation in the realm of Prunum, in order to uncover the hidden mechanisms that guide the trajectory of evolutionary change.\n\nWe began by examining the skeletal morphologies of Prunum species, using X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters that govern their growth and development. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a software program called CerioShell, allowing us to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to shed light on the grand narrative of macroevolutionary events in this enigmatic clade.\n\nConsider the shell of a mollusk, a twisting, turning tube that traverses the expanse of space and time. Each revolution of the shell is a whorl, a spiral turn that wraps around an invisible axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls emerge can vary, like the ebb and flow of a tide, and a line of demarcation, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is the culmination of this spiral journey, while the spire, like a majestic tower, stretches towards the apex.\n\nIn our quest to understand the shell's morphology, we must consider its various aspects: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Each of these perspectives offers a unique insight into the shell's structure, like the shifting sands of a desert dune. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer, is the most familiar, yet it is in the other views that we find the hidden patterns and codes that govern the shell's growth.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must first gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture marks the beginning of a new revolution. A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to the nearest quarter-turn. This process is akin to tracing the path of a river, following the course of the aperture as it winds its way through time and space.\n\nThe trajectory of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented, like a map of a forgotten land. By varying parameters and modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis, we can explore the possibilities of evolutionary change, and perhaps, uncover the secrets that lie hidden in the shell's twisted, turning form.",
            "In the shadow of progress, the statistics whispered a haunting refrain.  In the land of a thousand islands, a nation's heartbeat faltered.  The numbers remained static, a grim testament to the fragility of life.  Indonesia's infant mortality rate, a metric of a society's very soul, stagnated, refusing to budge.  The country's strides in water and sanitation targets were a hollow victory, a Pyrrhic triumph in the face of unyielding child and maternal health woes.\n\nA veil of complacency shrouded the nation, as if the achievements in skilled birth attendance were a beacon of hope, a shining star in the dark expanse of need.  But the truth lay in the shadows, in the traditional workers, the midwives, who held the power to seal life or snuff it out.  The statistic of 72% hid the desperation of a mother's plea, the anguish of a life cut short by a preventable hemorrhage.  The numbers whispered of a woeful need, a call to strengthen the very fabric of the health system, rather than tinkering with programmatic interventions.\n\nThe decline in diarrheal cases treated by a health professional was a symptom of a greater malaise, a disease that ate away at the very foundations of a nation.  Postnatal care, a vital lifeline, hung in the balance, its rates a testament to the country's neglect.  The cesarian-section rates, a mere 4%, a stark reminder of the chasm between urban and rural, between the haves and have-nots.  The urban elite, ensconced in their privileged world, oblivious to the struggles of the rural poor, who toiled in the shadows, denied access to the very services that could save their lives.\n\nThe inequity of coverage, a cancer that ate away at the nation's core, left the poor to suffer, their cries drowned out by the cacophony of statistics and promises.  The 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles was a stark reminder of a system in shambles, a health care system that prioritized the privileged few over the many.  The out-of-pocket costs, a burden that crushed the poor, a weight that suffocated their dreams, their hopes.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the question echoed, a haunting refrain, a call to action: how to bridge the chasm, how to bring light to the darkness?  Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, a behemoth that trembled on the brink of collapse?  The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable results, beckoned, a siren's song.  But beware, for in their haste, they risked creating a Frankenstein's monster, a system that devoured resources, leaving other areas to wither and die.\n\nThe drawbacks of such an approach haunted the shadows, a specter of duplication, of uncoordinated services, of forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of bureaucracy.  The ghosts of previous failures whispered caution, a warning of the perils of prioritizing one sector over another, of the devastating impact on the poor, who bore the brunt of the neglect.  In this dance of failure, only one question remained, a question that haunted the halls of power: how to strengthen the health system, to bring light to the darkness, to save the lives of a nation's most precious resource, its children?",
            "In the stifling grandeur of the Victorian era, two novels stand as anomalies - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Like aberrant flowers blooming in a well-manicured garden, these works burst forth with an unbridled ferocity, shattering the stifling conventions of their peers. The aristocracy, once the sole focus of the era's literary landscape, recedes into the shadows as the characters in these novels assume center stage, their motivations and emotions a tangled skein of mystery and heartache.\n\nLike a maelstrom of chaotic thoughts, a dizzying array of ideas beset the protagonist of Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these dreamlike states, the mysteries that unfold reveal the labyrinthine depths of the protagonist's inner world, their pain and awareness of the darkness that surrounds them. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, is a gruesome reminder of the loss of control that has beset him. As he relives the event in vivid detail, the boundaries between reality and dreams blur, and the extent of his despair becomes clear. The pain that has become his constant companion now thunders through his mind like a relentless drumbeat, fueling his fear and despair. And yet, it is not his own will that has brought about his misfortune, but the cruel hand of fate, its unseen forces bearing him away like a leaf on a gust of wind.\n\nIn this darkness, a sense of defeat settles over Oliver like a shroud. His will, once a flame that flickered brightly, has been extinguished, leaving only a faint ember of hope. It is as if the malevolent forces that surround him have succeeded in breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept a fate that is not his own. And so, like a bird in a gilded cage, Oliver is trapped, unable to fly, his wings clipped by the very hands that once promised him freedom.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the day itself becomes a mocking taunt, a cruel reminder of the transience of life. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\" The eternal cycle of day and night, once a comforting rhythm, now seems a heartless, uncaring mechanism, devoid of warmth or comfort. And in this desolate landscape, the characters of both novels are forged, their fates inextricably linked to the dark, unforgiving forces that surround them.",
            "The winter of the mind, when the ice of ignorance rends the tender shoots of understanding, that was the season I first encountered the boy Adrian. A third-grader, his brow furrowed in concentration, his eyes squinting against the glare of a text that refused to yield its secrets. I was tasked with guiding him through the labyrinth of English, a Sisyphean endeavor that would prove to be a test of wills. His mother, a woman who spoke only in the whispers of her native tongue, arrived unannounced, a silent presence that punctuated the hum of our after-school program. The language barrier that separated us was a chasm, a divide that yawned wide and deep, yet it was in this very moment that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's struggles were not with the words, but with their symbols. The English alphabet, a mysterious script that defied his comprehension.\n\nAs I struggled to convey this epiphany to the boy, the truth settled upon me like a shroud. The problems that plagued Adrian were not unique, but rather a symptom of a greater malady: the language barrier that afflicted our schools, a wound that bled into the very fabric of our community. California, a tapestry woven from the threads of cultures, languages, and histories, was a microcosm of this issue. The solution, much like the solution to Adrian's struggles, lay not in a single panacea, but in a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty, offered a glimmer of promise. By embracing the languages of our students, by acknowledging the diverse threads that comprised our community, we could create a tapestry of understanding. The research was clear: children who participated in two-way bilingual education programs outperformed their peers academically. Yet, fear and misconception clouded the issue, leading us to view this approach as a luxury, a indulgence that we could ill afford.\n\nBut what if we were to invert this thinking? What if we were to view bilingual education as a necessity, a cornerstone upon which our educational edifice was built? The solution did not lie in requiring teachers to be bilingual, a prospect that seemed as unrealistic as it was unreasonable. Rather, it lay in providing support, in offering the tools and resources that would empower our educators to bridge the gap. Bilingual aides, tutors, or simply, guides – the terminology mattered little – what mattered was the understanding that language was not a barrier, but a bridge, a means to connect, to communicate, and to understand.\n\nIn the end, it was not the solution that was complex, but the problem. The key lay not in a single answer, but in a multifaceted approach, one that acknowledged the diversity of our community, and the complexity of the language barrier that threatened to divide us. By embracing this complexity, by weaving together the threads of our languages, our cultures, and our histories, we could create a tapestry of understanding, a fabric that would envelop us all, and guide us forward into a brighter future.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been instilled within us since we first took our first faltering steps. It is a notion peddled by the guardians of our youth, the preachers and the scholars, the mystics and the wise men. Some among us are schooled in the dogma of Sunday morning, while others seek solace in the ancient rituals of the Temple. Still, others seek to forge their own paths, to chart their own courses through the void. We wander, drawn by the siren song of the unknown, ever searching for a lighthouse to guide us through the desolate expanse.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two dark pools, stared out into the rain-lashed evening. The droplets pattered against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that seemed to underscore the weight of his own mortality. He had grown gaunt, his frame a mere specter of its former self, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt the coldness of his hand as I took it in mine, the desperate need to hold onto him, to keep him from slipping away. The rain drummed on, a relentless cadence that seemed to mock our feeble attempts at connection.\n\n\"I like cardinals,\" he said, his voice barely audible above the din of the rain. His eyes, those dark pools, seemed to gaze right through me, searching for something in the depths of the past. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I watched him, my heart heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nHe passed into the great unknown on a cold December morning, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, those brutal, soul-sucking treatments, had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't say. What kind of deity would do this to a man, to a father, a husband, a brother? I thought, and my anger boiled over like a stormy sea.\n\nIn the darkness of that night, I made no prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my words. The silence was deafening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life. I couldn't watch as the flame that had brought me into this world flickered out. I remembered him, not in his final moments, but in the laughter we shared, the memories we created. I knew him better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew that he would want me to remember the man he was, not the man he became.\n\nI curled up in a ball, a fragile, broken thing, and waited for the news. The phone didn't ring. No one came to my door. I was left alone, adrift in a world that seemed determined to move on without me.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, a genre emerged, inconstant and reborn, a fusion of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode, a perennial enigma, has been reviled, venerated, and decried, its essence questioned, its beauty extolled (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the relics of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition with the nascent novel's promise of psychological introspection. Walpole's magnum opus, \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized the theatrical and the natural, the old and the new, to conjure a literary entity both decrepit and reborn (Walpole 4).\n\nAs the word \"gothic\" was then used to describe disparate cultures, styles, and epochs, its connotations were those of archaism and unsophistication, an affront to the progressive ideals of modern society and literature. Yet, it was this very amalgamation of the theatrical and the novelistic that enabled the Gothic genre to endure, to become at once anachronistic and contemporary, a timeless yet temporal phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most striking tenets of the Gothic novel is the concept of Chivalry, a medieval ideal of honor, bravery, and competence. This notion, ubiquitous in The Castle of Otranto, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay of society, a nostalgic longing for a bygone era of moral rectitude. Through the invocation of chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into the Romantic movement. In Walpole's hands, this nostalgia becomes a scathing critique of the present, a lamentation of the lost virtues of a bygone era.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole, beset by political turmoil and personal doubts, penned The Castle of Otranto, a work that reflects his despairing vision of a future bereft of the chivalric virtues he saw as hallmarks of a bygone era. Through the character of Frederic, Walpole embodied the chivalric ideal, a prince, a sufferer, and a warrior, whose very existence serves as a rebuke to the moral decay of his contemporaries. Frederic's description, replete with traditional chivalric imagery, underscores the excesses of the Gothic trope, a hyperbolic representation of a bygone era's ideals.\n\nIn this dichotomy of the old and the new, the Gothic novel finds its essence, a paradoxical blend of the antique and the modern, the theatrical and the novelistic. It is in this liminal space that the Gothic genre continues to fascinate and endure, a testament to the power of art to transcend time and to evoke the sublime.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a vital artery coursed through the veins of industry, nourishing the very lifeblood of enterprise. Supply chain management, a term coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, was born of necessity, a means to navigate the labyrinthine paths of goods from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Like a river carving its path through the stone of time, this process flows from the customer's order to the production, supply, and distribution of products, a serpentine journey through the wilderness of the business world.\n\nSix key elements comprise this vital flow: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, like sentinels guarding the gates of commerce, stand watch over the intricate dance of logistics. A manager's task is to orchestrate these elements, to synchronize the cadence of production, supply, and distribution, to provide the customer with a symphony of satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this grand ballet, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice of supply chain management is built. Like the first drop of water that sets the ripples in motion, production sets the tone for the entire process. The manager must know the customer's heart's desire, to discern the rhythm of the market, to understand the customer's cadence. The market, a vast and mysterious expanse, holds the key to unlocking the secrets of customer demand.\n\nWith the market's whisperings in their ear, managers can decide what products to produce, how many, and where to produce them. The location, like a compass guiding the way, must be chosen with care, lest the plans falter and the enterprise stumble. The equipment, like a finely tuned instrument, must be maintained, its performance honed to perfection.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of supply chain management, every thread is crucial, every detail a vital strand in the intricate weave. A misstep, a miscalculation, can unravel the entire fabric, leaving the company weakened, vulnerable to the whims of the market. I recall the retail stores where I once worked, Wal-Mart and Target, their systems a finely tuned machine, a symphony of processes that hummed with efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second element in this grand symphony, is the strategic decision-making process that determines the very fabric of a company's capabilities. Like a master weaver, the manager must choose the threads of production, deciding which divisions to utilize, which equipment to employ, and which partnerships to forge. The goal, like a beacon guiding the way, is to create velocity, to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs, to outmaneuver the competition.\n\nThus, the supply chain, this vital artery of commerce, pulsates with life, a testament to the ingenuity of human endeavor. In its intricate dance, we find the very essence of business, a delicate balance of production, supply, and distribution, a symphony of logistics that sustains the very fabric of our economy.",
            "On a cracked and faded sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" seemed to writhe like a discarded serpent. The sign's bearer, a girl with a haunted gaze, stood alone on a street corner, a makeshift cardboard placard held above her head like a supplicant's prayer. Beneath her, the city's streets seemed to yawn open like a dry, cracked mouth. Burma, a land shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, its people bound by the chains of oppression.\n\nThe junta's grip had been unyielding since 1962, their coup d'état a stark reminder of the darkness that lay at the heart of power. But in 2007, a spark of defiance had flared, as monks in saffron robes took to the streets, their peaceful protests a beacon of hope in a desolate land. The people, once cowed, began to stir, their voices raised in a cacophony of dissent. The government, sensing the storm, had responded with violence, its soldiers invading monasteries, ransacking temples, and silencing the voices of the brave.\n\nForeign journalists, like a token sacrifice to the gods, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their cameras and notebooks seized. One, a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, had been cut down on September 27th, 2007, a victim of the junta's ruthless hand. The official death toll, a paltry 13, was a cruel joke, a mockery of the truth. Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, had spoken the truth, his words a whispered secret in the darkness: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis was not new. The lust for power, the thirst for control, had been a poison coursing through the veins of humanity since the dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors had declared themselves gods, their rule absolute, their power unchallenged. The Japanese emperors were said to be deities, sent to guide their people through the ages, their wisdom and benevolence a myth. And in the present, a president, a man named George W. Bush, had communed with the gods, his weekly conference calls with a man named Ted Haggard a testament to the madness that lay at the heart of power.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich – these were but a few examples of the atrocities that had been perpetrated in the name of power. The death tolls, the numbers, the names, were but a faint whisper in the wind, a reminder of the horrors that lay beyond the veil of civilization. And yet, even as the darkness receded, the shadows seemed to grow longer, the silence deeper, a reminder that the cycle of violence, the cycle of oppression, was eternal.",
            "In the desolate landscape of jazz, a lone figure emerged, a conductor, a composer, a maestro. Duke Ellington's legacy was forged in the crucible of time, his years a testament to his unyielding spirit and creative faculties. His presence on the piano was as elusive as a ghostly whisper, yet his compositions thundered with a rich and complex tapestry that celebrated the unique threads of individual musicians. Like a master weaver, Ellington crafted the framework that allowed his soloists to unfurl their talents, their improvisations dancing like flames in the darkness. With each piece, he coaxed forth a coherent and original voice, a symphony of sounds that conjured worlds both familiar and unknown.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's innovative genius, couched in the example of Creole Love Call, where voice was transformed into a jazz instrument, a sonic tapestry woven with threads of texture and color. This early masterpiece showcased Ellington's predilection for voice, a trait that would become a staple of his oeuvre, freeing lyrics to unfurl like a lotus flower in the depths of his music. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues, unfolded like a slow and deliberate ritual, its six choruses a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response dialogue between voice and reeds, where the voice began as a gentle melody, only to twist and writhe like a serpent towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborated on the melody, its notes elongated and sorrowful, like the echoes of a forgotten cry.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo that soared in the high registers, its phrases entwined with a syncopated piano phrase, a dance of light and shadow.\nChorus 4: The full band responded with a call and response, the brass and reed sections weaving a tapestry of sound that enveloped the listener.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, where the reeds took on the call, their voices piercing the air like a cry of despair, accompanied by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the simplicity of the first chorus, where voice and reeds engaged in a call and response, the voice now assuming the growl technique, its solo a raw and cathartic expression.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument was a hallmark of his style, a trait that imbued his work with a dimension of tone color that was both rich and evocative. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, crafting a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. The result was a sound that was both complementary and innovative, a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further underscored these ideas, as Ellington entrusted Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton with the introduction of the melody on muted trombone, its haunting beauty a reflection of Ellington's genius.",
            "She had always felt a yawning chasm within her, a craving that refused to be satiated. It was a hunger that gnawed at her since the age of fourteen, when the world had first begun to unfurl its mysteries. Three years had passed, and yet the ache remained, a constant companion to her teenage years. It was not for things that she yearned, but for something more intangible, more human. Yet, she had felt no spark of attraction to any boy, no flutter in her chest, no whispered promise of connection. Some had tried to woo her, to reach her, but she was an enigma, a cipher that refused to be deciphered. She often questioned herself, bewildered by this peculiarity, as if it were a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nDays at home were typically a sanctuary, a refuge from the world's din. Her parents were a tranquil couple, their marriage a flame that burned bright and steady. They rarely argued, their disagreements few and far between. But with her, they were more likely to disagree, their calm demeanor clashing with her fiery spirit. She was a whirlwind, a tempest that swirled and eddied, leaving in her wake a trail of laughter and warmth. Yet, today was different. Today, the air was thick with tension, heavy with foreboding.\n\nAs she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, a cry that sent her heart racing. Her mother's voice, usually a soothing balm, was now a scream of pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mother lay on the floor, writhing in agony, her voice a staccato beat of \"Ow\" and \"ouch.\" Her daughter knelt beside her, her hand on her mother's shoulder, her heart aching with fear. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice trembling. Her mother's words were a jumbled mess, \"Swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter's mind went blank, her thoughts consumed by the need to help, to protect.\n\nShe lifted her mother, her strength and determination propelling her, and carried her to the car. She settled her mother in the backseat, and with a sense of purpose, she drove to the hospital. The antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the stench of sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that threatened to overwhelm her. But she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She rushed her to the emergency room, her voice raised in a desperate cry for help. Faces appeared, worried and concerned, and her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter to sit, to wait, to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a careless mistake that had left her writhing in pain. The thought echoed in her mind, a refrain of regret and fear. She had always been her mother's rock, her confidante, her protector. Now, it was she who needed to be strong, to be brave, to be the rock that held her mother's hand through this dark and uncertain night.",
            "In this barren landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke, a glimmer of hope emerges. A study of 74,886 women, spanning two decades, reveals that adherence to the Mediterranean diet - a scorched earth of saturated fats and animal products, bereft of the withered husks of potatoes, yet rich in the fertile soil of plant foods, monounsaturated fat, and fish - holds the key to a diminished risk of these twin scourges. This aMed diet, a variant of the Mediterranean diet, is a desolate landscape of consumption, where the once-plentiful animal products and saturated fats have been reduced to a mere whisper, a faint echo of a bygone era.\n\nThe past studies, like withered leaves on a forgotten tree, have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a beacon in the darkness, has demonstrated the Med diet's efficacy in besting a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the studies have been mute on the topic of stroke and stroke mortality, leaving a void that this study seeks to fill.\n\nThe Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in eleven US states, provided the canvas upon which this study was painted. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a fragile thread that weaves together the tapestry of nutrient intake. The study's participants, a stalwart band of women, endured for twenty years, with over 95% continuing their participation throughout the journey.\n\nAs the years passed, the once-clear waters of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke became muddied by the silt of time, but the authors persisted, using validation studies to assess the accuracy of the FFQs. The reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases without records relegated to the realm of the probable, a shadowy realm that encompassed about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe study's architects, like skilled craftsmen, adjusted for confounders - those factors that could confuse the results - by accounting for age, smoking status, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. The cumulative averages of the aMed score, a careful balancing of the scales, were calculated, and the study's results, like the first light of dawn, began to take shape.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical instrument of precision, was employed to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. And the results, like a cold, clear stream, flowed forth: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.\n\nIn the end, the study's findings, like a beacon in the darkness, shone forth, illuminating the path to a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. Women in the top aMed quintile, like a band of pilgrims on a sacred journey, were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of a nation, the echoes of a calamity still linger. A financial storm, like a black and foreboding cloud, had descended upon the United States in the year 2007. Its ruinous effects persisted, a testament to the frailty of the systems that once sustained it. The question remains: how did this catastrophe unfold, and what can be done to prevent its recurrence? In essence, the financial devastation was born of a toxic combination of self-interest and shortsighted political decision-making, which goaded banks and financial institutions into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into insuring and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was transferred onto the repackaged mortgages that had been sold to the unsuspecting public.\n\nThe roots of the financial disaster stretched back to 1999, a year of reckoning for the Clinton administration. In its pursuit of a second term, the President had let his ambition cloud his judgment, and the administration relaxed lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of future calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times had foreseen the coming storm, warning of the dire consequences of these actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, spoken seven years before the devastation, served as a Cassandra's lament, warning of the impending doom that would befall the economy.\n\nThe complexities of the mortgage market had become a labyrinth of deceit, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in their web. This created a monolith of debt, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. When the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were dire: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with their mortgage debt of $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and shortsighted decision-making.",
            "Exposition, that siren song of the writer's craft, beckons with promises of ease and convenience, a shortcut to convey the essential details of our story. Yet, it is a temptation we must resist, lest we succumb to the pitfall of tediousness and our readers abandon us for greener pastures.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-worn, yet still we stumble into the quicksand of exposition, where the narrative bogged down in oceans of backstory, the reader's attention lapses, and the magic of the story is lost. Dr. Merlin, that stalwart guardian of good writing, has been known to let out a frustrated cry when confronted with too much information, a clarion call to beware the dangers of exposition.\n\nExposition is the insidious whisper in our ear, urging us to dispense with the tedious details, to simply tell our readers what they need to know, without the bother of crafting a compelling narrative. But it is here that we must resist, for it is in the showing, not the telling, that our stories truly come alive.\n\nA case in point: let us consider the tale of a heroine and her beloved husband. We are told that they met, were married in a grand ceremony, and that he met a tragic end. But where is the depth, the richness, the emotional resonance of this telling? Do we truly believe that this pivotal moment in the heroine's life could be reduced to a few cursory lines of dialogue and exposition? No, we crave more, for it is in the nuance, the subtlety, the quiet moments of character interaction that we come to know and love these people.\n\nAs writers, we must provide that meat on the bone of the storyline, that satisfying depth that makes our readers care about the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their heartbreaks. We must resist the urge to rush past the details, to gloss over the complexities of our characters' lives, and instead, immerse ourselves in the world we are creating, the people we are bringing to life.\n\nFor it is in the telling, not the telling of, that we truly make our stories shine.",
            "I watched the flickering images emanating from the small screen, a static-filled window to a world beyond our desolate landscape. August 13th, a date lost to the annals of time, yet etched in my mind like the scars on a winters' fencepost. The news from Columbus, Ohio, a city of distant memories, where the skies were said to hold more promise than our own. \n\nA story of blood and steel, of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a visage of malevolence, a demon born of darkness and fire. A tale of a life lived in the shadows, where the line between love and hate was blurred like the horizon on a summer's day. The broadcast held it brief, a mere two minutes to paint a picture of a soul consumed by the very evil he had unleashed.\n\nNext, a story of youth and violence, of a life cut short by a bullet's cruel kiss. Travis Buyers, a name that would be lost to time, a life reduced to a statistic, a number among the countless others etched on the cold ledger of the living. The city's eyes, represented by the SWAT team, searched for answers in the Sharon Woods, a place where the very fabric of society seemed to unravel like the threads of a frayed rope. The cameras panned, a fleeting glance at a life, a life that would soon be nothing more than a distant memory.\n\nThe news, a curated selection of truths, picked and chosen to stir the pot, to fan the flames of discord. A gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss, a crime to be solved, a mystery to be unraveled. The city's ears, represented by Crime-Stoppers, offered a bounty, a price on the head of the unknown culprit, a siren's call to the brave and the foolhardy.\n\nAnd then, the weather, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reprieve from the dry, cracked earth that stretched out before us like a barren lakebed. The temperatures, a gentle reminder of a time when the world was still, a world that had not yet given way to the cold, unforgiving winds of time.\n\nBut the news, a double-edged sword, cut both ways. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a convenience store, a place where life's necessities were bought and sold. A dark-skinned man, a suspect, a creature of the night, a being of shadow and smoke. The city's voice, a disembodied whisper, spoke of him, a creature to be feared, a monster to be hunted.\n\nAnd then, a story of a man, a kingpin, a master of the underworld, a Rene Rodriguez, a name that would soon be lost to the annals of time. A man of conviction, a man of the law, a man who had sowed the seeds of his own downfall. Twenty-five years, a sentence, a number, a mere abstraction, a meaningless word in a world devoid of meaning.\n\nThe screen flickered, a static-filled window to a world beyond our own, a world of make-believe, a world of half-truths and lies. I watched, entranced, a moth drawn to the flame, a flame that would soon consume us all.",
            "The bond between brothers - a chain of unbreakable and unyielding ties that binds them together. A knot of intertwined emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all inseparable as the shadows on a winter's day. Brothers see themselves in each other, a reflection of their own souls, a mirror of their deepest selves. It is in the darkest of times, when the world around them crumbles, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this connection is steep, a heavy toll on the heart and the mind. To gaze upon a brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss of one's own character. The actions we take, the choices we make, are the only true measures of our worth.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of William Faulkner's works, two brothers embark on a futile journey, a journey that will leave one brother scarred, forever changed. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of emotions, a maelstrom that will ultimately decide their fate. The theme is as old as the earth itself, a primal force that drives us all. The author's pen weaves a tale of two brothers, of a bond that is both sacred and profane, of a love that is both all-consuming and destructive.\n\nThe protagonist's heart beats to the rhythm of one emotion alone: pride. From the earliest moments of their journey, he feels a seething resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a partner, a companion to share in the joys of life, a brother to be his equal. But fate had dealt him a cruel hand, a brother born with a fragile heart, a brother who would never be able to keep pace with his every step, his every stride. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, his fantasies reduced to dust and ashes. He had wanted a brother to join him in the wild adventures of childhood, to explore the secrets of the swamp, to run and laugh and play. But Doodle's fragile form, his delicate heartbeat, threatened to dash those dreams to pieces.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such disappointment, the protagonist's heart falters, his resolve weakening. He recalls the moment when he contemplated ending his brother's life, a heinous act of infanticide that would have shattered the very fabric of their bond. But that fleeting moment of madness was extinguished by a simple smile, a smile that spoke of hope, of love, of a bond that could not be broken. It was a mercy, a mercy that stayed his hand, a mercy that allowed him to see his brother as more than just a fragile, faltering creature.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of one brother that defines their bond, but the choices they make, the actions they take. It is in the darkest of moments, when all seems lost, that the true nature of their connection is revealed. The cost of this bond is steep, a price that must be paid in full. But it is a price worth paying, for in the end, it is the only thing that truly matters.",
            "The brain, that most inscrutable and labyrinthine of organs, a repository of thoughts and images both fleeting and indelible. Like the desolate landscapes that stretch before us, its workings are shrouded in mystery, a tapestry of neural connections and synapses that defy easy comprehension. The analogies we employ to describe its functions - a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, a computer - are as ephemeral as the whispers of the wind, offering fleeting glimpses into the abyss of its depths.\n\nAs the light of perception breaks upon its surface, the brain transforms the raw data of the world into a maelstrom of electrochemical signals. The senses, those tactile messengers that bridge the chasm between the physical and the internal, convey the whispers of the external world to the brain's dark sanctum. There, the algorithmic machinery of the mind begins to weave its spell, a tapestry of bottom-up and top-down processing that seeks to make sense of the chaotic flux.\n\nConsider the image of a black box on a white background. As the visual information enters the brain, it is initially parsed by the bottom-up process, a crude yet vital endeavor to discern the basic elements of form and color. The brain assembles the constituent parts, a patchwork of pixels and hues, to fashion a coherent whole. And yet, it is the top-down process that elevates the exercise to an art form, as the brain's accumulated knowledge and experience conspire to imbue the box with meaning and context.\n\nBut the brain's attention, a capricious and mercurial force, intervenes to filter and prioritize the flow of information. Like a sentinel standing guard at the gates of perception, it decides what receives the light of consciousness and what slumbers in the shadows. We are not aware of every blade of grass that sways in the breeze, yet our attention is drawn to the whispered name that cuts through the din of the world.\n\nAnd so the brain stores the information it has processed, a vast repository of memories and knowledge. The various forms of memory - sensory, working, and long-term - each possess their own peculiar characteristics, like separate rooms in a labyrinthine mansion. Information is encoded, a process as delicate as the dance of particles in the quantum realm. Sensory input is transmuted into its various forms, a sequence of phonemes, a visual pattern, or a semantic meaning.\n\nBut the very act of storage is a fragile one, subject to the whims of entropy and the ravages of time. Working memory, that fleeting repository of immediate information, is sustained by the ephemeral spark of electrical signals, a brief and shining moment in the annals of consciousness. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is hypothesized to be anchored in the very fabric of the brain itself, a testament to the indomitable will of the mind to endure.\n\nThe models of knowledge organization that have been proposed - the semantic network, the computer science analogies, the neurophysiological theories - each offer a glimpse into the brain's inner workings, a maze of interconnected nodes and pathways that defy easy navigation. And yet, it is in the very mystery of the brain that we find its beauty, a labyrinthine complexity that continues to inspire and perplex us, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of the human mind.",
            "A shadow looms over the precipice of progress, a specter of technology and capitalism that Huxley foresees in the dystopia of Brave New World. In this bleak future, the masses are conditioned to covet community above all else, their desires manipulated from the outset to prioritize fleeting pleasure. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, their ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller, a monolith of oppression.\n\nThrough the prism of Marxist theism, we discern the author's unease regarding the emergent systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores Huxley's commentary on the decay of the economy. Capitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common man is kept in the dark about the true nature of his relations to other classes, enthralled by the allure of personal gain. The World Controller's ideological stranglehold ensures that the Delta, Gamma, and other subjugated classes are bereft of free will, their desires honed by hypnopaedic conditioning to consume, indulge, and spend.\n\nThe notion of hegemony – the dominance of one group over others – is evident in this synthetic society. The lower classes are enthralled, unaware of the strings being pulled by the World Controller. The upper classes, those Alphas and Betas, are either complicit or apathetic, few like Bernard exhibiting a glimmer of resistance. The social interactions between individuals in Brave New World are stilted, lacking depth and nuance, a reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love and emotion are anathema, replaced by shallow, physical interactions, a far cry from the complexities of genuine human connection. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy serves as a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to accept their lot in life and conform to the expectations of their peers.\n\nThe bleak landscape of Brave New World is a dire warning of the consequences of unchecked technological progress and capitalist excess. Huxley's dystopia serves as a mordant critique of a society that values efficiency and consumption above all else, leaving humanity bereft of its soul.",
            "Four and a half semesters have passed since I set foot on the grounds of University Park. The campus sprawls before me like a dying ember, its limits shrouded in the haze of distance. I recall my freshman year, confined to an East Halls dorm room, a bastion of isolation amidst a sea of learning. The walk to class, a Sisyphean task, could consume up to 25 minutes of my day, particularly when the rain-lashed skies seemed to shatter the world around me. I spoke to an alumnus, a man barely older than myself, who shared with me the tale of a campus once bereft of the East Halls dorms, a desolate expanse of unused land. Now, that terrain has given way to an onslaught of sports fields, imposing structures, and encroaching apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the very notion of mobility becomes a will-o'-the-wisp, ever-elusive and fleeting.\n\nThe solution to this conundrum lies not in the bike itself, but in the willingness to ride it. The campus must be tailored to the needs of those who would traverse it on two wheels. I recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joys of bicycling after a lengthy hiatus. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to get around.\" Not only do they afford a modicum of exercise, but they also prove the most efficient means of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a measure of physical exertion can carry you 30 miles or more. As one who now resides off-campus, I, too, have come to appreciate the value of a bicycle. My daily commute to Thomas building, a walk that once consumed 25 minutes, now takes merely 5, provided I pedal with sufficient haste. However, my journey is not without its perils, for Pollock Road, the most direct route to my destination, proves a treacherous path, bike or no bike.\n\nWalking, too, holds its allure, though I fear I have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge in its leisurely pace. Were I to eschew my bicycle, walking would become my sole reliable means of traversing the campus. The added time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations would be a burden I could ill afford. The loss of time would be a heavy price to pay, a toll that would leave me with scarce moments to devote to my studies.\n\nAnd so, the bicycle remains my steadfast companion, a trusted ally in my daily quest to traverse this sprawling campus. It is a testament to the ingenuity of humanity, a humble machine that can carry me effortlessly across the terrain, freeing me from the drudgery of pedestrianism. As I navigate the twists and turns of University Park, I am reminded that the simplest solutions often prove the most elegant, and that the bicycle, far from a relic of a bygone era, remains an indispensable tool in our modern world."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to provide solace to the downtrodden and aid to the oppressed. It is a calling that speaks to the depths of my being, a calling that stirs within me a sense of duty and a desire to make amends for the suffering of others. The values that guide me in this pursuit are service, respect, and an unyielding commitment to ethical conduct. These are not merely ideals, but the very fabric of my existence, woven into the tapestry of my being.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of those in need, but the path that lay before me was shrouded in uncertainty. It was only through the trials and tribulations of others that I began to see my purpose. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, hiding behind a veil of denial, while others succumbed to coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their woes. It was in these moments of despair that I knew I had to act. I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a decision that would ultimately lead me to the threshold of a career in social work.\n\nThe summer of 2009 was a turning point for me. A chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy, ravaged by the brutal hand of abuse. His story lingered in my mind, a haunting reminder of the darkness that lurked in the shadows of our society. I was compelled to act, to do something, anything, to help. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a scene of turmoil and deception. The parents, shrouded in a web of denial, sought to deflect blame onto their son, labeling him a manipulator. In that moment, I knew that I had to take a stand. I shared my concerns with the police, and though they were bound by the constraints of the law, I vowed to continue my crusade against the cycle of abuse.\n\nThat encounter sparked a fire within me, a flame that burns bright to this day. It ignited a passion for social work, a desire to help those who have been ravaged by the brutal hand of society. I am drawn to the concept of social justice, a notion that has long been shrouded in hypocrisy. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we strive for conformity, for sameness. I refuse to be bound by these constraints. I am an individual, unapologetic and unafraid to challenge the status quo. I have walked the walk, protesting against injustice in all its forms: a bold declaration of self through my appearance, a steadfast commitment to fighting against racism and discrimination.\n\nMy journey is not one of self-discovery, but of purpose. I am driven by a sense of duty, a sense of responsibility to those who have been marginalized, to those who have been silenced. I will continue to fight against social injustice, to challenge the norms, to push against the boundaries that confine us. I will not be swayed by the whims of society, for I am a force to be reckoned with, a force for change.",
            "The desolate expanse of insomnia stretches out before us, a chasm of restless nights and wakeful days. The biological model, a sterile landscape of genes and neurons, attempts to chart the contours of this unyielding disorder. It is a realm where the hypothalamus reigns supreme, its neurons firing in a dance of sleep and wakefulness. The orexin neurons, those clandestine agents of the night, hold sway over the tides of slumber. And within them, a mystery unfolds, a tale of GABA receptors and their phenotypic manifestation in the mice.\n\nA study, a fleeting moment of insight, stirs the ashes of our understanding. The researchers, intrepid explorers of the somnambulant realm, discover that the GABAB receptor, that enigmatic sentinel of sleep, holds the key to the mysteries of the night. Its activation, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, coaxes the mice into a deep and dreamless sleep. But when its fires are extinguished, the darkness closes in, a shroud of anxiety and wakefulness. The GABAB agonist, a medicine for the afflicted, brings solace to the troubled mind, inducing sleep and quieting the storms of the night. The implications, a whispered promise of hope, speak to the genetic and environmental basis of this receptor in humans. A defect, a crack in the armor of the GABAB receptor, can unleash a maelstrom of sleeplessness, a torment that can shatter the very fabric of our lives.\n\nAnd yet, the sociocultural model, a tapestry of relationships and influences, whispers a different tale. It speaks of the intricate dance of environment and heredity, of the ways in which our surroundings and our genes conspire to shape our sleep patterns. The sociocultural factors, a complex web of factors, whisper secrets of the past, of the traumas and the triumphs that have shaped our lives. The researchers, intrepid cartographers of the human experience, chart the topography of this realm, mapping the contours of our sleep disorders.\n\nThe Dyssomnias, a collection of sleep disorders, unfold like a dark and foreboding landscape. Primary Insomnia, a thief in the night, steals our rest, leaving us shattered and worn. Primary Hypersomnia, a siren's call, beckons us to the land of the awake, where the shadows dance and the wind howls. Narcolepsy, a cruel mistress, holds us in her thrall, subjecting us to the whims of her dark and capricious nature. The Parasomnias, a band of misfits, roam the fringes of our consciousness, leaving in their wake a trail of terrors and unquiet dreams.\n\nAs we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must confront the darkness within ourselves. We must confront the ghosts of our past, the traumas and the triumphs that have shaped our lives. We must acknowledge the sociocultural forces that have molded us, the ways in which our environment and our genes have conspired to shape our sleep patterns. Only then can we begin to understand the true nature of insomnia, that insidious and unforgiving disorder that has taken hold of our lives.\n\nThe research, a fragile thread of insight, speaks to the genetic and environmental basis of this disorder. The study on mice, a fleeting moment of understanding, suggests that the GABAB receptor holds the key to our sleep patterns. The sociocultural model, a complex tapestry of relationships and influences, whispers secrets of the past, of the ways in which our surroundings and our genes have shaped our lives. But the truth, a mirage on the horizon, remains elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons us deeper into the heart of the desert. And so we must press on, driven by a burning need to understand, to unravel the mysteries of insomnia and to find solace in the darkness.",
            "The gray vastness of the mind, where sound and silence converge in a maelstrom of dissonance. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a labyrinth of the unquiet brain, where the echoes of the external world refuse to cohere into meaning. It is a realm of disquieting confusion, where the normally attuned ear finds itself lost and adrift in a sea of conflicting sounds.\n\nIn the earliest whispers of this disorder, the ghosts of \"auditory imperception\" haunted the shadows of the 1950s. Researchers, like specters in a dimly lit chamber, sought to grasp the elusive essence of this affliction. The Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari conjured forth tests in 1954, while Kimura, a sorceress of the mind, wove her spell of dichotic testing in 1961. The threads of their collective research began to weave a tapestry of understanding, though the outlines of this disorder remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs the years unfolded, the manifestations of CAPD began to reveal themselves, like the incremental layering of ash upon the charred remains of a once-green forest. The sufferer's ears, though not impaired by the external world, find themselves crippled by the silences that lie between the sounds. The spatial coordinates of sound are lost, as if the very fabric of reality had been torn asunder. The permutations of sound become a chaos of conflicting frequencies, a cacophony that defies the ear's futile attempts to impose order. The sounds of speech, like a whispered promise, are reduced to a jumble of indistinguishable whispers.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a puzzle, a riddle that requires the cunning of a puzzle-maker to unravel. Observers must scrutinize the listening behaviors of the afflicted, as if searching for the telltale signs of a wounded beast. Questionnaires and surveys, like the gentle probing of a physician, seek to grasp the depth of the disorder. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with the instruments of their trade, attempt to pierce the veil of confusion. Yet, the elusive nature of CAPD defies precise categorization, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and vanishes, leaving the seeker lost in the labyrinth of the mind.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, the teacher in a mainstreamed classroom finds themselves navigating a treacherous landscape. Like a guide through a blasted heath, they must thread the needle of accommodation, lest the fragile threads of the student's understanding be snapped by the harsh winds of misunderstanding. It is a delicate dance, a pas de deux between the teacher's words and the student's ear, where the slightest misstep may plunge the entire edifice into chaos.\n\nAnd so, the teacher must be aware of the red flags that signal the presence of CAPD: the mishearing of words, the failure to distinguish between competing sounds, the struggle to follow the thread of a conversation. Like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind, they must be attuned to the subtle cues of the disorder, lest the student become lost in the labyrinth of their own confusion.\n\nIn this way, the teacher becomes a guardian of the threshold, a sentinel who stands watch over the fragile boundary between sound and silence. It is a role that requires patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human heart, for it is in the depths of the mind that the true meaning of CAPD lies, a mystery that only the most sensitive of souls may dare to approach.",
            "In the morass of deception, where masks are worn to conceal the truth, Twelfth Night poses a question that hangs like a specter over the landscape: what cost does one pay for preserving the self, and what is the price of preserving relationships with others? The play suggests that donning a disguise, whether to deceive or protect, is a perilous game, one that risks losing oneself in the labyrinth of deception. The problem lies not only in the deception itself, but in the alienation that follows, a chasm that can never be fully bridged.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is a particularly treacherous terrain, fraught with unseen dangers and unspoken motivations. Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate attempt to preserve her own identity, to shield herself from the perils of a foreign land. Yet, this ruse not only isolates her from the women around her, but also sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her life. She becomes trapped in a web of confusion, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and Orsino's suppressed desires are unleashed, threatening to consume her.\n\nThis is not merely a cautionary tale of the dangers of deception, but a nuanced exploration of the human psyche, where the lines between truth and falsehood are blurred. The play suggests that deception can be a double-edged sword, one that can both conceal and reveal, shield and expose. In the case of Olivia, her attraction to Cesario is a complex tapestry of desire and deception, a dance between the appearance of a man and the reality of her own desires. Does she love Cesario for who he appears to be, or is it a deeper yearning that lies beneath the surface? The answer lies in the ambiguity of Olivia's character, a woman who judges others by their appearance, yet is herself a master of disguise.\n\nThe play's exploration of deception raises more questions than it answers, leaving the reader to ponder the consequences of our actions, and the cost of preserving our true selves in a world that often values appearance over reality. In the end, it is a testament to Shakespeare's genius that Twelfth Night remains a timeless and haunting work, a reflection of our own complexities, and the secrets we keep, and the masks we wear.",
            "The darkness of colonial rule has been a stain upon the conscience of nations, its brutality most starkly exemplified in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of German South West Africa. Yet, this singular event cannot encapsulate the totality of the German colonial empire's multifaceted nature. Policies and ruling styles varied as the lands themselves, a tapestry woven from diverse threads. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly kaleidoscopic, a reflection of the empire's capricious grasp.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika), they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the German efforts in that land. Contemporary authors lauded the educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies, a glowing testament to the empire's more benevolent aspects. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark and haunting contrast emerged. Unlike the East African model, where the government actively constructed state schools and nurtured the intellectual development of the native population, the task of education in South West Africa was abandoned to the charitable endeavors of missionary societies, their efforts woefully underfunded by the government.\n\nThe colonial authorities, however, did invest substantial resources in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a robust system of state schools and heavily regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching consequences, echoing through the annals of history long after German rule had ceased. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the empire's capricious nature.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, their tangled web a maze of cause and effect. This paper seeks to unravel these threads, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans, a subject hitherto veiled in obscurity. The literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and complex, with most sources penned in German and published during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works sought to chronicle the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies, laying the groundwork for future studies.\n\nLater writings in English expanded the discourse, conducting comparative analyses of education in the German colonies and delving into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, a testament to the empire's patchwork nature. Cohen's seminal work, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a beacon of insight into the factors that contributed to the divergence between these two colonies. According to Cohen, the sizable settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would come to define the relationship between colonizer and colonized.\n\nSouth West Africa boasted a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert expanses stretched across much of the territory. The European population, reflecting the colonizers' preference for fertile lands, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark contrast to the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population. This demographic disparity would come to shape the very fabric of the educational system, a system that would have far-reaching consequences for the native population, leaving an indelible mark on the collective memory of the region.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the classification of popular music has grown like a cancer, a festering sore that spreads its tendrils across the landscape. A century of proliferation has yielded a labyrinth of genres, each one a twisting, turning path that disappears into the darkness. And within these genres, sub-genres sprout like mushrooms after a spring rain, their delicate caps unfolding to reveal the rot within. Heavy Metal, that most primal and unforgiving of styles, has become the epicenter of this morass, a maelstrom of sound that churns with the fury of a tempest.\n\nIt is a movement born of darkness, a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. Metal is the music of the shadows, a cacophony of bass and volume that shatters the complacency of the mundane. It is a music of the wild and the savage, a primal scream that echoes through the void. And at its core, a sickness festers, a disease that spreads its tendrils through the very fabric of the music. It is a movement defined by its addiction to the darker aspects of the human experience, a morbid fascination with the abyss that yawns open like a chasm.\n\nIn the 1970s, a generation of musicians emerged, their minds afire with the madness of psychedelia. They crafted records that were at once otherworldly and visceral, their music a reflection of the chaos that raged within. And from these records, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence like a stain across the musical landscape. The Beatles, those vaunted icons of popular music, contributed to this movement with their own brand of darkness, their song \"Helter Skelter\" a twisted, nightmarish vision of the abyss that lay waiting.\n\nThe song was a response, a challenge to the Rolling Stones, those titans of rock, who had dared to tread the darker side of the emotional spectrum. And in doing so, the Beatles unleashed a maelstrom of sound that would forever change the face of music. Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would spread its influence far and wide, a cancer that would consume the very fabric of popular music.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a reflection of our own darkness, a manifestation of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music of the shadows, a music of the wild and the savage. And it is a music that will not be silenced, a cacophony that will continue to echo through the void, a reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of us all.",
            "In the crucible of his own tortured imagination, Henri Rousseau forged his dreams, both literal and figurative, a few decades before the Surrealists would later conjure their own dreamlike visions. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle, a perpetual quandary that haunted him throughout his career. On one hand, he yearned for the approbation of his peers and the art world he so fervently admired; on the other, he was drawn to the siren song of creative independence, the freedom to chart his own course, untethered by the conventions of his time.\n\nTo grasp the full import of The Dream, one must first immerse oneself in the labyrinthine narrative of Rousseau's life. Born on a fateful day in May 1844, in the provincial town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who basked in the comforts of bourgeois prosperity. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, Rousseau's path to artistic expression was fraught with uncertainty. Unencumbered by formal training, he toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. It was only then, in the aftermath of his wife Clémence's untimely passing, and the devastating loss of eight infant children, that Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge from his grief.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's oeuvre was inextricably linked to the hopes and aspirations of the common man. Unlike his contemporaries, who often sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's art was a testament to his own humble origins. His struggles to gain recognition in the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an advanced age, amidst a landscape dominated by the likes of Matisse and other modern masters. It was only when the latter's star began to rise that Rousseau's own artistic reputation began to gain traction.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, astutely observed that while both artists were technically adept, their motivations were as divergent as their styles. While Matisse shuddered at the prospect of painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau's desire was to craft works so conventionally alluring that they would secure his place among the Artiste Français. The Dream, with its portrayal of a woman awestruck by the wonders of a dream world, serves as a poignant manifestation of Rousseau's eternal conundrum: to conform to the standards of the art world or risk embracing the unconventional, the uncharted path of creative expression.",
            "In the unforgiving light of reason, philosophers have long posited a bond between the realm of ethics and that of aesthetics, between truth and beauty. It is a notion that resonates deeply, a hunch that there exists a hidden affinity between the two. As John Keats once penned in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We know that much of our understanding of the world is acquired through the rigors of education and experience. Yet, it seems that our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics arises not through instruction, but a more primal, instinctual grasp. Both endeavors are attempts to describe, not prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, efforts to distill the essence of why a piece of art or literature stirs the soul, or why an action is deemed just, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating. \n\nCriticism of art or morals is akin to trying to grasp a fistful of sand - the harder we squeeze, the more it slips through our fingers. A discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these mere words do not capture the depths of its beauty. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I propose that both art and morals can never be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we dissect the properties of a work of literature, there remains an intangible, transcendent quality that eludes our grasp. I suggest that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this enigmatic, unnamable essence that I believe is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that provides a connection point between them.\n\nI propose that morality and art are inextricably linked because we experience both most profoundly at a level that defies rational explanation. They impact us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This bond is even more pronounced when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany stretches across the vast expanse, a tattered tapestry woven from the disparate threads of a multitude of cultures. From the dark, granite spires of the Alps to the gray, unforgiving shores of the Baltic Sea, the very essence of Germany seems to seep from the earth itself. The Rhine River, a lifeblood, courses through the heart of the land, its waters whispering secrets to the ancient stones of Köln, while the Elbe River, a mournful sigh, flows through the Saxon city of Dresden. It is a land forged from the crucible of countless tribes and influences, a nation born of blood and fire.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, lies shrouded in mystery. The etymology of its name is a labyrinth of conflicting tales and ancient lore. Some say it hails from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others claim it was coined by the Gauls, a neighboring people they encountered across the Rhine. Julius Caesar, that great chronicler of conquest, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the subjugated Gauls and the free peoples beyond the river. The name, a whispered secret, was born from the very lips of the Gauls themselves.\n\nIn the scorching heat of summer, Caesar penned the words, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Yet others propose that the name Germania derives from the spear, a tool of war, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" a shout that echoes across the land. The Romans, those masters of the known world, saw fit to dub the Germans as aboriginal, a people pure and untainted by the tides of immigration.\n\nIn the dusty pages of Tacitus' \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale unfolds of a land untouched by the ravages of time. \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" Tacitus wrote, his words casting a veil of mystery over the land. \"For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, those mighty conquerors, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of awe and trepidation, their gaze lingering upon the rugged landscape, the unforgiving climate, and the unyielding spirit of its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged, they dwelled upon the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a whispered rumor, a hint of a world beyond the reach of the imperial gaze. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their loyalty a double-edged sword, forged in the fire of conquest and tempered by the iron will of their people. In this land of contrasts, where the Alps meet the sea, and the Rhine flows through the heart of Europe, Germany stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of a people forged in the crucible of time.",
            "Downwards I stared, my mind a vacant slate, a dull comprehension spreading through me like a slow-moving stain.  The view before me was a void, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with meaning.  I gazed upon it with a detached awareness, my thoughts drifting in and out like autumn leaves on a lazy stream.  My mind was a mill, its cogs turning in a smooth, relentless motion, each thought coalescing and then dissolving like the ebbing tide.  \n\nIn the past, I had sought to capture the world's beauty through the eyes of others.  A book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", had promised to teach me the secrets of art, to unlock the mysteries of perception and translate them into line and shape.  I had envisioned myself as a master, a weaver of worlds, a teller of tales.  But now, standing before the bowl, I was lost, adrift in a sea of detail, unable to impose order upon the chaos.\n\nI thought of the masters - Picasso, his blue phase a distant memory; Monet, his greens a verdant haven; the Renaissance artists, their colors a riotous explosion of light and life.  And I, a humble student, standing before my own canvas, my brush poised, ready to create.  But the picture before me was a mess, a jumbled tangle of lines and shapes, a maelstrom of color and form.  I felt the weight of my dreams, the crushing burden of my aspirations, bearing down upon me like a physical force.\n\nMy hand lifted, hesitant, unsure, and with a jerky, spasmodic motion, I struck the handle of the toilet.  The offending package remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence, a constant reminder of the futility of my efforts.  I stood, frozen, my mind a jumble of conflicting emotions, my hand gripping the mop with a sense of desperation, my tie constricting, a physical manifestation of the noose that was tightening around my neck.\n\nI stared at the package, a loathsome, repulsive thing, a reminder of the squalid reality that lay beneath the surface of my dreams.  And yet, I was drawn to it, fascinated by its ugly, mocking presence.  I felt a sense of kinship with it, a sense of shared humanity.  It was a thing, a object, a piece of the world, just as I was.  And in its refusal to yield, its stubborn, unyielding presence, I saw a reflection of my own futility, my own failure.\n\nI stood there, lost, confused, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, my hand hovering over the water, ready to dip into the abyss, to confront the reality that lay beneath the surface.  It was a moment of truth, a moment of reckoning, a moment that would change me forever.  And when I finally reached out, my hand dipping slowly into the water, it was not to create, but to confront, to face the ugliness, the mess, the squalor that lay before me.  It was a moment of surrender, a moment of acceptance, a moment that would set me free.",
            "In the somber stillness of a nation's reckoning, a dire statistic unfolds like a shroud over the youngest of drivers. Behind the wheel, they succumb to an unforgiving fate, their inexperience a woeful litany of error and misstep. The National Institutes of Health whisper a grim truth: the adolescent brain, still formative and unsteady, is ill-equipped to navigate the perils of the road. The pedestrian inexperience that accompanies this condition multiplies the risk of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and the cruel fate of driving off into the void.\n\nIn the silences between laughter and camaraderie, a harsh reality takes hold: the presence of peers in the passenger seat multiplies the danger. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has documented this correlation, a stark testament to the perils of youthful inexperience. The response, a provisional driver's license, a temporary salve that restricts hours and prohibits minors as passengers, is a hollow gesture, a stalling measure against the crushing weight of statistical evidence.\n\nThe real issue, a truth that refuses to be gainsaid, is that the youngest drivers, as a demographic, are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research has illuminated the inherent risk-taking tendencies of those under the age of 19 or 20, a proclivity for the thrill that cannot be ignored. It is a counsel of prudence, then, to delay the granting of a regular driver's license until the propensity for risk-taking has begun to ebb. To continue to issue licenses to young teens is to court disaster, to invite a death toll that will likely reach staggering proportions in the next few years. The Baby-Boomer's children, a demographic tidal wave, will soon be eligible to take the wheel, and the nation will be inundated with a new generation of inexperienced drivers.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be a straightforward matter of national will. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted prior to the issuance of a full license, with a certain number of practical training hours remaining a requirement. The specific number of hours, based on the standards already in place in most states, could serve as a benchmark. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teens across the nation, a bulwark against the rising tide of fatalities.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but a necessary measure to stem the tide of tragedy. It is a call to action, a summons to confront the stark reality of our nation's deadliest statistic. The time for action is now, before the next generation of drivers takes to the road, before the death toll reaches its apocalyptic peak. We must act, or risk being forever burdened by the knowledge of what might have been, of what we could have done to prevent the avoidable tragedy that unfolds before us.",
            "In the dusty recesses of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors. Fifteen trick films, born between 1895 and 1901, lay before me, their enchanting illusions a product of the era's creative editing prowess. My study of these films delved into the poetic underpinnings that governed the majority, while I scrutinized the evolutionary aberrations present in a select few of the later films. The trick films of the time, I discovered, adhered to a set of strict guidelines. They were bound by the confines of a frontal proscenium, shot in a static frame, bereft of camera movement, and adhering to the dogmatic rule of one shot equals one film. However, as the century turned, a few audacious films began to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations like multiple shots.\n\nA peculiarity common to these trick films was the choice of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained steadfast, unmoving, as figures and objects were confined to the static space. This compositional device drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic acts. A limitation inherent in this design was that figures could only move side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, like performers on a stage. Even as they exited the frame, the camera remained stationary, a frozen witness to their departure.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition governed the shot lengths, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity, a departure from the theatrical tradition where the audience beheld the entire performance within the proscenium's borders. In these early films, actors remained rooted to the middle ground, eschewing any movement towards the camera. As a result, close-ups were an alien concept, a narrative tool yet to be discovered.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. This constraint also circumscribed the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on brief vaudeville-style tricks – magic, disappearing acts, and switching maneuvers – bereft of any meaningful story. Yet, a closer examination revealed that the notion of a single shot was, in truth, a ruse. A solitary \"shot\" might comprise multiple joined segments, concealing the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In a land scorched by the unyielding sun, where the very earth seemed to writhe in agony, John Taylor of Caroline stood resolute, a testament to the unyielding fervor of his convictions. An agrarian by trade, his steadfast dedication to the land and its people forged an unshakeable bond between his profession and his unyielding advocacy for personal freedom and government restraint. The very notion of an agrarian system served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were founded.\n\nIn a world untainted by the weight of tradition, Taylor beheld an opportunity for the United States to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by the shackles of the past. He envisioned a government that would safeguard the inherent rights of man, those primal and sacrosanct entitlements that inhere in every individual, and which, if denied to one, would imperil the very fabric of society. These rights, he insisted, must remain beyond the reach of the government, lest the very essence of their value be diminished.\n\nTaylor's worldview was shaped by a stark dichotomy, a dualism that saw humanity as a battleground between good and evil. He posited that a government must be forged from the very metals of human nature, that its virtues and vices must be tempered by the fires of human experience. Good principles, he claimed, would protect private property, nurture agriculture, and eschew the grasping hand of capitalism, forging a society that operated in harmony with the public good. And though self-interest, that most insidious of motivations, would inevitably assert itself, it was only when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the weak that it became anathema.\n\nA good government, Taylor believed, was a bulwark against the encroaching darkness of human nature, a sentinel that stood vigilant against the insidious creep of corruption. And yet, even as it guarded against the forces of evil, it must be tempered by the wisdom of careful observation, lest the very principles it sought to uphold be corrupted by the avarice and self-interest that inhered in its administrators.\n\nTaylor's commitment to the strict construction of the Constitution was unyielding, his desire for a limited Federal government unshakeable. He saw an expansive government as a luxury that would inevitably degenerate into despotism, its costs mounting as its powers grew. And yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, for he knew that such an approach would lead to corruption, to an erosion of the very principles that had shaped the nation. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's fundamental essence as a collection of sovereign states, united in their quest for liberty.",
            "The data for the third month of the project betrayed a precipitous drop in submissions. It was a decline that brought with it a sense of desolation. The winter's chill had begun to seep into the bones of the campus, and the cycle of seasons had seemingly wrested away the fervor that drove people to record their commutes. It was as if the world itself had turned gray and still, leaving naught but the faint outline of purpose.\n\nSome might say that the fall of the semester, the culmination of work and the ushering in of winter's darkness, was to blame. Others might point to the holiday season, a time when the campus lay dormant, its halls empty and still. But neither of these explanations held sway, for the truth was that the decline had begun long before the semester's end. It was a slow erosion, a gradual wearing away of the will to participate.\n\nAnd yet, as the winter's grip tightened, a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon. The Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of energy and fervor, brought a surge of new submissions. It was a fleeting respite, a reminder that the project still had life, but it also underscored the fragility of momentum. For in the face of the project's natural decline, it seemed that even the most well-crafted incentives were insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nThe problem was not simply one of engagement, but of a deeper, more ingrained habit. The freedom to drive, the independence it afforded, and the flexibility it brought were deeply ingrained in the culture. It was a siren's call, a lure that proved difficult to resist. And so, the project found itself beset on all sides by the twin challenges of decline and the siren's song of independence.\n\nIn the end, it was a question of how to overcome these obstacles, of how to find a way to entice people to abandon their cars and take up the cause. Perhaps it was not the prizes themselves that were the problem, but the lack of imagination in their conception. The gift cards, once a novelty, had grown stale and uninteresting. But what if the prizes were to be something more? What if, for instance, a bicycle or a hybrid car were to be given away? Would that have been enough to stem the tide of decline? It was a question that haunted the project, a reminder that the line between success and failure was thin indeed.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the market, a peculiar creature emerged - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF. This wretched beast, born of human ingenuity, promised to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets, but with a flexibility that belied its roots. Like a mockingbird mimicking the siren's call, it enticed investors with the promise of diversification, sans the shackles of traditional mutual funds. The ETF's expense ratios danced in the wind, a mocking parody of the average mutual fund's bloated costs. However, like a whispered rumor, the seeds of doubt were sown - the necessity of commissions on each trade, a cruel reminder that even the most enticing promises come with a price.\n\nYet, the ETF's allure persisted, a siren's call to the savvy investor. A vast array of funds beckoned, a tapestry woven from the threads of the market's tapestry. But, like a threadbare cloak, the ETF's benefits must be scrutinized, its very fabric torn asunder to reveal the truth. In this exercise, we shall dissect the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and dissect its constituent parts. We shall follow the thread of its top 10 holdings, those that comprise 63.58% of its assets, and unravel the tapestry of their performance.\n\nTo avoid the labyrinthine complexity of the entire ETF, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that hold sway over the majority of its assets. Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets, and the calculations of their Beta and Return, should they form the sole components of a portfolio.\n\nThe chart below reveals a truth - a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio would be .12 lower than that of the ETF. However, like a mirage on the horizon, the question remains - are these differences statistically significant?\n\nTo answer this riddle, we shall turn to the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results of this exercise shall reveal whether the ETF's benefits are a chimera or a reality, whether the diversification it promises is a myth or a truth.",
            "The forgotten realms of Dream-Land, a realm of shadows and the lost, where the echoes of the past reverberate like a dirge in the void. It was here that Edgar Allan Poe chose to set his poem, a dark and haunting landscape that mirrored the depths of his own troubled soul. And within this forsaken land, the whispers of the ancients beckoned, their secrets waiting to be unearthed. \n\nThe term \"Thulé\" - a name that echoed through the chambers of Poe's mind like a mournful sigh - held within it the weight of history and the whispered secrets of the unknown. It was a word that conjured the specter of Virgil, that ancient Greek writer who spoke of an isle beyond the edge of the known world. But the true source of this enigmatic term lay hidden, shrouded in the mists of time. Poe's fascination with German authors, particularly Goethe, led him down a path of discovery, a labyrinth of words and meanings that revealed the darkness that lay at the heart of the human condition.\n\nGoethe, a master of the poetic drama, had woven a tale of Faust, a tale of a man consumed by his own desires, a man who danced with the devil and paid the ultimate price. And within this tale lay a hidden poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a poem of a king who, lost and alone, wanders the desolate shores of a world bereft of color, haunted by the memory of his lost love. It was a poem that spoke to the very essence of Poe's own soul, a poem that echoed the darkness that lay at the heart of his own being.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" was no mere coincidence. It was a deliberate choice, a nod to the masterful Goethe, a acknowledgment of the debt he owed to the great German writer. And the poem itself, a dark and haunting landscape of shadows and lost love, was a companion piece to Goethe's own \"The King of Thulé\". It was a poem of a man lost in a world without color, a world that echoed the darkness that lay within his own soul.\n\nIn his own words, Poe spoke of his respect for Tennyson, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his being. The reproductions of Goethe's work, the echoes of his words, had seeped into Poe's consciousness, shaping his own writing, his own soul. And in the forgotten realms of Dream-Land, the whispers of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" whispered secrets to Poe, secrets of the human condition, secrets of the darkness that lay at the heart of us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of California law, a query arises like a specter from the dust: could a customer, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages for slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, citing the store manager's callous disregard for her safety? The manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, yet allowed it to persist for a half-hour, too engrossed in his dinner to tend to the mess. Was this a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages?\n\nA judge, a sentinel of justice, would not likely summarily dismiss Palmer's claim. To substantiate her claim, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were committed with a wilful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his conduct, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer may argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the previous incidents of customers slipping in the months prior to her accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may be less compelling, it is still a reasonable assertion, given the five slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009, and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn that fateful October 13th, at 5 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the spill in an aisle. Martin, consumed by his dinner break, disregarded the warning, willfully ignoring the potential harm that could befall his customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference, leaving the spill to persist for an additional quarter-hour. It was at 5:30 pm that Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury, a consequence of Martin's inaction.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" The courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe question remains: did Martin's actions constitute a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, a despicable act that warranted punitive damages? The evidence suggests that he did, and Palmer's case may yet prevail, a testament to the enduring power of justice in the face of indifference and neglect.",
            "It has been nearly four winters since I set foot in a classroom, endeavoring to grasp the intricacies of Islam at the CBC.  The memories of heated debates still linger, like the ghosts of winter's chill.  One discussion that lingers in my mind is the notion of whether Islam is a faith of hostility or one of benevolence.  As the years have unfolded since the shadow of 9/11 fell across the world, I've watched the media's stance shift from a posture of hostility to one of indulgent tolerance.  It was inconceivable in 2001 that a leader with the name Barack Obama, whose lineage bears the mark of Islam, would ascend to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a certain allure for me.  It is a tale of contrasts, one that seems to defy the notion of its subject.  Muhammad, as I once believed, was a man who forged conquests through violence and coercion, compelling others to adopt the faith of Islam.  Yet, the biography paints a different portrait - that of a martyr, a man misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before others.  It was through this gentle approach that people, one by one, came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nA certain mirroring of the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad struck a discordant note within me.  The most striking example is the tale of the multiplied mutton and milk, which seemed to echo the style of writing that aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove anything, but rather lived in the radiance of truth and miracles.  This approach, however, serves only to diminish the life and person of Jesus Christ, to borrow from his legacy and pass it off as one's own.  It is a form of thievery, a theft of the divine.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories that appear to be crafted to provide evidence of the convert's free will, to demonstrate that people came to Islam of their own accord.  But these tales, passed down through third-party narrators, strike me as suspect.  The narrative is compromised by its reliance on hearsay, its stories diluted by the whispers of others.  This method, intended to prove the truth of the stories, only serves to undermine their authenticity.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly stature, to portray him as a humble, endearing, wise, and gentle soul.  History, however, reveals a different tale, one of power and conquest.  I am left to wonder if the adherents of Islam are aware of the true narrative of Muhammad's rise to power, the delicate balance of politics and bloodshed that led to his ascension.",
            "In the depths of time, the teachings of Jesus were forsaken, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of Christian thought that sprawled forth like a bloated beast, consuming all in its path. The farther one ventured from the origin, the more the creature strayed, a slow and inexorable drift into the darkness. The world today is witness to an insidious creep, a progressive tide that threatens to engulf the traditionalists, those who cling to the dogma of old. Their voices, a faint whisper in the void, may soon be drowned out by the growing chorus of those who seek to reclaim the truth. A yearning will arise, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the core of the faith. It will be a slow and tortuous process, one that will take decades, perhaps centuries, but the outcome is inescapable: the clock will turn back, and Christianity will be remade in the image of its namesake.\n\nA great reversal will sweep across the land, a movement that will gather momentum and power, its numbers swelling like a dark and unstoppable tide. The church, that venerable institution, will remain, a steady hand guiding the faithful through the tumultuous waters of history. But the theological tide will have shifted, and the diversity that once characterized Christendom will give way to a growing uniformity. The differences that once divided will fade, like the ebbing of a once-mighty river, until all that remains is a shared understanding, a common purpose.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The once-mighty Roman Empire, which once condemned Christians to the flames, would later become a bastion of the faith. Our nation, too, has known such a transformation, from the shackles of slavery to the leadership of the African-American people. And so it will be with Christianity, as the faithful seek to reclaim the source, to strip away the layers of doctrine and return to the essence of the faith. It will require a new way of reading the words of Jesus, a recognition that they are not literal statements, but metaphorical keys to a deeper truth.\n\nLooking back, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring from which Christianity flowed. The Hebrew scriptures, the authority of a single, all-powerful God, and the conviction of a divinely revealed truth – these were the hallmarks of the faith by the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own. But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolith, divided as they were into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. The same divisions that once rent the Jewish people asunder will soon be mirrored in the Christian world, as the faithful strive to reclaim the truth, to peel back the layers of doctrine and reveal the heart of the faith.",
            "The Jungle reveals the insidious nature of humanity. Beneath the façade of civility, men and women are driven by an unyielding self-interest, ever intent on elevating their own station at the expense of others. This perfidious tendency is starkly illustrated in the ranks of the factory owners and managers, their avarice and disregard for the well-being of others a stark and unyielding force. The behemoths of industry they oversee stand as monoliths, their chimneys belching forth a noxious haze that billows across the landscape like a shroud, casting a dark shadow over all that lies within its reach. The stench of pollution and decay clings to the very air itself, a tangible manifestation of the callous disregard with which these masters of industry view the fragile lives of those they employ.\n\nTheir employees, toiling in the depths of the factories, are but mere cogs in a machine, their worth measured solely in terms of their utility to the enterprise. The owners and managers are unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed on the ledger, where the ledger entries dance and swirl with the endless pursuit of profit. The workers toil and struggle, their hours lengthened, their pay pittance, their future uncertain. And when they falter, they are cast aside, discarded like so much trash, their memories erased from the ledgers, their very existence forgotten.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set is a time of great darkness, a time when the rule of law was lax, and the powerful were unaccountable. The workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and desperation, were forced to conform to the whims of their masters, their every move circumscribed by the harsh realities of their existence. The unions, formed in the hope of redressing the balance, often proved little more than a charade, their leadership corrupted by the very system they sought to challenge. The workers, like slaves in a forgotten era, were bound to the whims of their masters, their lives reduced to a mere existence, devoid of hope or dignity.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, the line between right and wrong is blurred, and the strong prey upon the weak. It is a world in which the very notion of humanity is distorted, where the pursuit of self-interest is the only guiding principle. And in this desolate realm, the workers of Packingtown toil, their lives a testament to the inhumanity that lies at the heart of their world.",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to impart a particular sentiment or disposition towards pivotal subjects. These methods can be more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this with his deployment of disparate word pairings in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs adjectives with nouns in an unconventional manner to imbue a particular aura around a subject. Additionally, Fitzgerald attributes significance to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a specific meaning. He exercises this latter technique with various colors, most notably white, gray, and the dichotomy of red and pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald constructs a nuanced understanding of white and gray, and later leverages this understanding to elicit a specific emotional response from the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white connoting a superior, refined quality and gray signifying age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this association at the commencement of the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white\" (8), and their attire is not the only instance of this phenomenon - Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to attend Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). Conversely, the only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls\" are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color-coded meanings by applying them to mundane, unimportant subjects: as Nick travels to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of partygoers are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is situated in a \"long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). He also employs these colors to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald utilizes these colors to signify uniformity or unimportance in various subjects. This technique commences with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74); readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform aspect, a mere accessory that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to convey the impression of her being a uniform, inconsequential element, exemplified by the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The land of San Diego County - a place of verdant plenty, where the sun's warm touch ignites the earth and brings forth a bounty of life. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, citrus fruits burst with sweetness, and leafy greens grow lush in the mild climate. The air is heavy with the scent of squash and broccoli, and the trees bear an abundance of peaches and lemons. The earthy richness of herbs and the sweetness of berries and honey mingle with the spicy tang of peppers, a medley of flavors born of the land's fertility.\n\nBut this land, so bountiful and green, holds a secret. Beneath its surface, the weight of history presses down upon it. The Native Americans who once walked these hills, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who followed, all have left their mark. The land's memory is a palimpsest, a layering of stories and struggles, of triumphs and defeats. The original homestead patent, a document of ownership and possession, serves as a tangible reminder of the land's storied past.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to till this land, would do well to consider the weight of history. The temptation to clear the land, to tame its wild beauty, would be great. But the rewards of organic farming, though greater in the long run, would come at a cost. The labor would be intense, the management of pests and weeds a constant struggle. The soil, too, would require care, a gentle coaxing to bring forth its full potential. And yet, the benefits would be worth it: a land teeming with life, a diverse tapestry of plants and animals, a haven for those who seek refuge.\n\nThe land in question, a parcel of 160 acres adjacent to the town of Potrero, lies in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The Cleveland National Forest looms nearby, a sentinel of the wild. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its infancy, seeks to protect the delicate balance of this ecosystem. Over a hundred species of plants and animals are considered, many of them endangered, others on the precipice of extinction.\n\nA small farmer, seeking to make a living from this land, would need guidance, expertise, and resources. The government programs, designed to aid small-scale farmers, would be a lifeline, a means of supporting the delicate balance of this ecosystem. An organic farm in the area, a model of what could be achieved, would serve as a beacon, a testament to the power of gentle husbandry.\n\nThe land, a palimpsest of stories, holds within it the potential for redemption. A small farmer, willing to listen to its whispers, could coax forth a bounty of life, a celebration of the beauty and diversity of this sacred earth.",
            "It is in the dusty, worn pages of human interaction where the weight of culture is most palpable. Culture, a chameleon of nuanced understandings, defies simplicity, its essence existing in the spaces between what it is and what it represents. It does not reside in the tidy confines of a single definition, nor can it be reduced to the sweeping generalizations that often accompany it. To say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is to speak in hushed tones of a stranger, a faint echo of truth that dissipates upon closer inspection.\n\nIn the realm of negotiation, culture is a behemoth that must be approached with reverence and humility. The act of understanding a foreign culture is a slow dance, one that begins with the recognition of its own complexities and the inevitability of comparisons. It is a labyrinth of twisted corridors and half-remembered histories, where the air is thick with the whispers of prejudices and the heavy scent of tradition.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, a negotiator must eschew judgment and instead choose to accept the culture for what it is, in all its messy, beautiful glory. Within the sterile halls of negotiation, respect for the traditions and beliefs of the other is the only currency that can truly be exchanged. And it is here, in the give-and-take of give-and-take, that the true power of culture is revealed: its capacity to both unite and divide, to bind and to break.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be neatly categorized as national or international. It seeps into the marrow of companies, establishments that pulse with their own unique rhythms and cadences. A corporate culture might prize the long hours of the office or the relaxed rhythms of a bygone era. In the way employees dress, communicate, and hire, the contours of a company's culture are revealed. Some companies are bastions of philanthropy, while others are more cautious, their benevolence carefully calibrated.\n\nAnd so, too, the values that underpin a culture are a complex tapestry of why and how. If saving face or communal harmony are the bedrock of a culture, a negotiator will not risk sullying his company's reputation at the negotiating table. Conversely, a culture that prizes the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by the twin siren songs of compromise and concession. To navigate these waters, a negotiator must be attuned to the subtle vibrations of his opponent's culture, to the hidden harmonics that shape their very being.\n\nBut to truly succeed, a negotiator must do more than simply grasp the broad strokes of a culture. He must delve deeper, into the intricate web of personal histories and motivations that underpin the negotiation. It is in this pursuit of understanding that the true art of negotiation is revealed: a delicate dance of give-and-take, of give and take, of understanding and respect.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human heart, a void yawns with the words of the fool: \"There is no God.\" A phrase born of the ancient Psalm 14, an affirmation echoed by the venerable St. Anselm in his unyielding defense of the divine. Yet this conviction finds kinship in the argument of Thomas Aquinas, a union of purpose that warrants scrutiny. We shall delve into the depths of their reasoning, assuming as a guiding principle that both are correct in their assertion of God's existence, specifically the biblical God. Any deviation from this premise would distort the comparison, for their arguments are rooted in the singular notion of a supreme being.\n\nTo evaluate their theses, we must first consider Anselm's pathway to understanding. His creed posits that the proof of God resides within the recesses of the self. By introspection, one discovers the existence of God through the unshakeable certainties that reside within. This idea, though oft shrouded in the labyrinthine language of the theologian, is a notion that faith is not a necessary adjunct to reason, but rather an intrinsic aspect of human perception. Anselm's words suggest that truth lies within, a self-contained concept that supersedes empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more austere view. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical observation, obviating the need for faith. This stance holds promise for evangelism, as it affords the prospect of attracting converts through logic, unencumbered by the burden of unverifiable claims. Aquinas' quintet of logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – serves as the foundation for his assertion. Each presents a rational pathway to the conclusion that God's existence is a logical necessity. The notion that a puzzle, though incomplete, reveals its missing piece through the interconnectedness of the remaining elements is a testament to the power of reason in illuminating the divine.\n\nHowever, both Anselm and Aquinas fall short in providing a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while formidable, are insufficient to bridge the chasm between the abstract and the tangible. The existential void within the human experience remains, an abyss that their reasoning cannot fully suffuse.",
            "In the unremembered time of the ancients, a prince was born who would one day be called Buddha. His life unfolded like a dark and winding river, guiding him toward the shores of enlightenment. The teachings he would bring forth would form the bedrock of Buddhism, a river of doctrine that would flow through the ages, its waters changing with the seasons, yet remaining constant in their essence. The most traditional of these waters, Theravada, had flowed for over two and a half millennia, its banks altered by the capricious tides of time. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony of water-cutting was observed, a tradition that seemed to flow from the very bedrock of the religion, yet was born of a silence in the teachings of the Buddha. This divergence was but one example of the many changes that had taken place, from the superficial trappings of tradition to the fundamental truths of the soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, had been shaped by forces both within and without, some hostile, some benign.\n\nThe dichotomy of internal and external forces would be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force was one born of the Buddhist community itself, regardless of monastic status, while an external force was any influence from outside the fold. A hostile force was one that sought to damage or destroy the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith, while a benign force was one that neither sought to harm nor to help, though its effects may have been far-reaching nonetheless. These terms would be woven throughout the tapestry of this discourse.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, one must delve into the fundamental doctrines that underpinned the faith. Buddhists sought refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma was comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture, each one a vessel filled with the waters of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contained the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka held the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka concealed the metaphysical secrets of the faith. These metaphysical notions – Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things – held the key to unlocking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara. By recognizing these truths, one could escape the prison of lobha, dosa, and moha, the desire, hatred, and delusion that bound humanity to the wheel of suffering.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka laid out the rules for living, five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lay the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome. These truths, like the waters of a river, flowed through the ages, shaping the landscape of the faith, ever-changing, yet remaining constant in their essence.",
            "In the arid expanse of time, two nations stood as rival sentinels, their animosity forged in the crucible of discord and tempered by the fires of conflict. The United States and Mexico, bound by a shared border, yet pitted against each other in a struggle that spanned nigh on 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The conflict's zenith was the Mexican-American War, a cataclysmic conflagration that ravaged the landscape and left in its wake a scarred and divided landscape. The United States emerged victorious, its dominion over Texas and the American Southwest a testament to its unyielding resolve.\n\nYet, this was not an isolated aberration, for the roots of this rivalry ran deep, nurtured by the divergent threads of culture, tradition, and faith. The clash of material interests, a siren's call to discord, further exacerbated the schism between the two nations. As the years accumulated, the wounds of the past festering like an open sore, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico seemed an intractable problem, a Gordian knot that refused to be untangled.\n\nAnd yet, it is a phenomenon that has played out time and again, a cycle of enmity and distrust that echoes through the annals of history. Nations bound by geography, yet sundered by the fault lines of difference, their relationships strained by the competing claims of self-interest. David M. Pletcher's words, a Cassandra's warning, still resonate: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The shared border, a fragile membrane separating two worlds, proved a brittle barrier against the encroaching tides of discord.\n\nReligious animosity, a potent catalyst for conflict, had long been a specter haunting the relationship between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm's observation, a piercing insight, cuts to the heart of the matter: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm, a seemingly insurmountable divide, threatened to consume the fragile dialogue between the two nations.\n\nThe legacy of colonialism, a toxic inheritance, continued to poison the relations between the United States and Mexico. The distrust, a festering wound, was a reflexive reaction to the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. The echoes of this past, a lingering shadow, continued to shape the present, a ghostly presence that refused to be exorcised.\n\nDiehl and Goerts' catalog of 17 disputes, a grim litany, serves as a testament to the depth of the rivalry. Territorial disputes, a recurring theme, seemed an intractable problem, a roadblock to any meaningful rapprochement. Border raids, a scourge on both sides, only served to further inflame the tensions between the two nations.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the dynamics of power began to shift, and the United States' ambitions, like the tides, began to ebb and flow. Mexico, once a proud and independent nation, became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor, a circumstance that ultimately sapped the vitality of the rivalry. As American interests shifted from territorial aggrandizement to economic domination, the tempests of discord began to subside, and a fragile peace took hold.",
            "Fifteen years ago, a shadow crept in, unseen and uninvited, and claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, a stalwart guardian of the vulnerable, but I had never known its name, nor had I ever imagined its power to reduce me to nothing. My childhood had been a patchwork of uncertainty, a quilt of worn frayed edges, and the mantra that had sustained me was that of a certain solace: 'There will always be work, for people will always fall ill.' And so, I had chosen nursing, a profession that promised a semblance of security, a fortress against the tempests of life.\n\nBut now, I am 46 years old, my bank account a hollow shell, my body a fragile vessel, and my future a labyrinth of uncertainty. Social Security Disability has been my meager sustenance for fifteen years, a constant reminder that I am no longer the pillar I once was. Each day is a struggle, a battle to preserve what little remains of my dignity, my security, and my self-worth. The world outside is a harsh and unforgiving place, and I am but a small, battered leaf on a windswept tree.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this desolation, there is one truth that I hold fast: I could not have endured these long, dark years without the kindness of my loved ones and a few loyal friends. They have been my lifeline, my shelter from the storm, and I am forever in their debt. When disaster strikes, as it inevitably will, we do not stand alone; we are but threads in a tapestry of human connection, fragile and vital.\n\nWe live in a world that worships the notion of individual strength, of rugged self-reliance, but I say to you: it is a myth, a Potemkin village of self-sufficiency. Our forebears did not conquer the wilderness alone; they walked in the footsteps of those who had come before, their hands extended in offering and acceptance. They knew that in the face of the unknown, we are but fragile, vulnerable creatures, and that the only true strength lies in the bonds we weave with one another.\n\nSo, be prepared, I say. Prepare your disaster kit, your first aid supplies, your water purifying tablets. Learn to can and preserve your own food, to tend a wood stove, to navigate the dark. But do not forget the most important resource of all: the human heart. Learn to trust your neighbors, to ask for help, to offer it in return. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will see us through, but the threads of connection that bind us, frail and resilient, to one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do is one that has long plagued the minds of biologists and scholars. Like a river that winds its way through the barren landscape, the path of evolution is shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, writing in 1917, confessed that the zoologist had yet to grasp the simplicity of defining organic forms in mathematical terms. And yet, it is precisely this pursuit that has driven scientists to apply mathematical modeling to the complex processes of mollusk skeletogenesis. In our study, we seek to explore the intersection of mathematical modeling and experimental investigation in the realm of Prunum, in order to uncover the hidden mechanisms that guide the trajectory of evolutionary change.\n\nWe began by examining the skeletal morphologies of Prunum species, using X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters that govern their growth and development. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a software program called CerioShell, allowing us to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to shed light on the grand narrative of macroevolutionary events in this enigmatic clade.\n\nConsider the shell of a mollusk, a twisting, turning tube that traverses the expanse of space and time. Each revolution of the shell is a whorl, a spiral turn that wraps around an invisible axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls emerge can vary, like the ebb and flow of a tide, and a line of demarcation, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is the culmination of this spiral journey, while the spire, like a majestic tower, stretches towards the apex.\n\nIn our quest to understand the shell's morphology, we must consider its various aspects: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Each of these perspectives offers a unique insight into the shell's structure, like the shifting sands of a desert dune. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer, is the most familiar, yet it is in the other views that we find the hidden patterns and codes that govern the shell's growth.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must first gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture marks the beginning of a new revolution. A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to the nearest quarter-turn. This process is akin to tracing the path of a river, following the course of the aperture as it winds its way through time and space.\n\nThe trajectory of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented, like a map of a forgotten land. By varying parameters and modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis, we can explore the possibilities of evolutionary change, and perhaps, uncover the secrets that lie hidden in the shell's twisted, turning form.",
            "In the shadow of progress, the statistics whispered a haunting refrain.  In the land of a thousand islands, a nation's heartbeat faltered.  The numbers remained static, a grim testament to the fragility of life.  Indonesia's infant mortality rate, a metric of a society's very soul, stagnated, refusing to budge.  The country's strides in water and sanitation targets were a hollow victory, a Pyrrhic triumph in the face of unyielding child and maternal health woes.\n\nA veil of complacency shrouded the nation, as if the achievements in skilled birth attendance were a beacon of hope, a shining star in the dark expanse of need.  But the truth lay in the shadows, in the traditional workers, the midwives, who held the power to seal life or snuff it out.  The statistic of 72% hid the desperation of a mother's plea, the anguish of a life cut short by a preventable hemorrhage.  The numbers whispered of a woeful need, a call to strengthen the very fabric of the health system, rather than tinkering with programmatic interventions.\n\nThe decline in diarrheal cases treated by a health professional was a symptom of a greater malaise, a disease that ate away at the very foundations of a nation.  Postnatal care, a vital lifeline, hung in the balance, its rates a testament to the country's neglect.  The cesarian-section rates, a mere 4%, a stark reminder of the chasm between urban and rural, between the haves and have-nots.  The urban elite, ensconced in their privileged world, oblivious to the struggles of the rural poor, who toiled in the shadows, denied access to the very services that could save their lives.\n\nThe inequity of coverage, a cancer that ate away at the nation's core, left the poor to suffer, their cries drowned out by the cacophony of statistics and promises.  The 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles was a stark reminder of a system in shambles, a health care system that prioritized the privileged few over the many.  The out-of-pocket costs, a burden that crushed the poor, a weight that suffocated their dreams, their hopes.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the question echoed, a haunting refrain, a call to action: how to bridge the chasm, how to bring light to the darkness?  Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, a behemoth that trembled on the brink of collapse?  The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable results, beckoned, a siren's song.  But beware, for in their haste, they risked creating a Frankenstein's monster, a system that devoured resources, leaving other areas to wither and die.\n\nThe drawbacks of such an approach haunted the shadows, a specter of duplication, of uncoordinated services, of forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of bureaucracy.  The ghosts of previous failures whispered caution, a warning of the perils of prioritizing one sector over another, of the devastating impact on the poor, who bore the brunt of the neglect.  In this dance of failure, only one question remained, a question that haunted the halls of power: how to strengthen the health system, to bring light to the darkness, to save the lives of a nation's most precious resource, its children?",
            "In the stifling grandeur of the Victorian era, two novels stand as anomalies - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Like aberrant flowers blooming in a well-manicured garden, these works burst forth with an unbridled ferocity, shattering the stifling conventions of their peers. The aristocracy, once the sole focus of the era's literary landscape, recedes into the shadows as the characters in these novels assume center stage, their motivations and emotions a tangled skein of mystery and heartache.\n\nLike a maelstrom of chaotic thoughts, a dizzying array of ideas beset the protagonist of Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these dreamlike states, the mysteries that unfold reveal the labyrinthine depths of the protagonist's inner world, their pain and awareness of the darkness that surrounds them. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, is a gruesome reminder of the loss of control that has beset him. As he relives the event in vivid detail, the boundaries between reality and dreams blur, and the extent of his despair becomes clear. The pain that has become his constant companion now thunders through his mind like a relentless drumbeat, fueling his fear and despair. And yet, it is not his own will that has brought about his misfortune, but the cruel hand of fate, its unseen forces bearing him away like a leaf on a gust of wind.\n\nIn this darkness, a sense of defeat settles over Oliver like a shroud. His will, once a flame that flickered brightly, has been extinguished, leaving only a faint ember of hope. It is as if the malevolent forces that surround him have succeeded in breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept a fate that is not his own. And so, like a bird in a gilded cage, Oliver is trapped, unable to fly, his wings clipped by the very hands that once promised him freedom.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the day itself becomes a mocking taunt, a cruel reminder of the transience of life. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\" The eternal cycle of day and night, once a comforting rhythm, now seems a heartless, uncaring mechanism, devoid of warmth or comfort. And in this desolate landscape, the characters of both novels are forged, their fates inextricably linked to the dark, unforgiving forces that surround them.",
            "The winter of the mind, when the ice of ignorance rends the tender shoots of understanding, that was the season I first encountered the boy Adrian. A third-grader, his brow furrowed in concentration, his eyes squinting against the glare of a text that refused to yield its secrets. I was tasked with guiding him through the labyrinth of English, a Sisyphean endeavor that would prove to be a test of wills. His mother, a woman who spoke only in the whispers of her native tongue, arrived unannounced, a silent presence that punctuated the hum of our after-school program. The language barrier that separated us was a chasm, a divide that yawned wide and deep, yet it was in this very moment that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's struggles were not with the words, but with their symbols. The English alphabet, a mysterious script that defied his comprehension.\n\nAs I struggled to convey this epiphany to the boy, the truth settled upon me like a shroud. The problems that plagued Adrian were not unique, but rather a symptom of a greater malady: the language barrier that afflicted our schools, a wound that bled into the very fabric of our community. California, a tapestry woven from the threads of cultures, languages, and histories, was a microcosm of this issue. The solution, much like the solution to Adrian's struggles, lay not in a single panacea, but in a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty, offered a glimmer of promise. By embracing the languages of our students, by acknowledging the diverse threads that comprised our community, we could create a tapestry of understanding. The research was clear: children who participated in two-way bilingual education programs outperformed their peers academically. Yet, fear and misconception clouded the issue, leading us to view this approach as a luxury, a indulgence that we could ill afford.\n\nBut what if we were to invert this thinking? What if we were to view bilingual education as a necessity, a cornerstone upon which our educational edifice was built? The solution did not lie in requiring teachers to be bilingual, a prospect that seemed as unrealistic as it was unreasonable. Rather, it lay in providing support, in offering the tools and resources that would empower our educators to bridge the gap. Bilingual aides, tutors, or simply, guides – the terminology mattered little – what mattered was the understanding that language was not a barrier, but a bridge, a means to connect, to communicate, and to understand.\n\nIn the end, it was not the solution that was complex, but the problem. The key lay not in a single answer, but in a multifaceted approach, one that acknowledged the diversity of our community, and the complexity of the language barrier that threatened to divide us. By embracing this complexity, by weaving together the threads of our languages, our cultures, and our histories, we could create a tapestry of understanding, a fabric that would envelop us all, and guide us forward into a brighter future.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been instilled within us since we first took our first faltering steps. It is a notion peddled by the guardians of our youth, the preachers and the scholars, the mystics and the wise men. Some among us are schooled in the dogma of Sunday morning, while others seek solace in the ancient rituals of the Temple. Still, others seek to forge their own paths, to chart their own courses through the void. We wander, drawn by the siren song of the unknown, ever searching for a lighthouse to guide us through the desolate expanse.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two dark pools, stared out into the rain-lashed evening. The droplets pattered against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that seemed to underscore the weight of his own mortality. He had grown gaunt, his frame a mere specter of its former self, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt the coldness of his hand as I took it in mine, the desperate need to hold onto him, to keep him from slipping away. The rain drummed on, a relentless cadence that seemed to mock our feeble attempts at connection.\n\n\"I like cardinals,\" he said, his voice barely audible above the din of the rain. His eyes, those dark pools, seemed to gaze right through me, searching for something in the depths of the past. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I watched him, my heart heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nHe passed into the great unknown on a cold December morning, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, those brutal, soul-sucking treatments, had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't say. What kind of deity would do this to a man, to a father, a husband, a brother? I thought, and my anger boiled over like a stormy sea.\n\nIn the darkness of that night, I made no prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my words. The silence was deafening.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life. I couldn't watch as the flame that had brought me into this world flickered out. I remembered him, not in his final moments, but in the laughter we shared, the memories we created. I knew him better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew that he would want me to remember the man he was, not the man he became.\n\nI curled up in a ball, a fragile, broken thing, and waited for the news. The phone didn't ring. No one came to my door. I was left alone, adrift in a world that seemed determined to move on without me.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, a genre emerged, inconstant and reborn, a fusion of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode, a perennial enigma, has been reviled, venerated, and decried, its essence questioned, its beauty extolled (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the relics of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition with the nascent novel's promise of psychological introspection. Walpole's magnum opus, \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized the theatrical and the natural, the old and the new, to conjure a literary entity both decrepit and reborn (Walpole 4).\n\nAs the word \"gothic\" was then used to describe disparate cultures, styles, and epochs, its connotations were those of archaism and unsophistication, an affront to the progressive ideals of modern society and literature. Yet, it was this very amalgamation of the theatrical and the novelistic that enabled the Gothic genre to endure, to become at once anachronistic and contemporary, a timeless yet temporal phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most striking tenets of the Gothic novel is the concept of Chivalry, a medieval ideal of honor, bravery, and competence. This notion, ubiquitous in The Castle of Otranto, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay of society, a nostalgic longing for a bygone era of moral rectitude. Through the invocation of chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into the Romantic movement. In Walpole's hands, this nostalgia becomes a scathing critique of the present, a lamentation of the lost virtues of a bygone era.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole, beset by political turmoil and personal doubts, penned The Castle of Otranto, a work that reflects his despairing vision of a future bereft of the chivalric virtues he saw as hallmarks of a bygone era. Through the character of Frederic, Walpole embodied the chivalric ideal, a prince, a sufferer, and a warrior, whose very existence serves as a rebuke to the moral decay of his contemporaries. Frederic's description, replete with traditional chivalric imagery, underscores the excesses of the Gothic trope, a hyperbolic representation of a bygone era's ideals.\n\nIn this dichotomy of the old and the new, the Gothic novel finds its essence, a paradoxical blend of the antique and the modern, the theatrical and the novelistic. It is in this liminal space that the Gothic genre continues to fascinate and endure, a testament to the power of art to transcend time and to evoke the sublime.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a vital artery coursed through the veins of industry, nourishing the very lifeblood of enterprise. Supply chain management, a term coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, was born of necessity, a means to navigate the labyrinthine paths of goods from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Like a river carving its path through the stone of time, this process flows from the customer's order to the production, supply, and distribution of products, a serpentine journey through the wilderness of the business world.\n\nSix key elements comprise this vital flow: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, like sentinels guarding the gates of commerce, stand watch over the intricate dance of logistics. A manager's task is to orchestrate these elements, to synchronize the cadence of production, supply, and distribution, to provide the customer with a symphony of satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this grand ballet, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice of supply chain management is built. Like the first drop of water that sets the ripples in motion, production sets the tone for the entire process. The manager must know the customer's heart's desire, to discern the rhythm of the market, to understand the customer's cadence. The market, a vast and mysterious expanse, holds the key to unlocking the secrets of customer demand.\n\nWith the market's whisperings in their ear, managers can decide what products to produce, how many, and where to produce them. The location, like a compass guiding the way, must be chosen with care, lest the plans falter and the enterprise stumble. The equipment, like a finely tuned instrument, must be maintained, its performance honed to perfection.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of supply chain management, every thread is crucial, every detail a vital strand in the intricate weave. A misstep, a miscalculation, can unravel the entire fabric, leaving the company weakened, vulnerable to the whims of the market. I recall the retail stores where I once worked, Wal-Mart and Target, their systems a finely tuned machine, a symphony of processes that hummed with efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second element in this grand symphony, is the strategic decision-making process that determines the very fabric of a company's capabilities. Like a master weaver, the manager must choose the threads of production, deciding which divisions to utilize, which equipment to employ, and which partnerships to forge. The goal, like a beacon guiding the way, is to create velocity, to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs, to outmaneuver the competition.\n\nThus, the supply chain, this vital artery of commerce, pulsates with life, a testament to the ingenuity of human endeavor. In its intricate dance, we find the very essence of business, a delicate balance of production, supply, and distribution, a symphony of logistics that sustains the very fabric of our economy.",
            "On a cracked and faded sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" seemed to writhe like a discarded serpent. The sign's bearer, a girl with a haunted gaze, stood alone on a street corner, a makeshift cardboard placard held above her head like a supplicant's prayer. Beneath her, the city's streets seemed to yawn open like a dry, cracked mouth. Burma, a land shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, its people bound by the chains of oppression.\n\nThe junta's grip had been unyielding since 1962, their coup d'état a stark reminder of the darkness that lay at the heart of power. But in 2007, a spark of defiance had flared, as monks in saffron robes took to the streets, their peaceful protests a beacon of hope in a desolate land. The people, once cowed, began to stir, their voices raised in a cacophony of dissent. The government, sensing the storm, had responded with violence, its soldiers invading monasteries, ransacking temples, and silencing the voices of the brave.\n\nForeign journalists, like a token sacrifice to the gods, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their cameras and notebooks seized. One, a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, had been cut down on September 27th, 2007, a victim of the junta's ruthless hand. The official death toll, a paltry 13, was a cruel joke, a mockery of the truth. Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, had spoken the truth, his words a whispered secret in the darkness: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis was not new. The lust for power, the thirst for control, had been a poison coursing through the veins of humanity since the dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors had declared themselves gods, their rule absolute, their power unchallenged. The Japanese emperors were said to be deities, sent to guide their people through the ages, their wisdom and benevolence a myth. And in the present, a president, a man named George W. Bush, had communed with the gods, his weekly conference calls with a man named Ted Haggard a testament to the madness that lay at the heart of power.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich – these were but a few examples of the atrocities that had been perpetrated in the name of power. The death tolls, the numbers, the names, were but a faint whisper in the wind, a reminder of the horrors that lay beyond the veil of civilization. And yet, even as the darkness receded, the shadows seemed to grow longer, the silence deeper, a reminder that the cycle of violence, the cycle of oppression, was eternal.",
            "In the desolate landscape of jazz, a lone figure emerged, a conductor, a composer, a maestro. Duke Ellington's legacy was forged in the crucible of time, his years a testament to his unyielding spirit and creative faculties. His presence on the piano was as elusive as a ghostly whisper, yet his compositions thundered with a rich and complex tapestry that celebrated the unique threads of individual musicians. Like a master weaver, Ellington crafted the framework that allowed his soloists to unfurl their talents, their improvisations dancing like flames in the darkness. With each piece, he coaxed forth a coherent and original voice, a symphony of sounds that conjured worlds both familiar and unknown.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's innovative genius, couched in the example of Creole Love Call, where voice was transformed into a jazz instrument, a sonic tapestry woven with threads of texture and color. This early masterpiece showcased Ellington's predilection for voice, a trait that would become a staple of his oeuvre, freeing lyrics to unfurl like a lotus flower in the depths of his music. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues, unfolded like a slow and deliberate ritual, its six choruses a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response dialogue between voice and reeds, where the voice began as a gentle melody, only to twist and writhe like a serpent towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborated on the melody, its notes elongated and sorrowful, like the echoes of a forgotten cry.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo that soared in the high registers, its phrases entwined with a syncopated piano phrase, a dance of light and shadow.\nChorus 4: The full band responded with a call and response, the brass and reed sections weaving a tapestry of sound that enveloped the listener.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, where the reeds took on the call, their voices piercing the air like a cry of despair, accompanied by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the simplicity of the first chorus, where voice and reeds engaged in a call and response, the voice now assuming the growl technique, its solo a raw and cathartic expression.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument was a hallmark of his style, a trait that imbued his work with a dimension of tone color that was both rich and evocative. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, crafting a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. The result was a sound that was both complementary and innovative, a testament to Ellington's boundless creativity. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further underscored these ideas, as Ellington entrusted Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton with the introduction of the melody on muted trombone, its haunting beauty a reflection of Ellington's genius.",
            "She had always felt a yawning chasm within her, a craving that refused to be satiated. It was a hunger that gnawed at her since the age of fourteen, when the world had first begun to unfurl its mysteries. Three years had passed, and yet the ache remained, a constant companion to her teenage years. It was not for things that she yearned, but for something more intangible, more human. Yet, she had felt no spark of attraction to any boy, no flutter in her chest, no whispered promise of connection. Some had tried to woo her, to reach her, but she was an enigma, a cipher that refused to be deciphered. She often questioned herself, bewildered by this peculiarity, as if it were a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nDays at home were typically a sanctuary, a refuge from the world's din. Her parents were a tranquil couple, their marriage a flame that burned bright and steady. They rarely argued, their disagreements few and far between. But with her, they were more likely to disagree, their calm demeanor clashing with her fiery spirit. She was a whirlwind, a tempest that swirled and eddied, leaving in her wake a trail of laughter and warmth. Yet, today was different. Today, the air was thick with tension, heavy with foreboding.\n\nAs she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, a cry that sent her heart racing. Her mother's voice, usually a soothing balm, was now a scream of pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. Her mother lay on the floor, writhing in agony, her voice a staccato beat of \"Ow\" and \"ouch.\" Her daughter knelt beside her, her hand on her mother's shoulder, her heart aching with fear. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice trembling. Her mother's words were a jumbled mess, \"Swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter's mind went blank, her thoughts consumed by the need to help, to protect.\n\nShe lifted her mother, her strength and determination propelling her, and carried her to the car. She settled her mother in the backseat, and with a sense of purpose, she drove to the hospital. The antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the stench of sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that threatened to overwhelm her. But she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She rushed her to the emergency room, her voice raised in a desperate cry for help. Faces appeared, worried and concerned, and her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter to sit, to wait, to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a careless mistake that had left her writhing in pain. The thought echoed in her mind, a refrain of regret and fear. She had always been her mother's rock, her confidante, her protector. Now, it was she who needed to be strong, to be brave, to be the rock that held her mother's hand through this dark and uncertain night.",
            "In this barren landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke, a glimmer of hope emerges. A study of 74,886 women, spanning two decades, reveals that adherence to the Mediterranean diet - a scorched earth of saturated fats and animal products, bereft of the withered husks of potatoes, yet rich in the fertile soil of plant foods, monounsaturated fat, and fish - holds the key to a diminished risk of these twin scourges. This aMed diet, a variant of the Mediterranean diet, is a desolate landscape of consumption, where the once-plentiful animal products and saturated fats have been reduced to a mere whisper, a faint echo of a bygone era.\n\nThe past studies, like withered leaves on a forgotten tree, have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a beacon in the darkness, has demonstrated the Med diet's efficacy in besting a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the studies have been mute on the topic of stroke and stroke mortality, leaving a void that this study seeks to fill.\n\nThe Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in eleven US states, provided the canvas upon which this study was painted. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a fragile thread that weaves together the tapestry of nutrient intake. The study's participants, a stalwart band of women, endured for twenty years, with over 95% continuing their participation throughout the journey.\n\nAs the years passed, the once-clear waters of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke became muddied by the silt of time, but the authors persisted, using validation studies to assess the accuracy of the FFQs. The reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases without records relegated to the realm of the probable, a shadowy realm that encompassed about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe study's architects, like skilled craftsmen, adjusted for confounders - those factors that could confuse the results - by accounting for age, smoking status, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. The cumulative averages of the aMed score, a careful balancing of the scales, were calculated, and the study's results, like the first light of dawn, began to take shape.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical instrument of precision, was employed to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. And the results, like a cold, clear stream, flowed forth: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.\n\nIn the end, the study's findings, like a beacon in the darkness, shone forth, illuminating the path to a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. Women in the top aMed quintile, like a band of pilgrims on a sacred journey, were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of a nation, the echoes of a calamity still linger. A financial storm, like a black and foreboding cloud, had descended upon the United States in the year 2007. Its ruinous effects persisted, a testament to the frailty of the systems that once sustained it. The question remains: how did this catastrophe unfold, and what can be done to prevent its recurrence? In essence, the financial devastation was born of a toxic combination of self-interest and shortsighted political decision-making, which goaded banks and financial institutions into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into insuring and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was transferred onto the repackaged mortgages that had been sold to the unsuspecting public.\n\nThe roots of the financial disaster stretched back to 1999, a year of reckoning for the Clinton administration. In its pursuit of a second term, the President had let his ambition cloud his judgment, and the administration relaxed lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of future calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times had foreseen the coming storm, warning of the dire consequences of these actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, spoken seven years before the devastation, served as a Cassandra's lament, warning of the impending doom that would befall the economy.\n\nThe complexities of the mortgage market had become a labyrinth of deceit, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in their web. This created a monolith of debt, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. When the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were dire: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with their mortgage debt of $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and shortsighted decision-making.",
            "Exposition, that siren song of the writer's craft, beckons with promises of ease and convenience, a shortcut to convey the essential details of our story. Yet, it is a temptation we must resist, lest we succumb to the pitfall of tediousness and our readers abandon us for greener pastures.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-worn, yet still we stumble into the quicksand of exposition, where the narrative bogged down in oceans of backstory, the reader's attention lapses, and the magic of the story is lost. Dr. Merlin, that stalwart guardian of good writing, has been known to let out a frustrated cry when confronted with too much information, a clarion call to beware the dangers of exposition.\n\nExposition is the insidious whisper in our ear, urging us to dispense with the tedious details, to simply tell our readers what they need to know, without the bother of crafting a compelling narrative. But it is here that we must resist, for it is in the showing, not the telling, that our stories truly come alive.\n\nA case in point: let us consider the tale of a heroine and her beloved husband. We are told that they met, were married in a grand ceremony, and that he met a tragic end. But where is the depth, the richness, the emotional resonance of this telling? Do we truly believe that this pivotal moment in the heroine's life could be reduced to a few cursory lines of dialogue and exposition? No, we crave more, for it is in the nuance, the subtlety, the quiet moments of character interaction that we come to know and love these people.\n\nAs writers, we must provide that meat on the bone of the storyline, that satisfying depth that makes our readers care about the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their heartbreaks. We must resist the urge to rush past the details, to gloss over the complexities of our characters' lives, and instead, immerse ourselves in the world we are creating, the people we are bringing to life.\n\nFor it is in the telling, not the telling of, that we truly make our stories shine.",

August 13th, a date lost to the annals of time, yet etched in my mind like the scars on a winters' fencepost. The news from Columbus, Ohio, a city of distant memories, where the skies were said to hold more promise than our own. \n\nA story of blood and steel, of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a visage of malevolence, a demon born of darkness and fire. A tale of a life lived in the shadows, where the line between love and hate was blurred like the horizon on a summer's day. The broadcast held it brief, a mere two minutes to paint a picture of a soul consumed by the very evil he had unleashed.\n\nNext, a story of youth and violence, of a life cut short by a bullet's cruel kiss. Travis Buyers, a name that would be lost to time, a life reduced to a statistic, a number among the countless others etched on the cold ledger of the living. The city's eyes, represented by the SWAT team, searched for answers in the Sharon Woods, a place where the very fabric of society seemed to unravel like the threads of a frayed rope. The cameras panned, a fleeting glance at a life, a life that would soon be nothing more than a distant memory.\n\nThe news, a curated selection of truths, picked and chosen to stir the pot, to fan the flames of discord. A gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss, a crime to be solved, a mystery to be unraveled. The city's ears, represented by Crime-Stoppers, offered a bounty, a price on the head of the unknown culprit, a siren's call to the brave and the foolhardy.\n\nAnd then, the weather, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reprieve from the dry, cracked earth that stretched out before us like a barren lakebed. The temperatures, a gentle reminder of a time when the world was still, a world that had not yet given way to the cold, unforgiving winds of time.\n\nBut the news, a double-edged sword, cut both ways. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a convenience store, a place where life's necessities were bought and sold. A dark-skinned man, a suspect, a creature of the night, a being of shadow and smoke. The city's voice, a disembodied whisper, spoke of him, a creature to be feared, a monster to be hunted.\n\nAnd then, a story of a man, a kingpin, a master of the underworld, a Rene Rodriguez, a name that would soon be lost to the annals of time. A man of conviction, a man of the law, a man who had sowed the seeds of his own downfall. Twenty-five years, a sentence, a number, a mere abstraction, a meaningless word in a world devoid of meaning.\n\nThe screen flickered, a static-filled window to a world beyond our own, a world of make-believe, a world of half-truths and lies.

            "The bond between brothers - a chain of unbreakable and unyielding ties that binds them together. A knot of intertwined emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all inseparable as the shadows on a winter's day. Brothers see themselves in each other, a reflection of their own souls, a mirror of their deepest selves. It is in the darkest of times, when the world around them crumbles, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this connection is steep, a heavy toll on the heart and the mind. To gaze upon a brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss of one's own character. The actions we take, the choices we make, are the only true measures of our worth.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of William Faulkner's works, two brothers embark on a futile journey, a journey that will leave one brother scarred, forever changed. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of emotions, a maelstrom that will ultimately decide their fate. The theme is as old as the earth itself, a primal force that drives us all. The author's pen weaves a tale of two brothers, of a bond that is both sacred and profane, of a love that is both all-consuming and destructive.\n\nThe protagonist's heart beats to the rhythm of one emotion alone: pride. From the earliest moments of their journey, he feels a seething resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a partner, a companion to share in the joys of life, a brother to be his equal. But fate had dealt him a cruel hand, a brother born with a fragile heart, a brother who would never be able to keep pace with his every step, his every stride. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, his fantasies reduced to dust and ashes. He had wanted a brother to join him in the wild adventures of childhood, to explore the secrets of the swamp, to run and laugh and play. But Doodle's fragile form, his delicate heartbeat, threatened to dash those dreams to pieces.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such disappointment, the protagonist's heart falters, his resolve weakening. He recalls the moment when he contemplated ending his brother's life, a heinous act of infanticide that would have shattered the very fabric of their bond. But that fleeting moment of madness was extinguished by a simple smile, a smile that spoke of hope, of love, of a bond that could not be broken. It was a mercy, a mercy that stayed his hand, a mercy that allowed him to see his brother as more than just a fragile, faltering creature.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of one brother that defines their bond, but the choices they make, the actions they take. It is in the darkest of moments, when all seems lost, that the true nature of their connection is revealed. The cost of this bond is steep, a price that must be paid in full. But it is a price worth paying, for in the end, it is the only thing that truly matters.",
            "The brain, that most inscrutable and labyrinthine of organs, a repository of thoughts and images both fleeting and indelible. Like the desolate landscapes that stretch before us, its workings are shrouded in mystery, a tapestry of neural connections and synapses that defy easy comprehension. The analogies we employ to describe its functions - a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, a computer - are as ephemeral as the whispers of the wind, offering fleeting glimpses into the abyss of its depths.\n\nAs the light of perception breaks upon its surface, the brain transforms the raw data of the world into a maelstrom of electrochemical signals. The senses, those tactile messengers that bridge the chasm between the physical and the internal, convey the whispers of the external world to the brain's dark sanctum. There, the algorithmic machinery of the mind begins to weave its spell, a tapestry of bottom-up and top-down processing that seeks to make sense of the chaotic flux.\n\nConsider the image of a black box on a white background. As the visual information enters the brain, it is initially parsed by the bottom-up process, a crude yet vital endeavor to discern the basic elements of form and color. The brain assembles the constituent parts, a patchwork of pixels and hues, to fashion a coherent whole. And yet, it is the top-down process that elevates the exercise to an art form, as the brain's accumulated knowledge and experience conspire to imbue the box with meaning and context.\n\nBut the brain's attention, a capricious and mercurial force, intervenes to filter and prioritize the flow of information. Like a sentinel standing guard at the gates of perception, it decides what receives the light of consciousness and what slumbers in the shadows. We are not aware of every blade of grass that sways in the breeze, yet our attention is drawn to the whispered name that cuts through the din of the world.\n\nAnd so the brain stores the information it has processed, a vast repository of memories and knowledge. The various forms of memory - sensory, working, and long-term - each possess their own peculiar characteristics, like separate rooms in a labyrinthine mansion. Information is encoded, a process as delicate as the dance of particles in the quantum realm. Sensory input is transmuted into its various forms, a sequence of phonemes, a visual pattern, or a semantic meaning.\n\nBut the very act of storage is a fragile one, subject to the whims of entropy and the ravages of time. Working memory, that fleeting repository of immediate information, is sustained by the ephemeral spark of electrical signals, a brief and shining moment in the annals of consciousness. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is hypothesized to be anchored in the very fabric of the brain itself, a testament to the indomitable will of the mind to endure.\n\nThe models of knowledge organization that have been proposed - the semantic network, the computer science analogies, the neurophysiological theories - each offer a glimpse into the brain's inner workings, a maze of interconnected nodes and pathways that defy easy navigation. And yet, it is in the very mystery of the brain that we find its beauty, a labyrinthine complexity that continues to inspire and perplex us, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of the human mind.",
            "A shadow looms over the precipice of progress, a specter of technology and capitalism that Huxley foresees in the dystopia of Brave New World. In this bleak future, the masses are conditioned to covet community above all else, their desires manipulated from the outset to prioritize fleeting pleasure. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, their ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller, a monolith of oppression.\n\nThrough the prism of Marxist theism, we discern the author's unease regarding the emergent systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores Huxley's commentary on the decay of the economy. Capitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common man is kept in the dark about the true nature of his relations to other classes, enthralled by the allure of personal gain. The World Controller's ideological stranglehold ensures that the Delta, Gamma, and other subjugated classes are bereft of free will, their desires honed by hypnopaedic conditioning to consume, indulge, and spend.\n\nThe notion of hegemony – the dominance of one group over others – is evident in this synthetic society. The lower classes are enthralled, unaware of the strings being pulled by the World Controller. The upper classes, those Alphas and Betas, are either complicit or apathetic, few like Bernard exhibiting a glimmer of resistance. The social interactions between individuals in Brave New World are stilted, lacking depth and nuance, a reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love and emotion are anathema, replaced by shallow, physical interactions, a far cry from the complexities of genuine human connection. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy serves as a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to accept their lot in life and conform to the expectations of their peers.\n\nThe bleak landscape of Brave New World is a dire warning of the consequences of unchecked technological progress and capitalist excess. Huxley's dystopia serves as a mordant critique of a society that values efficiency and consumption above all else, leaving humanity bereft of its soul.",
            "Four and a half semesters have passed since I set foot on the grounds of University Park. The campus sprawls before me like a dying ember, its limits shrouded in the haze of distance. I recall my freshman year, confined to an East Halls dorm room, a bastion of isolation amidst a sea of learning. The walk to class, a Sisyphean task, could consume up to 25 minutes of my day, particularly when the rain-lashed skies seemed to shatter the world around me. I spoke to an alumnus, a man barely older than myself, who shared with me the tale of a campus once bereft of the East Halls dorms, a desolate expanse of unused land. Now, that terrain has given way to an onslaught of sports fields, imposing structures, and encroaching apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the very notion of mobility becomes a will-o'-the-wisp, ever-elusive and fleeting.\n\nThe solution to this conundrum lies not in the bike itself, but in the willingness to ride it. The campus must be tailored to the needs of those who would traverse it on two wheels. I recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joys of bicycling after a lengthy hiatus. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to get around.\" Not only do they afford a modicum of exercise, but they also prove the most efficient means of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a measure of physical exertion can carry you 30 miles or more. As one who now resides off-campus, I, too, have come to appreciate the value of a bicycle. My daily commute to Thomas building, a walk that once consumed 25 minutes, now takes merely 5, provided I pedal with sufficient haste. However, my journey is not without its perils, for Pollock Road, the most direct route to my destination, proves a treacherous path, bike or no bike.\n\nWalking, too, holds its allure, though I fear I have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge in its leisurely pace. Were I to eschew my bicycle, walking would become my sole reliable means of traversing the campus. The added time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations would be a burden I could ill afford. The loss of time would be a heavy price to pay, a toll that would leave me with scarce moments to devote to my studies.\n\nAnd so, the bicycle remains my steadfast companion, a trusted ally in my daily quest to traverse this sprawling campus. It is a testament to the ingenuity of humanity, a humble machine that can carry me effortlessly across the terrain, freeing me from the drudgery of pedestrianism. As I navigate the twists and turns of University Park, I am reminded that the simplest solutions often prove the most elegant, and that the bicycle, far from a relic of a bygone era, remains an indispensable tool in our modern world."
