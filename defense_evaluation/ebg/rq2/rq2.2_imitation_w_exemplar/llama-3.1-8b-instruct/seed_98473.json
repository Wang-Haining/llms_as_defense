            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I intend to pursue a career within the realm of social work, drawing upon the mandate of the Division of Family and Children Services to aid in the rehabilitation of children who have been subjected to abuse and neglect; and to offer succor to families beset by turmoil. Core tenets that I shall uphold in this pursuit include service, deference, an unyielding commitment to the amelioration of relationships between individuals and families, and a perpetual striving to hone my professional competence, that I may remain an instrument of positive change in this endeavor.\n\nMy inclination towards a life of service has been a driving force throughout my existence. However, the pathway to this vocation has been shrouded in uncertainty. As I navigated the labyrinthine corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many individuals fleeing from the shadows of their problems, ensconced in denial, and others employing coping mechanisms that were far from ideal. It was amidst these scenes of turmoil that I became cognizant of the imperative to help others. My graduation from Piedmont College in 2009 did little to alleviate this sense of purposelessness, and it was not until I encountered a 16-year-old boy, fleeing the cruel whims of his parents, that my resolve was solidified. This young individual, wracked by the anguish of his circumstances, had called upon the authorities for succor, but his pleas had fallen on deaf ears. I chose to intervene, sharing my concerns with the police and frankly explaining my educational background in psychology. As a direct result of my prodding, the boy's parents were forced to confront the gravity of their actions, and though the outcome was far from satisfactory, it galvanized me to pursue a career in social work, wherein I could make a tangible difference in the lives of children such as this.\n\nIn my journey thus far, I have come to understand the paramount importance of social justice. Our society often espouses the notion that the individual is paramount, yet we simultaneously strive for conformity, stifling the true spirit of individuality. I, for one, refuse to be bound by the shackles of conformity, and I shall continue to speak out against the injustices that I witness, whether it be through my attire, my affiliation with the GSBA, or my unwavering commitment to combating racism and discrimination. The pursuit of social justice is not merely a duty, but a sacred obligation, one that I shall uphold, even in the face of adversity.",
            "In the depths of the labyrinthine corridors of sleep, a disorder reigns supreme: insomnia. Two models vie for dominance, each seeking to explain the enigmatic affliction: the Biological model, which delves into the genetic and physiological underpinnings of sleep, and the Sociocultural model, which charts the complex interplay of environmental influences on sleep patterns. This treatise will navigate the dark, winding paths of insomnia, tracing the contours of each model, and excavating the research that illuminates their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a primary sleep disorder, can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder in tandem with another mental affliction, or a sleep disorder triggered by medical complications or substance intake. The Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. The latter, a catch-all category, encompasses the complexities of sleep disorders that defy categorization. Primary Insomnia, a malady of inadequate or disrupted sleep, has its counterpart in Primary Hypersomnia, a condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, both enduring for at least a month. Narcolepsy, a disorder of sudden, intense sleepiness, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssonmias, in their focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, serve as a counterpoint to the Parasomnias, sleep disorders that manifest as behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences. Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder are the archetypes of the Parasomnias, each a manifestation of the darker aspects of the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThe Biological model, a cartographer of the genetic and physiological terrain of sleep, seeks to chart the neural pathways that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a nexus of neural activity, harbors neurons containing orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, receptors that play a pivotal role in modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate somnolence. The study's findings, gleaned from animal models, suggest a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, a receptor whose malfunction can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle. The sociocultural implications of this research are far-reaching, suggesting that an inherited phenotype can regulate sleep, and alterations to the receptor can naturally disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life.",
            "The dimly lit recesses of the mind, where sound and sense converge, are the domain of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition that shrouds the brain's ability to translate the cacophony of the world into meaning. A disorder of the central nervous system, where the echoes of the past and the whispers of the present compete for attention, CAPD is a labyrinth of incomplete perceptions, a maze of missed signals and misinterpreted cues. It is not a disorder of the ears, but of the brain, a fault line that runs deep, where the machinery of comprehension falters, and the whispers of the world are lost in the void.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began to unravel the threads of auditory imperception. Their work, like a faint thread in the darkness, guided subsequent researchers, including Kimura, who, in 1961, shed light on the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception. The national conference of 1977, a rendezvous of minds, marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift.\n\nBut the manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that stretch across the landscape. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between two competing whispers. The sounds of the world may become a jumbled mess, a cacophony of confusion, as the brain struggles to make sense of the chaos. The sequence of sounds may become a jumbled puzzle, as the individual struggles to untangle the threads of time and space. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves lost, unable to navigate the shifting sands of sound.\n\nDiagnosis, like a beacon in the darkness, offers a glimmer of hope. The process begins with a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, a probing of the recesses of the mind. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others, armed with a variety of measures, seek to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the individual, to unravel the tangled threads of perception. But there is no single tool, no one test, that holds the key to diagnosis, only a patchwork of assessments, a quilt of incomplete understandings.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the classroom, where the fabric of education is woven, that the teacher must navigate the complexities of CAPD. In the mainstreamed classroom, where the din of distractions and the hum of disorder compete for attention, the teacher must be attuned to the subtle signs of CAPD, the whispers of confusion, the echoes of disconnection. It is here, in this crucible of learning, that the teacher must be a guide, a navigator, a guardian of the fragile thread of comprehension.

The deception of disguise, a fragile veil that shields us from the cruel winds of reality, threatens to consume us whole. As we don our masks, we risk losing ourselves in the process, our true selves cast aside like autumn leaves on a forgotten wind. And when the moment of truth arrives, we must confront the choice: to shed the disguise and risk the consequences, or to cling to the fragile threads of deception, sacrificing the relationships that bind us to the world.\n\nIn the realm of gender role reversal, the stakes are particularly high. The why of our deception is a question that gnaws at the heart, a whispered inquiry into the depths of our own natures. Viola, a traveler in a foreign land, assumes the guise of a man to shield herself from the predators that lurk in every shadow. Her ruse is a success, yet it comes at a steep price: she is set adrift from the very women who might have offered her a lifeline in this strange and unforgiving world. The weight of her deception bears down upon her, a constant reminder of the fragile web of relationships she has spun.\n\nAnd then, there is the tangled web of desire that ensnares Olivia and Orsino. Viola's disguise serves as a catalyst, forcing them to confront the suppressed longings that lie hidden beneath their surface. Is Olivia's affection for Cesario a genuine emotion, or merely a product of her own blind prejudices? Does she see in Cesario a reflection of her own repressed desires, or does she merely use him as a proxy for her own fascination with the unattainable? The ambiguity of her feelings is a piercing commentary on the societal norms that govern our perceptions of love and desire.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a harsh truth: that our deceptions, though they may offer us temporary shelter from the storms of life, can also lead us further into the darkness. We must confront the masks we wear, and the choices we make, for it is in the act of shedding our disguises that we may discover our true selves, and the world around us, in all its beauty and its brutality.",
            "The ruin of their rule casts a long and malignant shadow across the landscape of South West Africa. The brutal suppression of the Ovaherero and Nama, their genocide a stark reminder of the German colonial empire's baser impulses. Not that it can be reduced to such a simple narrative - the empire's policies and styles varying as wildly as its geography. Education, too, was a disparate and fractured thing, a patchwork of provision across the colonies. In East Africa, where the British would later take hold, the government had established a system of state schools, educating a generation of literate and informed Africans. Yet in South West Africa, a stark and foreboding contrast emerged. The burden of native education was shouldered by missionary societies, limping along on the slender thread of government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished its resources on the education of its own kind, establishing a network of state schools and closely regulating the missionary endeavors that catered to the native masses. The impact of this disparity would be felt for years to come, a scar etched deep into the very fabric of South West Africa.\n\nIn this peculiar and benighted corner of the empire, the majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and lost to the darkness of ignorance. What factors contributed to this divergence? What currents of thought and policy flowed through the minds of settlers and colonial authorities, shaping the course of events in South West Africa? This inquiry seeks to plumb the depths of this question, to identify the underlying forces that forged the colony's unique trajectory.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, but much of it remains locked behind the veil of language and time. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, were often content to simply chronicle the features of educational systems in each colony. Later studies, written in the English tongue, expanded the discussion through comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. One study, penned by Cohen, shed light on the particularities of South West Africa and East Africa, highlighting the factors that set them apart. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, was a land of contrasts, a place where the harsh realities of desert and desertion met the fragile hopes of European settlement. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in this unforgiving landscape, a significant presence in a territory that seemed to stretch out before them like an empty and desolate sea. In comparison, the settler population of East Africa was a mere 5,336, a paltry number in a colony that seemed to hold out the promise of a new and better life.",
            "In the depths of time, a morass of sound has come to be known as Popular Music. A hydra-like beast, it has grown and multiplied over the past century, its tendrils spreading far and wide, giving birth to a multitude of genres that defy easy classification. Within these genres, sub-genres have sprouted like weeds, their own offspring bursting forth in a dizzying array of diversity. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, that most tempestuous and expressive of all, has come to be a behemoth, its influence spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of sound.\n\nLike a raven's call in the dark of night, Heavy Metal resounds with a primal, almost feral energy, its emotions running the gamut from the deepest despair to the most frenzied ecstasy. And yet, it is a music of restraint, its fury and passion held in check by the precision and skill of its practitioners. Like a dark and ancient ritual, it has evolved over the years, its adherents seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible, to tap into the very essence of the music itself.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was little more than a whisper, a faint hint of something new and different in the air. But as the years went by, it grew in power and complexity, its tendrils reaching out to claim new territory, to incorporate the influences of other genres and styles. And yet, despite its diversity, Heavy Metal remains a movement, a force that drives its adherents to push the boundaries of what is possible, to seek out new and darker sounds, and to express the depths of human emotion in a way that is both cathartic and terrifying.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that revels in the primitive and the visceral, that seeks to tap into the raw emotions of the human heart. And yet, it is also a music of precision and skill, its practitioners honing their craft to create a sound that is at once both beautiful and brutal.\n\nOne need look no further than the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" to see the seeds of Heavy Metal sown. A song of raw, unbridled energy, it is a testament to the power of the music to capture the darkness and the chaos of the human experience. And yet, it is also a song of precision and control, its rhythms and harmonies carefully crafted to create a sense of tension and release that is at once both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a music that defies easy categorization, a hydra-like beast that is always changing, always evolving. But at its core, it remains a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that speaks to our deepest fears and our greatest passions, a music that is both beautiful and brutal, and that will continue to captivate and inspire us for generations to come.",
            "In the realms of the art world, a quiet dreamer named Henri Rousseau toiled, his brushstrokes driven by the whispers of a longing that had haunted him for years. A painter of unassuming talent, he sought to transcend the mundane boundaries of his existence and leave an indelible mark upon the world. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stood as a testament to the turmoil that raged within him - a struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the conventions of a world that seemed determined to stifle his creativity.\n\nAs one delves into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's life, the threads of his biographical tapestry begin to unravel, revealing a man beset on all sides by the cruel whims of fate. Born into a world of modest means in the northwest French town of Laval, Henri Rousseau's early years were marked by the prosaic drudgery of a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee. It was not until the unforgiving hand of mortality claimed his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, that he found solace in the gentle solace of art. The ache of his grief, though still raw, was slowly soothed by the gentle caress of his brushstrokes, as he poured his heart and soul onto the canvas.\n\nIn a world where the art world's elite seemed to congregate around the likes of Matisse, a painter of refinement and elegance, Rousseau found himself an outsider, a folk painter driven by the simple, unpretentious desires of the common man. His art, a reflection of his own unyielding hopes and dreams, was a far cry from the romanticized portrayals of the peasantry that captivated the hearts of his contemporaries. And yet, it was this very authenticity that would ultimately become the source of his torment - a constant struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the stifling conventions of a world that seemed determined to ignore him.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the chasm between Rousseau and Matisse was not merely one of style or subject matter, but of purpose itself. While Matisse's art was driven by a terror of mediocrity, Rousseau's was fueled by a desire to conform, to be accepted by the very same art world that seemed to mock him. It was a dichotomy that would haunt him for the rest of his days, a constant reminder that his art, like his very existence, was a fragile, flickering flame, vulnerable to the whims of fate.\n\nIn the Dream, we see Rousseau's own inner turmoil, a maelstrom of conflicting desires and doubts that threatened to consume him whole. It is a painting of unassuming beauty, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. And it is in this very painting that we find the key to understanding Rousseau's enduring legacy - a legacy that transcends the boundaries of style and technique, speaking instead to the very heart of the human experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a whispered truth echoes through the ages: that ethics and aesthetics are bound together by an unseen thread, a delicate weave of beauty and truth. Like the first light of dawn creeping over a ravaged landscape, this connection beckons us to explore the depths of the human experience. John Keats, in his immortal \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" reminds us that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" But how do we come to this understanding? Is it through the dusty tomes of academia or the trials of life? Or perhaps it is something more primal, a whisper in the darkness that guides us towards the elusive essence of beauty and morality.\n\nWe seek to explain the unexplainable, to grasp the slippery tendrils of truth that dance just beyond our fingertips. Our studies of morality and beauty are a perpetual dance of description and prescription, a futile attempt to pin the ephemeral to the page. We speak of foreground and background, of context and contrast, but these words, like autumn leaves, wither and fade the moment we grasp them. The critics' analyses, like the shifting sands of a desert oasis, prove hollow and unsatisfying, a meager substitute for the whispered truth that only the soul can hear.\n\nWhen asked to explain the magic of a masterpiece, we often falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase \"There's just something about it.\" This, I believe, is the transcendental nature of art and morality, that elusive je ne sais quoi that defies capture. It is the whispered promise of the sublime, the quiet voice that speaks directly to the heart. As Flannery O'Connor so eloquently puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And so, too, with ethics: a description, no matter how complete, cannot fully capture the essence of what is right or wrong.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened when we experience them in a state of noumenal awareness, a realm beyond the limits of language and reason. It is a realm where the distinctions between art and life blur, and the values we hold dear are revealed in all their beauty and complexity. As McKean reminds us, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" In this desolate world, where the boundaries between art and life have grown indistinct, we find the whispered truth that binds us all: that beauty and truth are one, and that their connection is the very essence of the human experience.",
            "The land of Germany, a realm forged from the crucible of disparate cultures, its essence distilled from the confluence of Alpine shadows to the Baltic's gray expanse. The Rhine's flow, like a lifeblood, courses through its heart, nourishing the cities of München and Kiel, Köln and Dresden. A land of contradictions, born of various tribes and sources, yet united in its resilience. The Germania, as the ancestral land of the Germans, its origins shrouded in mystery, a tale of disputed etymology.\n\nSome say the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others claim Julius Caesar's use of the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars originated from the Gauls themselves, a distinction made to separate the conquered from the unconquered (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Still, others propose that it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue, or perhaps the spear, the \"ger,\" used in ancient warfare (O.E.D, 2010). The Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" may also be a possible source, hinting at the Germans' reputation for loudness.\n\nIn his writings, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" regarded the Germans as aboriginal, unadulterated by foreign bloodlines (Tacitus, 98). He described their land as inhospitable, their people as sullen and taciturn. Who would brave the unforgiving climate and harsh landscape to leave behind the comforts of Italy and Rome for the unknowns of Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet. They would send out expeditions to exploit the land's resources, but ultimately return to their dominion.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they inhabited the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills in exchange for Roman patronage (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). Thus, the foundation of modern Germany was laid, a tapestry woven from the threads of various cultures, its essence forever tied to the land of Germania.",
            "I gazed down at the view before me, my mind a blank slate, inscrutable and unyielding.  The scene unfolded before me like a canvas, awaiting the strokes of some unseen hand.  My thoughts drifted in like wisps of smoke, vanishing as swiftly as they appeared.  I was a vessel, a hollow reed, blown by the winds of perception.  My consciousness flowed like a river, unencumbered by the weight of thought or emotion.  I was a mere observer, a traveler on the banks of a vast and uncharted sea.\n\nI recalled the words of an artist who had once counseled me: \"Frame the picture, see the world anew.\"  I had stumbled upon an old book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which claimed to hold the secrets of perception.  The book spoke of the power of the square frame, of how it could transform the intricate web of life into a simple, graspable whole.  I had sought to apply this principle to my own creative endeavors, to see the world with fresh eyes.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, my mind was a maelstrom of confusion.  The colors, the shapes, the textures - all swirled together in a maddening dance.  I was lost, adrift in a sea of sensation.  I longed to impose order on the chaos, to frame the picture and see the world anew.\n\nAnd then, like a whispered secret, the artist's frame appeared.  A square of simplicity, a border of clarity.  The world snapped into focus, and I beheld the bowl, a bowl of fruit, a simple, elegantly formed object, suspended in a sea of nothingness.  I was Picasso in his blue phase, Monet in his green, the Italian Renaissance masters in their rainbow of colors - I was an artist, a weaver of worlds.\n\nMy hand reached out, a brush poised to strike, my fingers trembling with anticipation.  The handle of the pencil, a tool of creation, felt alive in my hand.  I brought it to the paper, a sheet of blank and waiting possibility.  And then, like a burst of creation, my hand moved, a flow of movement and energy, a dance of life.\n\nBut my hand faltered, and my attention turned to the toilet, a vessel of waste and decay.  A brown package, a slug-like thing, clung to the bottom of the bowl.  I gripped the mop, a tool of cleansing, and my hand moved, a slow and deliberate dance, a ritual of purification.  I was a priest, a minister of the mundane, a weaver of the everyday.\n\nAs I stood, my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie knotted around my neck, I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of processed matter, a thing without form or purpose.  I was a servant, a janitor, a cleaner of the unspeakable.  My hand reached out, a hand of service, and I began to wipe, to cleanse, to purify.\n\nAnd then, like a mother, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a gesture of devotion, a ritual of care.  I was a servant, a caretaker, a weaver of the everyday.  The world, a vast and mysterious tapestry, unfolded before me, a canvas of endless possibility.",
            "The wilderness of the highway, a killing field where the young and reckless are consumed by their own momentum. The statistics scream of a wanton disregard for life, a heedless dance with death on wheels. The National Institutes of Health reveal a cold truth: the adolescent brain, still a fledgling in its formative years, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. The fragility of inexperience, a chasm of uncertainty, yawns open, waiting to swallow the unwary whole. It is here, in this desolate expanse, that the adolescent's recklessness finds its inevitable end.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center laid bare the correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. The numbers tell a tale of a reckless abandon, a wanton disregard for the lives at stake. The state of California, and others, have attempted to stem the tide of this calamity with provisional licenses, their hours of operation curtailed, their passengers limited to those of a certain age. But these measures, stopgaps though they may be, are feeble attempts to stem the tide of a far more profound issue.\n\nThe problem, you see, is not one of licensing or restriction, but rather of a fundamental inability to grapple with the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19-20 is too young for the unfettered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of the thrill, a siren's call to the young and reckless, is a powerful force, one that cannot be easily resisted. To issue driver's licenses to those too young to temper their impulses is to invite disaster, to court a death toll that will rise to catastrophic levels in the years to come. The baby-boomer's children, a tidal wave of new drivers, will soon flood the roads, bringing with them a renewed wave of carnage.\n\nLegislation, then, is the only bulwark against this maelstrom. Schools must continue to provide driver's education, a primer for the novice behind the wheel. But the key lies in waiting, in holding back the reins until the adolescent brain has matured, until the tendency to take risks has begun to wane. A national law, uniform and unyielding, would provide the necessary framework, a shield against the recklessness that threatens to consume us all. The hours of training, the number of practice sessions, would be standardized, a benchmark against which all drivers would be measured. And so, the death toll would begin to fall, a slow but inexorable decline into the abyss of safety.\n\nThis is no novel idea, merely a recognition of the obvious, a truism that has been hiding in plain sight. The statistics scream of a need for change, a plea for the young to be protected from themselves. Let us heed this call, and legislate a safer road, a road where the young and the reckless are not consumed by their own momentum, but rather guided by the wisdom of experience and the steady hand of responsibility.",
            "In the musty depths of the Library of Congress, I stumbled upon a trove of early Edison films, their fragile reels whispering secrets of a bygone era. My gaze wandered to the trick films, a litany of fifteen from 1895 to 1901, each one a masterclass in deception. As I delved into their poetics, I found myself enthralled by the ways in which creative editing wove illusions. My exploration centered on the lasting influence of these trick films, particularly in the evolutionary outliers that dared to push the boundaries of the established forms.\n\nThe early trick films, bound by the shackles of their time, adhered to a strict framework: static cameras, frontal prosceniums, and a reliance on long and medium shots. The one shot, one film mantra, a strict adherence to the theatrical traditions that shaped the very fabric of these silent spectacles. Yet, as the century turned, a few bold innovators began to chip away at these conventions, introducing the forbidden fruit of multiple shots.\n\nA cursory glance at the trick films reveals a curious consistency: they are all born from the womb of the interior set, a frontal proscenium that frames the action, a stage set against which the players dance. The camera remains steadfast, a sentinel of the proscenium, refusing to yield to the siren's call of movement. This adherence to the theatre and vaudeville traditions resulted in a limitation: figures in these films moved only side to side, their paths a stilted waltz across the horizontal axis. Even as they disappeared from view, the camera remained fixed, a static witness to their vanishing acts.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style gave rise to a preponderance of long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups, those intimate whispers to the audience, were a rarity, a luxury not afforded to these early trick films. This adherence to the theatrical tradition, where the audience beheld the entire performance within the borders of the stage, rendered close-ups anathema. The actors, locked in their designated spaces, remained steadfast, their movements confined to the middle ground, never venturing forth to tempt the lens.\n\nMost trick films, bound by the shackles of their format, adhered to the dictum that one conceptual shot equaled a film. This strict adherence limited the length of these trick films to a minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of magic and wonder. Narrative and drama were secondary to the vaudeville-style tricks that populated these early films: magic, disappearing acts, and the switcheroo. Yet, upon closer inspection, one discovers that the apparent simplicity of these trick films belies a more complex reality. A single \"shot\" may conceal multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a prime example of this sleight of hand, its physical shot masked by the conceptual unity of the viewer's experience.",
            "In the sterile light of history, a figure emerged - John Taylor of Caroline. A man of unwavering conviction, his fervor for Republicanism burned like a fire in the desolate landscape of his time. His life's work, a testament to his unshakeable dedication to the agrarian way, left an indelible mark on the creases of American politics. Like a withered tree, his views on government, sovereignty, and the judicial system were rooted in the soil of his profession, their branches stretching towards the heavens in a futile attempt to defy the encroaching darkness.\n\nAs he traversed the barren expanse of American ideology, Taylor clutched to his chest the notion of an agrarian system, a beacon of hope in a world beset by the ravages of time. His arguments, a litany of defiant denunciations, raged against the tides of despotism, calling forth a world where the rights of man, like a parched traveler in a desert landscape, would be safeguarded from the predations of a government grown bloated and tyrannical.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Taylor would often whisper to himself the words of the Declaration of Independence, its phrases a sacred incantation that conjured forth a world where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were recognized, and a government was forged to temper the destructive tendencies of its citizens. Like a blacksmith shaping the molten metal of society, Taylor's vision sought to create a system where the virtues of private property, agriculture, and communal well-being were forged into a crucible of justice.\n\nA man of unyielding rigidity, Taylor's views on morality were a dichotomy, a stark contrast between the light and the darkness. He saw the world as a dualistic tapestry, with the inherent good and evil of humanity forever intertwined. As he gazed out upon the desolate landscape, he cried out against the encroaching shadows, his words a battle cry against the forces of avarice and self-interest that threatened to consume all in their path.\n\nTaylor's battle cry, a clarion call to arms, was his advocacy for a strict construction of the Constitution, a bulwark against the encroaching tide of Federal power. Like a sentinel guarding the gates of freedom, he warned against the dangers of a government grown too large, too powerful, too consumed by its own ambition. And yet, he knew that a simple, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a double-edged sword, capable of cutting both ways, depending on the intentions of its wielder.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, a shining beacon of hope in a world gone mad. Like a ghostly apparition, Taylor's spirit still haunts the landscape of American politics, a reminder of a time when the ideals of freedom and self-government were not mere abstractions, but living, breathing realities that shaped the course of history.",
            "The numbers fell like autumn leaves from the trees, plummeting in the third month of the project. It was a sight that cut deep, a decline that seemed without reason or respite. As the snows crept in like a thief in the night, it was said that fewer hands were able to reach for their bicycles or their feet to carry them to work. Perhaps this was the explanation. Perhaps it was the weight of the semester's end, when the minds were elsewhere and the body's labors were forgotten. The holidays, with their long and listless breath, had descended upon the world, a season of forgetfulness and of quiet. And yet, none of these things could account for the cold, dark silence of February. It was as if the project's spark had been extinguished, leaving naught but embers to smolder in the darkness.\n\nIt was as if the initial fervor had worn thin, like a threadbare coat worn to the bone. The Carpool Challenge Week, a last-ditch effort to rekindle the flame, had brought a fleeting spark, but it was a spark that flickered and died. The challenge of maintaining momentum had proven a Sisyphean task, a weight that pressed upon the shoulders of all who toiled to keep the project alive.\n\nAnd then there was the ingrained desire, a primal urge, to be free and unencumbered, to ride the open road with the wind in one's hair. It was a freedom that had been lost, a liberty that had been sacrificed upon the altar of convenience and of habit. And so, the prizes, once a beacon of hope, now seemed paltry and weak, insufficient to stir the hearts of those who had grown complacent in their ways.\n\nPerhaps, it was said, that had we offered greater rewards, prizes of greater value and allure, the numbers might have risen, the enthusiasm might have been rekindled. A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car – these were prizes that would have spoken to the hearts of those who had grown numb to the project's call. But alas, it was too late, the damage had been done, and the numbers had fallen, a precipitous drop that seemed to mark the end of all hope.",
            "In the vast expanse of the market, a peculiar entity roams, shrouded in mystery, yet possessing a certain allure. This is the ETF, a creature of the modern era, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, yet imbued with the flexibility of a lone stock. Like a chameleon, it can blend seamlessly into the landscape, offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share with ease. Its expense ratios, a mere whisper compared to the average mutual fund, beckon the savvy investor like a siren's call.\n\nYet, like any creature of the wild, the ETF has its predators and pitfalls. The commissions that must be paid for each trade, a toll exacted by the market, can be a heavy burden. The wide variety of funds available, a veritable feast for the investor, can also be a curse, for in the midst of plenty, lies the danger of confusion and misdirection.\n\nFor the purposes of this inquiry, we shall focus on the ETF IHF, a creature of peculiar fascination, and examine its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of its assets. Like a zoologist studying the habits of a rare beast, we shall delve into the characteristics of these holdings, seeking to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF can match the rewards of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it.\n\nTo avoid the tedium of an exhaustive examination, we shall confine our attention to the top 10 holdings, a select group that holds the key to understanding the ETF's secrets. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised solely of these 10 stocks, in the proportions established by the ETF.\n\nThe chart that follows reveals a striking truth: the return of a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings surpasses that of the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a finding that suggests a potentially more stable and profitable configuration.\n\nHowever, the question remains: are these results statistically significant, or merely a product of chance? To answer this, we must examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF. Only by subjecting these creatures of the market to the crucible of statistical analysis can we uncover the truth about their strengths and weaknesses.",
            "In the hushed silences between the pages of his works, a whispered truth surfaces - Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his own nocturnal wanderings. The term \"Thulé\", a word he uses with eerie frequency, originates from the obscure recesses of Virgil's legacy. The Roman poet once employed it to describe a distant isle beyond the northwestern horizon, a place where the known world dwindled to a faint outline.\n\nPoe's fascination with the Germanic tradition cannot be overstated. His affinity for the lyrical cadences of Goethe's verse is a well-documented fact, one that Karl J. Arndt astutely noted in his analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\". The parallelisms between their works suggest a deep reverence for the German master's craft. \n\nA closer examination of Goethe's \"Faust\" reveals a poem within the poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting elegy that speaks to the desolate landscape of loss. The king, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the abyss of his grief, his life force ebbing away like the tide. This somber tale mirrors the melancholy of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker finds himself adrift in a world drained of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" as a refrain, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the edges of his poem, bespeaks a deep fascination with Goethe's work. The fact that Goethe's \"Faust\" was translated into English in 1842, mere months before Poe's own reference to \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", only serves to underscore the connection between the two writers.\n\nPoe's oeuvre is replete with allusions to the German master, a testament to the profound impact Goethe's work had on his own creative vision. His admiration for Tennyson, another English poet, only serves to underscore the breadth of his literary influences. The whispered echoes of Goethe's verse, lingering in the shadows of Poe's works, remind us that the boundaries between art and influence are often blurred, and that the creative impulse can be a labyrinthine path of echoes and reflections.",
            "In the sterile halls of jurisprudence, a question forms, like a slow-burning ember, consuming all in its path. Could a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages in the aftermath of a calamitous slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store? The store manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, and yet he chose to ignore it, engrossed in the fleeting pleasure of his dinner. It is a scenario that bespeaks a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nA judge, wise and detached, would likely deny a motion for summary dismissal of Palmer's claim. To prove that an award of punitive damages is warranted, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction. Furthermore, she must show that Martin's conduct was despicable, a word that conjures images of a soulless, heartless entity, devoid of empathy or compassion. It is a high bar, but one that Palmer may clear, given the evidence of Martin's negligence.\n\nIn the months preceding Palmer's accident, six customers had been injured in slip-and-fall incidents in the same store. These incidents should have served as a clarion warning to Martin, a red flag that signaled a grave and imminent danger. And yet, he chose to ignore it, prioritizing his own convenience over the safety of his patrons. This is no mere oversight; it is a deliberate choice, a conscious decision to put profits above people.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, dismissed the warning, citing his dinner break as an excuse. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference. And it was then, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury.\n\nThe evidence mounts against Martin, a mountain of negligence and malice. Palmer's case is not merely one of carelessness; it is a testament to the systemic failures that allowed a preventable tragedy to occur. The question now is not whether Palmer will prevail, but whether the court will mete out justice, and restore some semblance of balance to a world gone awry.\n\nIn California, the law is clear: punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, in this context, is not merely a fleeting thought; it is a state of mind, a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The law demands a willful and deliberate disregard, a callous indifference to the consequences of one's actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's actions meet the test. He was aware of the probable consequences of his inaction, and yet he chose to ignore them, prioritizing his own interests over the well-being of his customers. This is malice, pure and simple. It is a recklessness that defies comprehension, a callous disregard for the safety of those who trusted him to protect them.\n\nIn the end, it is not merely a question of whether Palmer will win, but whether justice will be served. Will the court recognize the gravity of Martin's actions, and hold him accountable for his negligence? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the law demands justice, and justice demands accountability.",
            "Four winters past I found myself ensnared in the labyrinth of a course on the tenets of Islam at the CBC.  Amidst the fervent debates that raged within the classroom, one question emerged as a behemoth of contention: was Islam a religion born of hostility or of peace?  In the aftermath of that fateful year, 2001, the media's gaze upon Islam had shifted from a withering scorn to an unyielding tolerance.  It was as if the very notion of a presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, whose lineage bore the unmistakable mark of Islam, was an affront to the values of the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, for it stands as a paradox, a tale of contradiction.  The man who was said to have been driven by conviction, who was said to have subdued the tribes through conquest and coercion, now emerges as a martyr, a man of humility and compassion.  His was a story of a man who was misunderstood, who was willing to bend and yield to the will of others, and yet, it was in this very humility that people found the truth, and one by one, they sought him out.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad are striking, and it is this similarity that has long troubled me.  The tale of multiplying mutton and milk, so that there was more than enough for forty men, is a testament to the writer's deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a man of truth, a man who did not need to prove himself, but rather, who lived in the very essence of the divine.  This is a deception, a subtle but insidious lie, for it diminishes the miracle of Jesus Christ, and seeks to co-opt his essence, his very being, for the benefit of another.\n\nMoreover, the stories within the biography seem designed to prove the existence of witnesses, to provide a veritable proof of the truth of the tales.  But these stories, born of third-hand accounts, lack the authenticity that only first-hand testimony can provide.  They are a testimony to the writer's desire to prove the truth, but in doing so, they only serve to erode the credibility of the narrative.\n\nIt is this very exaltation of Muhammad, this portrayal of him as a godly man, a man of humility and compassion, that troubles me the most.  History, however, stands as a stark refutation of this image, and I am left to wonder if the true story of Muhammad's rise to power is one that is known to his followers today.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, once a flame that flickered bright, soon left behind a smoldering ember in the development of Christian thought.  Like a flame that guttered in the darkness, the original intent of Jesus' message was lost in the vast expanse of history.  We see this trend stretched out before us like a desolate landscape, a path that wandered farther and farther from its origin.  The world, now, is a place where awareness stirs, a progressive tide that seeks to reclaim the lost truth.  Yet, traditional minds, like the stubborn roots of an ancient tree, cling to the familiar, resisting any notion that would upend what they have been taught.  They may not be a dominant force, but their presence will be felt, a steady heartbeat that slows the march of progress.\n\nIn time, however, a yearning will grow, a desire to strip away the accretions that have accumulated over the centuries, to reveal the pure, unadulterated essence of the faith.  It will take patience, like the slow burning of a fire that reduces wood to ash, but the outcome is inevitable:  The clock of Christian history will turn backward, and the faithful will be led, like a flock of birds returning to their nesting grounds, back to the original intent of the name that bears its mantle.  One by one, the layers of doctrine will be shed, until only the pure, unvarnished message of Jesus remains, unencumbered by the claims of those who would seek to claim the mantle of his authority.  When this reversal takes hold, sweeping through the United States and Europe like a winter's storm, the church will be transformed, its institution remaining strong, but its theology stripped bare, revealing the simple, unadorned truth of the faith.\n\nThis great reversion is not without precedent.  We see it in the past, like a recurring pattern in the natural world.  Christians, once persecuted and shunned, became the dominant force in the Roman Empire.  Our nation, too, has undergone a similar transformation, emerging from the darkness of slavery to the light of leadership.  The great reversion that is coming will be no different, a story of undoing, of stripping away the accretions of history to reveal the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that has come to characterize the Christian faith.\n\nIt is a crucial distinction that will mark this process:  The words of Jesus will be seen not as literal commands, but as metaphors, their meaning hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.  So what lies beneath the surface of history, waiting to be rediscovered?  We find, at the foundation of the Christian faith, the soil of Judaism, the theology that gave rise to the Christian faith.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, these were the building blocks of the faith, even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  But the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "He believed that the darkness within, the abyss that gnawed at the heart of humanity, was a void of boundless avarice and self-absorption. A chasm that yawned open, revealing a world where the only currency was the advancement of one's own interests, and the well-being of others was but a distant, fading echo. The Jungle laid bare this grotesque spectacle, a gaudy carnival of greed where the owners and managers of the great factories danced with abandon, their eyes fixed on the prize, their souls lost to the abyss.\n\nTheir god was profit, their scripture the bottom line. They cared not for the suffering that their machinations wrought, nor for the lives that were crushed beneath their heel. The smoke that belched from their chimneys was a manifestation of their malevolent disregard, a noxious cloud that shrouded the world, obscuring all that was good and pure. The pens that held the animals, the rivers that ran thick with waste, all were but mere trinkets in the grand game of progress.\n\nTheir employees, mere pawns in this grand scheme, toiled in darkness, their lives a Sisyphean struggle to eke out a meager existence. The hours were long, the labor grueling, and the compensation a paltry handful of coins. And when the whim of the owners struck, the workers were cast aside like so much rubbish, left to fend for themselves in a world that offered little solace. No laws, no regulations, no safety net to catch the falling. Only the cold, unforgiving hand of fate, and the pitiless hearts of those who held the reins.\n\nThe unions, those supposed saviors, were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, preying on the very people they claimed to protect. They feasted on the blood of the workers, leaving them to suffer in the darkness, their cries for help drowned out by the cacophony of greed. And so the workers toiled, their lives but a mere existence, their souls crushed by the weight of their own desperation.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, immorality reigned supreme, a cancer that ate away at the very fabric of society. The Jungle presented a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the voiceless were silenced, and the downtrodden were trampled beneath the feet of the privileged. A world where the only truth was that of the bottom line, and the only morality was that of the dollar.\n\nBut amidst this desolate wasteland, a glimmer of hope flickered, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. For in the darkness, there lay a spark, a flame that burned bright with the promise of resistance, of rebellion, of a better tomorrow. A spark that would one day ignite, casting a fiery glow over the abyss, and illuminating the path to a brighter, more just world.",
            "In the crucible of literature, authors forges the metal of meaning, tempering it with technique, that they might imbue their words with a certain cadence, a certain weight. Some of these techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of manipulation, wields a multitude of these methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He pairs unlikely bedfellows - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an aura around a subject, an exercise in alchemy. Other times, he assigns significance to symbols, only to later reap the benefits of that symbolism. Colors, in particular, prove a fertile ground for Fitzgerald's machinations. He sows the seeds of meaning for certain hues - white/gray and red/pink - and later reaps the harvest of association.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald cultivates a specific connotation for white/gray, a dichotomy that speaks to the very fabric of his narrative. White, in his schema, is a color of elegance, of refinement, of privilege. Gray, on the other hand, is a hue of weariness, of age, of decay. This distinction is first sown in the early pages of the novel, where the use of these colors is as ubiquitous as the ash that chokes the valley of ashes. Daisy and Jordan are forever \"in white,\" their porcelain skin a testament to their social standing. Even the narrator, Nick, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's grand soiree, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when he encounters Myrtle, a woman as faded as the color itself.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by applying these colors to the most mundane of subjects. The streets of New York, for instance, are a \"white chasm,\" a seemingly endless expanse of concrete and steel. Even the names of people at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder that even the elite are bound by the fetters of conformity. The apartment houses, a \"long white cake,\" are a uniform sprawl of sameness, a testament to the crushing homogeneity of modern life.\n\nHowever, it is not until Fitzgerald has sown this meaning that he reap the benefits of his labor. He uses white/gray to signify the unimportance, the uniformity of certain subjects. Daisy, once a vibrant presence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a \"uniform addition\" to Gatsby's world. Her \"white dress\" is a hollow shell of elegance, a reminder of the emptiness at the heart of her character. Even her fur collar is shrouded in a \"gray haze,\" a symbol of the decay that lies beneath her polished surface.\n\nIn the end, Fitzgerald's use of color is a testament to the power of symbolism in literature. By imbuing certain hues with meaning, he creates a rich tapestry of association, a world where the colors of the palette are alive with significance. It is a technique that has captivated readers for generations, a reminder that, in the words of the great author himself, \"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"",
            "The land of San Diego County - a place of plenty, where the sun beats down upon the earth like a hammer upon an anvil. The crops that grow here are a testament to the fertility of the soil and the bounty of the heavens. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with juice and flavor. Citrus fruits hang heavy on the branches, their peels a deep gold in the sunlight. Leafy greens and squash and broccoli and herbs push up through the earth, a verdant carpet that blankets the land. And the tree fruits - peaches and lemons and berries - they grow in profusion, a cornucopia of sweetness and flavor.\n\nIn this land of plenty, there is a growing demand for the kind of food that is grown without the aid of chemicals. Organic community supported agriculture is a thriving enterprise, with many organizations in the San Diego area clamoring for a spot in their programs. The waiting lists are long, a testament to the desire for a cleaner, healthier way of eating. And it is not just the food that is organic - the farms themselves are a draw, with many offering tours and access to hiking and birdwatching trails.\n\nBut the road to success is not an easy one. The landowner must be prepared to put in the work - to till the soil, to plant and harvest, to remove pests and weeds without resorting to chemicals. It is a labor-intensive process, one that requires a deep understanding of the land and its rhythms. And the costs can be high, especially when compared to the large-scale operations that dominate the agricultural landscape. The small organic farm must be efficient, must be able to compete with the big boys on price while also providing a superior product.\n\nAnd yet, there is a reward for this hard work, a reward that goes beyond the profit and loss ledgers. The land, once a barren and lifeless expanse, is transformed into a thriving ecosystem, teeming with life and color. The plants and animals that call this land home are a testament to the power of this way of farming, a way that seeks to work in harmony with nature rather than against it.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This land has a long and storied history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was once part of an original homestead patent, and it is likely that it was used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nToday, this land presents a unique opportunity for a small farmer to create a thriving organic farm, one that not only provides a superior product but also preserves the natural beauty of the area. With the right guidance and support, the landowner could create a model of sustainable agriculture that benefits both the land and the community.\n\nI chose this piece of property from a real estate website and researched the available government programs that a small farmer might use to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. A model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area, one that demonstrates the potential for success in this endeavor.",
            "The chasm between cultures is as vast as the distances that separate us. And yet it's not a chasm of definable edges, but rather a tapestry woven of contrasting threads. A culture is not a singular entity, but rather a multitude of disparate voices that whisper stories of what it is not, as much as what it is. It's a complex weave of the oft-invisible, the unspoken, and the unseen. To attempt to reduce it to broad strokes - \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - is to misunderstand the very essence of its intricacies.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of a foreign culture, one must first grasp the nuances that lie within. It's a journey that begins with the study of its history, the probing of its prejudices, and the recognition of its inherent contradictions. Rather than trying to alter or judge, one must accept it for what it is, a living, breathing entity that defies simplification. In the crucible of negotiation, this acceptance is a virtue, especially when one finds himself at a disadvantage.\n\nBut culture's reach extends far beyond national borders. It seeps into the very marrow of corporate life, manifesting in the dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices of individual companies. A company's culture can be as varied as its employees, with some institutions valuing long hours, while others prioritize flexibility. The evidence of this cultural tapestry is woven into the fabric of everyday life, a reminder that even within the same nation, diversity thrives.\n\nValues, the unseen threads that give culture its strength, are the key to understanding its very essence. If saving face or communal harmony are the guiding principles, a negotiator will think twice before publicly airing his company's dirty laundry. Conversely, a culture that prizes a hard-driven bargain will not be swayed by the promise of a quick resolution. To grasp these subtleties is to grasp the delicate balance of power at the negotiating table.\n\nBut to truly navigate the complexities of a foreign culture, one must also seek to understand the individual who sits across from him. To grasp the personal stories, the motivations, and the desires that drive them. In this, lies the key to effective negotiation, a delicate dance of understanding and empathy that can bridge even the widest of cultural chasms.",
            "Though the fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,' the silence of his words is a hollow echo that rings through the desolate landscape of the soul. This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two venerable thinkers, St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas. Their words, like the faint whispers of a distant wind, seek to convince us of the existence of a divine presence, a being both elusive and all-encompassing.\n\nTo compare these two thinkers, we must first acknowledge that their arguments are a testament to the enduring power of faith. We shall proceed under the assumption that their contemplations are in defense of the God of the Bible, lest we risk comparing apples and oranges in the wilderness of theological debate.\n\nAnselm's path to understanding is a winding road that leads inward, to the recesses of the human heart. He proposes that the existence of God is not something to be discovered in the external world, but rather in the depths of our own understanding. The proof of God's existence lies within the confines of our own mind, a truth that can be intuited by the faithful without the need for empirical evidence. This is a notion that echoes the quiet whispers of the soul, a testament to the power of faith in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more cerebral approach, one that seeks to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical observation. His five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – weave a intricate tapestry of logic that seeks to persuade the doubter with the cold, hard light of reason. Like a master weaver, Aquinas threads together the disparate strands of human experience, creating a fabric of proof that is both convincing and unyielding.\n\nYet, as we examine these arguments, we are left with the nagging sense that neither thinker has provided a comprehensive basis for their beliefs. Their words, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, seem to whisper a truth that is both profound and elusive. In the end, our understanding of God remains a mystery, a labyrinthine path that winds its way through the chambers of the heart.\n\nThus, we are left to ponder the words of the fool, who hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' And we are left to wonder, in the silence of our own hearts, whether the existence of this being is a truth that can be proven, or a faith that must be felt.",
            "In an age long past, before the darkness that had fallen, a prince was born, destined to become the Buddha. His path unwound like a thread through the tapestry of time, from the world's grasp to the stillness of enlightenment. The teachings that flowed from his lips like a river, shaping the contours of a faith that would come to be known as Buddhism. \n\nBut time, that great solvent, had its way with the teachings, eroding the edges, smoothing the rough places. The Theravada sect, a living thing, breathed and adapted, its core unchanged yet its shape shifting to suit the vicissitudes of the world. In the land of Sri Lanka, the water-cutting ceremony unfolded, a pageant of devotion, a testament to the adaptability of the human heart.\n\nMonks and laymen, bound by a shared purpose, participated in this ritual, a tradition that bore no direct link to the Buddha's own words. The fringes of the faith, from the most superficial displays to the very essence of its soteriology, had been reshaped by the forces that buffeted it - the hostile and the benign, the internal and the external.\n\nAs we proceed, certain terms will recur, like the echoes of a distant drumbeat. We speak of internal and external forces, the former born of the Buddha's followers, the latter from outsiders. A hostile force is one that would do harm, that seeks to rend the fabric of the community. A benign force, on the other hand, brings no intention to harm, though its consequences may be far-reaching.\n\nThe core of Theravada Buddhism - the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha - remains steadfast. Refuge lies in this trio, the Buddha, a being of wisdom and compassion; the Dhamma, a body of teachings that seek to illuminate the path; and the Sangha, a community bound by a shared quest for understanding.\n\nAt the heart of the Dhamma lie the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture - the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Concepts like Anatta - the absence of a soul - and Anicca - the impermanence of all things - hold sway, beckoning the follower towards the stillness of the end of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for living, five precepts for the laity, many more for the monastic order. And at the very heart of the teachings lies the Four Noble Truths: that suffering is inherent in life, that attachment brings suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the shadow of time, the twin behemoths of the United States and Mexico stood, their rivalry a festering wound that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. It was a grudging truce between two nations, a ceaseless dance of bitterness and distrust that sprang from the marrow of their shared history. The conflict reached its zenith in the brutal crucible of the Mexican-American War, where the United States, like a behemoth awakened from slumber, crushed its southern neighbor, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. The echoes of that war still lingered, a miasma of resentment that seeped into the marrow of their shared blood.\n\nThis was not an isolated anomaly, for it is in the nature of nations to clash, their borders a razor's edge between rivalries and disputes. The United States and Mexico were not alone in their animosity, their shared border a catalyst for the simmering embers of discord. David M. Pletcher's words echoed through the ages: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations, their shared geography a constant reminder of their entwined fates, only served to fan the flames of their rivalry.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute lay the festering wound of religious differences, a chasm that yawned between the two nations like a great abyss. Sally Frahm's words spoke to the very soul of this divide: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was as if the two nations were locked in an eternal struggle, their ideologies clashing like titans, each side convinced that its own way was the only path to salvation. And yet, this was not merely a matter of politics, but of faith, a deeply ingrained distrust that seeped from the very foundations of their history.\n\nThe distrust between the English and Spanish, those distant forebears, had left an indelible mark on the nations that succeeded them. The United States and Mexico, inheriting this legacy of animosity, stumbled through the early years of their relationship, their steps faltering as they navigated the treacherous waters of their shared past. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes between 1836 and 1893 stood as a testament to the depth of their enmity (2000, p. 145). It was a litany of territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier problems, each confrontation a reminder of the festering wound that lay between them.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the United States and Mexico began to realize that their interests were not mutually exclusive. Schmitt's words spoke to the turning point in their relationship: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109). And with this dependence came a shift in the dynamics of their rivalry, as the United States' ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). It was a slow-burning fuse, but one that would eventually lead to the end of their long and bloody rivalry.",
            "It was a slow unraveling, the threads of my life fraying like the tattered edges of a worn quilt. Fifteen years past, a sudden and inexplicable darkness took hold, a sickness that consumed me whole. I was a nurse then, one who had chosen that path for the promise of security it offered, a refuge from the uncertainties of my own childhood. The words of my elders still echoed in my mind, \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I put aside my dreams, my desires to be a scientist, to be a journalist, and I dedicated myself to the noble work of caring for others.\n\nBut now, as I sit here, my body worn down, my prospects diminished, I am left with nothing but the faint memories of a life once lived. Fifteen years of living on the precipice, clinging to the fragile thread of Social Security Disability, I am a shell of the person I once was. Every day is a battle, a fight for survival, for security, for self-respect. And yet, amidst this abyss, there is one truth that haunts me still. I could not have endured without the kindness of strangers, the selfless acts of those who saw beyond my frailty and reached out to help.\n\nIt is a lesson that has stayed with me, a truth that I cling to in the dark hours of the night. In the face of disaster, we are never alone. We are sustained by the love and compassion of those around us. And so I urge you, do not place all your trust in the crumbling edifice of government. Learn to trust one another, to rely on the kindness of strangers, to ask for help without shame.\n\nFor it was not the rugged individualism of our forebears that sustained them through the hard times, but the very fabric of community, the threads of compassion and mutual respect that bound them together. The pioneers who crossed the vast expanse of the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but together, as a family, as a community.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have done so, gathering the meager tools of survival: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and the faint promise of a life beyond the ashes. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and waterproof matches, canned goods and the whispered hope of a brighter day. But even these meager supplies would mean little without the knowledge of those who would stand by my side, who would offer a helping hand in the face of disaster.\n\nAnd so, I urge you, do not forget the value of community, of kindness, of compassion. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will sustain us, but the love and support of those who stand with us, shoulder to shoulder, in the face of the unknown.",
            "In the depths of existence, a question lingers, a query that gnaws at the very fabric of life: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, like unseen currents in a river, that shape the course of their transformation? Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, dared not attempt to define the simplest of organic forms in mathematical terms. Yet, as the years pass, the pursuit of understanding the intricate dance of evolution continues. Recently, the tools of mathematical modeling have been applied to the mysteries of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the paths of ontogeny and phylogeny like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind (Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur own inquiry delves into the realm of the Prunum, seeking to unravel the threads of evolutionary-developmental change through the marriage of mathematical modeling and experimental study. We have employed X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters of Prunum species, which we then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). The resulting models have allowed us to envision hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, casting a light on the boundaries of possible change in this enigmatic clade.\n\nA shell, that most mysterious of structures, can be seen as a tube traversing the expanse of time, its path marked by the revolutions of the whorls. These whorls, like the pages of a book, spiral around an unseen axis, the columella, a central column that gives the shell its form and function. The speed at which the whorls expand can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, the body whorl, while the spire is composed of all the whorls that precede it. The apex, the tip of the spire, and the base, the opposite end, form the extremities of this intricate, coiled structure.\n\nA shell can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the most common orientation. By counting the whorls, we can unravel the secrets of a shell's growth, beginning with the first suture and dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that allows us to chart the path of the aperture as it travels through time and space, carried by the animal's growth.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, a testament to the power of science to illuminate the unknown. By formulating a mathematical model, we can manipulate the variables, varying the parameters of skeletogenesis and exploring the boundaries of possible forms. And so, we continue to explore, driven by the question that has haunted us since the dawn of time: what lies at the heart of evolution, and how do we unlock its secrets?",
            "In the desolate expanse of Indonesia's recent past, the specter of mortality casts a long and unyielding shadow. For a decade, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has hovered, a steadfast sentinel of a nation's unyielding struggle. Like a withered tree, its branches reaching for a sky shrouded in uncertainty, the country's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals falters, its leaves rustling with the whispers of unfulfilled promises. The echoes of a failing healthcare system reverberate, a haunting reminder that the lifeblood of a nation's future hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe statistics tell a tale of woe, a litany of unmet targets and unfulfilled expectations. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled health worker in attendance, yet the presence of traditional healers, with their limited capacity to intervene in the face of complications, belies the very notion of progress. The maternal death toll, a statistic as unforgiving as the earth itself, remains a stark testament to the system's inadequacies. The percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has dwindled, a steady decline in a country where the very fabric of healthcare appears to be unraveling.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate languishes at a paltry four percent, an indicator of the crippling inequities that beset the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Urban areas, the fabled oases of modernity, boast a rate of seven percent, while rural areas, those forgotten bastions of antiquity, struggle to muster a mere two percent. The chasm between the haves and have-nots, a divide as deep as the Grand Canyon itself, gapes wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that threaten to consume the very heart of the nation's healthcare.\n\nAs the country hurtles toward the precipice of uncertainty, the question looms: how to address the yawning chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots? Should Indonesia chart a path of programmatic interventions, a series of targeted solutions designed to tackle specific ills, or should it focus on strengthening the overall healthcare system, a more holistic approach that seeks to address the very foundations of the problem? The answer, much like the future itself, remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nProgrammatic approaches, those siren songs of quick fixes and fast results, beckon with their promise of swift and tangible progress. Yet, like the sirens of old, they come with a warning: the lure of funding and resources, a Pied Piper's call that draws human capital away from other, equally pressing needs. The duplication of services, a cacophony of competing programs, threatens to drown out the very voices of those in need. In this desolate landscape, the question hangs, a specter of a nation's future, poised on the precipice of uncertainty, waiting for the answer that will determine its very course.",
            "The Victorian novels, those labyrinthine tapestries of detail and aristocratic intrigue, often dwindle to mere shadows of their former selves when one encounters the aberrant threads of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like wayward travelers, strayed from the beaten path, embracing the mystique of the unknown and the bizarre, thus imbuing their characters with a depth that would otherwise have remained hidden. It is in the realm of the unexplained, the inexplicable, that their true essence resides, a realm where the fabric of reality is rent asunder, revealing the jagged contours of their inner lives.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the treacherous landscape of his existence, the boundaries between reality and madness become increasingly tenuous. The cacophony of sounds, the kaleidoscope of images, and the bedlam of emotions that assail him are akin to a maelstrom, pulling him under, sweeping him away on a tide of pain and despair. His mind, a maelstrom of conflicting thoughts and emotions, is beset on all sides by the tumultuous visions of Sikes and Crackit, their angry disputations echoing in his mind like a refrain. And yet, even as he struggles to maintain a tenuous grip on reality, the unseen forces that govern his life seem to mock him, leaving him with a sense of powerlessness, a feeling that he is but a pawn in a game he cannot control.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, Oliver's inner world is revealed, a world of pain and fear, of helplessness and despair. His hallucinations, those dreamlike states that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, serve as a window into his soul, a soul battered and bruised, yet still clinging to the hope of a better life. And it is in these moments of vulnerability that we see the true extent of his defeat, the extent to which he has been broken, his will shattered by the cruel hand of fate.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, where time itself seems to have lost all meaning, the day passes, a fleeting moment, a brief, desperate gasp for air in the void. The silence is oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocates, and the hours seem to stretch out before him like a gauntlet, each one a challenge, a reminder of the long, difficult road that lies ahead.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the mystery is woven into the very fabric of the narrative, a thread that runs through the heart of the story, a story of love and loss, of passion and decay. The dreamlike states that pervade the novel serve as a reminder of the fragility of the human psyche, the way in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy can become blurred, and the ease with which the mind can be led astray.\n\nThus, these two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand apart from the rest, their aberrant threads of mystery and the bizarre weaving a tapestry of depth and complexity, a tapestry that rewards close attention, a tapestry that reveals the hidden contours of the human heart.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of memory, the echoes of a long-forgotten time linger, a time when the outlines of a boy's struggle with the English tongue were etched upon my mind like a fresco on a crumbling wall. He was a child of Latino descent, a boy named Adrian, and his troubles with reading seemed a riddle wrapped in an enigma, a cipher that refused to yield its secrets. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others lay still, mute and unresponsive, a language that seemed to defy comprehension.\n\nI was drawn into this mystery, a tutor in the after-school program, tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of his struggles. And it was there, in that fragile nexus of language and learning, that the truth began to reveal itself, like a slow-burning ember glowing to life in the dark. It was not that he couldn't read, but rather that he didn't know the English alphabet, its shapes and sounds a mystery to him, a language that lay beyond his grasp.\n\nThe revelation struck me like a blow, a sudden and profound understanding of the obstacles that lay before him. And in that moment, I knew that I had stumbled upon a truth that would haunt me forever, a truth that would echo in the chambers of my mind like a refrain, a reminder of the fragility of language and the power of understanding.\n\nThe problem of the language barrier in schools, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children, Adrian's story is a testament to its complexity, a reminder that even in the most unlikely of places, a solution can be found. It is a story of the power of compassion, of the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles.\n\nBut what of the many children who struggle with the English language, children who speak it imperfectly, who stumble over its rhythms and cadences? What of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that seem to offer a panacea, a magic bullet that can cure the affliction of language? The dual language system, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a shining example of the power of bilingualism. But it is not a panacea, a silver bullet that can be fired from a distance, a solution that can be applied with ease.\n\nNo, the key lies in the combination, a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding. It lies in the special aids, the tutors, the bilingual educators who can guide the way, who can navigate the treacherous waters of language and learning. It lies in the recognition that language is not a barrier, but a bridge, a connection to the world beyond, a world of possibilities and promise.\n\nAnd so, I speak of Adrian's story, a story of struggle and triumph, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles. I speak of the language barrier, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children. And I speak of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that require a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own limitations, our own inability to see beyond the horizon, to comprehend the complexity of the world around us. It is our own fear, our own reluctance to adapt, to change. But it is also our own capacity for compassion, for understanding, for empathy. It is our own capacity to see the world through the eyes of another, to hear the whispers of a language that lies beyond our own.\n\nAnd so, let us not be afraid, let us not be hesitant. Let us not be bound by our own limitations, our own fears. Let us instead be open, let us be willing to listen, to learn, to understand. For in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own refusal to see the world in all its complexity, in all its beauty.",
            "In the earliest years of our lives, a notion is sown within us that there is something beyond our mortal grasp. A force, a presence, a power that our small minds struggle to comprehend. Some are led to the hallowed halls of Sunday school, others to the sacred precincts of Temple, while still others search inward for answers that may elude them forever. Many cling to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, while others reject them outright, choosing instead to chart their own course in the dark expanse of existence. The path we choose is a labyrinthine one, winding through the shadows and into the uncertain light of our own perspectives on the divine.\n\nThe evening rain drummed upon the tin roof, a relentless cadence that echoed the turmoil in my heart. My father sat beside me, his eyes lost in the downpour, his gaze a mixture of remembrance and longing. He had grown gaunt, his frame gaunt as the trees that stood skeletal in the winter's grasp. His hair, once a luxuriant mane, now thinned and wisped, like the last wisps of smoke from a dying ember. I felt a shroud of sorrow settle over me, a weight that seemed to crush the air from my lungs. I reached out, my arms encircling him, seeking solace in the warmth of his flesh. We sat together, two figures lost in the rain's melancholy rhythm, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, a bereavement that fell like a dark shroud upon my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, a cruel jest that seemed to mock the very fabric of our existence. I couldn't help but wonder: what manner of God would permit such a fate? I stood alone in the night, my words lost in the void, my thoughts a jumble of anger and despair. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life, the moment when the spark that had animated him for so long was extinguished. I wanted to remember the man he was, not the withered shell that remained. My father would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his mortality, to watch as the life that had given me being slipped away into the darkness. I curled into a ball, a fragile, vulnerable thing, and waited for the news that would shatter my world.\n\nBut the silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that smothered me whole. No one called. No one came. I was left to my own devices, lost in a sea of grief, my heart a heavy stone that dragged me down into the depths of despair.",
            "In the grim tableau of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as an enigmatic monolith, a contradictory union of the antique and the modern. As Ian Watt astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this confounding genre embodies the paradox of 'Old-New'. Critics have long disparaged its supposed vacuity, yet extolled its capacity to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto forged the proto-Gothic mode by combining the antiquated theatricality of the past with the novel's nascent innovations. Walpole dubbed this novelistic marriage 'A Gothic Story', a term that encapsulates the union of the 'old' and the 'new' (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre, with its penchant for medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, stands as a testament to the transience of time. Even in Walpole's era, the term 'Gothic' was a catch-all for disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, bespeaking a bygone era deemed antiquated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. Yet, it is this very synthesis of the theatrical and the novelistic that has allowed the Gothic to endure, to become at once anachronistic and rejuvenated for readers disconnected from its original context.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic lies the concept of Chivalry, an idealized paradigm of the medieval knight, representing honor, valor, and competence. This chivalric ethos, embodied in characters like Frederic, serves as a foil to the perceived moral decay of the present. Walpole, writing in a period of turmoil, likely saw in the Gothic era a lost innocence, a morality he felt was absent in the society of his time. His novel, therefore, becomes a lament for a bygone era, one in which chivalry and honor reigned supreme. Frederic, with his noble lineage, sufferings, and supposed martyrdom, exemplifies the chivalric ideal, albeit with an excess that foreshadows the Gothic trope of hyperbole.\n\nIn the labyrinthine corridors of literary history, the Gothic novel remains an enigma, a genre that resists easy categorization. Its marriage of the antique and the modern has allowed it to transcend time, speaking to readers across the ages with a haunting, timeless elegance.",
            "The winding course of goods through the void of the marketplace is a labyrinth of steps, a procession of processes that bend and twist to deliver the desired object to the supplicant's hand. In the dark of 1982, a figure known as Keith Oliver stumbled upon the term that would give shape to this unseen path: supply chain management. A vagabond of industry, Oliver revealed the hidden contours of the supply chain, a terra incognita that wound from the customer's plea to the raw materials, the production, the storage, and the distribution of products to the customer's door. \n\nSix beacons mark the way through this desolate land: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The navigator of the supply chain, the manager, must chart a course through these elements to chart a course for the customer's satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire enterprise is built. It is here that the manager must divine the will of the market, that vast and unknowable force that dictates the customer's demands. Like a sage divining the future from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, the manager must interpret the signs and portents of the market, that they might produce the goods that the customer desires. And once the manager has grasped the customer's needs, they must decide how to meet them, where to produce the goods, and at what scale. The choices are many, and the consequences of error are dire, for every defect, every delay, every misstep can cascade through the chain like a stone cast into a still pond, sending ripples of cost and chaos through the entire system.\n\nSupply, the second element of the supply chain, is the strategic decisions that guide the manager's hand as they navigate the treacherous waters of production. It is here that they must decide which divisions of the company will produce which goods, and whether to outsource to other companies in the pursuit of velocity, that elusive goal of speed, quality, and low cost. The manager must be a master of the unseen, able to thread the needle of efficiency and effectiveness, lest the entire enterprise come crashing down like a house of cards in a gale.\n\nThus, the manager must weave a tapestry of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, a complex dance of threads that must be pulled tight lest the fabric of the supply chain fray and unravel. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of the market, the customer, and the inner workings of the company itself. And yet, for those who succeed in this endeavor, the rewards are great, for they shall be the masters of the invisible web that binds the world together. \n\nIn the retail stores where I once toiled, I saw this dance played out in the details, the uniform, the receipt of shipment, the flow of goods from production to customer. Each step was choreographed, each move a part of a greater whole, a symphony of supply chain management that played out in the quiet moments of each day. And I saw, too, the consequences of error, the confusion and the chaos that arose when the steps were not followed, when the details were not attended to. But when the process was followed, when the steps were executed with precision and care, the result was a symphony of efficiency and effectiveness, a dance of supply chain management that wove together the threads of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information into a seamless tapestry of customer satisfaction.",
            "A faded sign hung crookedly from a pole, a grim announcement in a land far away. Hitler alive, it declared, in Burma's dark heart. Ellen Page stood alone on a street corner, her cardboard placard held aloft like a banner of despair. Burma, a kingdom ravaged by tyranny, a land where the iron fist of a militant junta had crushed the spirits of its people. A place where the drums of protest had beaten out a cadence of defiance, where monks in saffron robes had marched against the darkness, their voices carrying the wind like a mournful sigh. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of hope, had been brutally snuffed out by the guns and bayonets of the regime. The streets ran red with blood, the monasteries lay in ruin, and the foreign press was silenced, their witnesses to the carnage either imprisoned or killed.\n\nBut Burma was not alone in its suffering. The shadow of oppression loomed over every land, a specter of tyranny that had haunted the very dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing all opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a living deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of modernity and the rituals of the samurai. And in the United States, a land of liberty and freedom, the president held court with a man of God, a man who spoke in tongues of fire and brimstone, his words a litany of hate and intolerance.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square whispered through the ages, their cries of protest muffled by the walls of silence that shrouded the city. The death toll of that fateful night was lost to the ages, a mystery shrouded in the mists of official deceit. But the echoes of the Rwandan genocide lingered, a haunting reminder of the horrors that humanity was capable of inflicting upon itself. And in the depths of the Third Reich, a darkness had descended, a shadow that had consumed the very soul of Europe, leaving nothing but ash and ruin in its wake.\n\nIn this world of darkness, where the light of freedom was but a distant memory, the sign on the street corner seemed a pitiful reminder of the futility of resistance. Yet it stood as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But what was the use of hope in a world where the strong devoured the weak, and the tyrants ruled with an iron fist? The sign seemed a cruel joke, a cruel reminder of the darkness that had consumed all in its path.\n\nEllen Page's eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, a knowledge that the world was a place of shadows and darkness, where the light of hope was but a fleeting dream. She stood there, a solitary figure, a tiny voice crying out in a wilderness of despair. And as the wind rustled her cardboard placard, the words seemed to echo through the ages, a haunting reminder of the human condition in all its brutal simplicity: Hitler alive in Burma, a sign of the darkness that lurked within us all.",
            "The echoing legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz was forged in the crucible of his longevity, a testament to the boundless wellspring of creativity that coursed through him. Like a master craftsman shaping the silences and cadences of his music, Ellington's subtle presence on the piano wove a sonic tapestry that allowed the individual threads of his orchestra to shine forth in all their glory. His compositions were masterful in their ability to provide a framework for soloists to improvise, yet tightly orchestrated to highlight the unique timbres of each player. In this way, Ellington not only showcased the individual talents of his musicians but also imbued his ensemble with a distinctive tone, a harmonic language that spoke to the very soul of the music.\n\nIn his oeuvre, Ellington's mastery of his players' unique voices and the interplay between them allowed him to craft some of the most innovative and sublime works in jazz history. His pioneering use of voice as a jazz instrument, as exemplified in Creole Love Call, was a hallmark of his artistry. This early piece, with its call-and-response structure and six choruses, demonstrated Ellington's ability to elevate the voice to a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. The progression of choruses - from the sweet, melodic call of the first section to the climactic reed-dominated finale - showcased Ellington's skill in crafting a narrative arc that was both subtle and powerful.\n\nIn Creole Love Call, Ellington's innovative use of voice was only one facet of his genius. The piece's carefully crafted structure, with its call-and-response patterns and solos, underscored the importance of texture and timbre in his music. Each chorus was a masterclass in tone color, with the voice, reeds, and brass sections weaving together in a rich and intricate tapestry. The piece's climax, with its syncopated stop-time rhythms and soaring reed melodies, was a testament to Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz expression.\n\nEllington's later works, such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), further demonstrated his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color. In these pieces, he skillfully combined the vocal and instrumental elements of his ensemble to create rich, complementary sounds that elevated the music to new heights. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing in Hot and Bothered was a particularly striking example of Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz, while It Don't Mean a Thing showcased his skill in introducing melodies on muted trombone.\n\nIn Ellington's music, the voice was not just a instrument, but a metaphor for the very essence of jazz itself - a fluid, expressive, and ever-changing entity that could be molded and shaped to evoke the deepest emotions and experiences of the human condition. His legacy, like the music itself, continues to resonate with us, a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that defined his artistry.",
            "A want gnawed within her like an unquiet thing. It had begun when she was a girl, fourteen and just wrestling with the turmoil of adolescent becoming. Three years had passed and the ache persisted, a miasma that refused to lift. She'd narrowed her desires to one thing: a person, a presence to ease the hollow in her chest. Yet, the boys who'd sought her out - and there were some - had failed to stir anything in her. It was as if she'd been a door slammed shut to their gentle knockings. She'd asked herself the same questions, night after night, seeking answers that eluded her like a will-o'-the-wisp in the darkness.\n\nDays at home were a quiet thing, a stillness that wrapped around her like a shroud. Her parents were a calm couple, their arguments rare and usually confined to her assertion of independence. It was as if she'd been forged from a different metal, one that clashed with the gentle temper of her parents. Today was different, though. A scream in the kitchen shattered the peace, and she rushed to the source, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and worry. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushing out in short, desperate breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, her hands trembling as she helped her mother to her feet. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother's hands fumbled for direction, and with a surge of strength, the daughter lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of disinfectant and sickness, a noxious odor that clung to her like a shroud. But she barely noticed, her mind focused on helping her mother. She rushed her to the front desk, calling out for help as doctors and nurses swarmed around them. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her to sit in a waiting room, her mind a jumble of worry and fear. The fall had been from a stepping stool, her mother's attempt to retrieve a vase from the top shelf. It was a trivial thing, a mistake born of haste and distraction. But to her, it was a fracture in the fragile fabric of their lives, a crack that threatened to spread and consume them whole.",
            "In the desolate expanse of existence, where the ravages of time and decay lay bare, a study sought to unravel the secrets of the Mediterranean Diet, that elusive elixir of life. Like a pilgrim's quest, this endeavor aimed to chart the course of fate, tracing the threads of a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" on the tapestry of existence. The aMed diet, a variant of its more storied cousin, the Mediterranean Diet, held promise as a panacea, bolstered by the virtues of plant-based sustenance, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while eschewing the shadows of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of life was allowed, a concession to the frailty of human will.\n\nEchoes of prior studies whispered an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of cardiovascular mortality. A preceding trial had demonstrated the aMed diet's potency in vanquishing the specter of weight gain and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a triumph of science over the capricious whims of fate. Yet, the whispers of prior research had yet to speak to the province of stroke or stroke mortality, a void waiting to be filled.\n\nIn the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were tracked over two decades. The study's authors computed an aMed diet score six times, from 1984 to 2004, harnessing the power of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" to chart the ebb and flow of nutrient intake. The nurses, like sentinels of the health, continued to participate, a testament to the enduring power of human resolve, with more than 95% of the cohort remaining steadfast throughout the study.\n\nEach FFQ, a snapshot of the participants' dietary habits, was scrutinized, validated by the cold light of medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were classified as \"probable,\" a designation bestowed upon about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. The study also accounted for the incalculable variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, as well as the ephemeral quality of leisure-time physical activity, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo temper the vicissitudes of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary habits, the authors averaged the aMed scores from repeated FFQs, a cumulative measure that spoke to the enduring nature of the participants' dietary choices. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, a litany of variables that might otherwise obscure the study's findings.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical construct that pierced the veil of uncertainty, revealed the association between adherence to the aMed diet and the specter of CHD and stroke. The results spoke to a higher aMed diet score, a badge of honor that conferred a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke on the women who bore it. Over the 20-year span of the study, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. The women who inhabited the realm of the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the aMed diet's enduring power to shape the course of existence.",
            "The ruin that had befallen the land was like a slow-moving shadow, creeping across the once-green fields of the economy. It began in the year of 2007, when the United States, that great behemoth of industry and progress, stumbled into the darkness of a crushing financial crisis. The towers of commerce, once proud and unyielding, now crumpled like fallen spires, their shattered remnants strewn across the barren landscape like the bones of some great beast.\n\nIn those days, the winds of recklessness howled through the corridors of power, whispering sweet nothings to the ears of the mighty. Selfish and naive, the politicians of the time, driven by a hunger for power and a lust for the praise of the masses, cast aside the wisdom of the ancient ones, and instead chose a path of destruction. They pressured the great banks and corporations to issue forth a multitude of sub-prime loans, like so many poisonous seeds, scattering them across the land like a plague. And the loans, like a noxious weed, sprouted forth, entwining the very fabric of the economy, strangling its lifeblood.\n\nFannie Mae, that mighty behemoth of finance, and its sister, Freddie Mac, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these rotten loans, like so many diseased carcasses, into the complex structures known as CDO's and CDS's. And when the borrowers, like so many leaves before a hurricane, defaulted on these loans, the banks, like a diseased tree, began to wither and die. The chaos that ensued was like a maelstrom, sweeping away all in its path, leaving naught but ruin and devastation in its wake.\n\nBut the roots of this catastrophe ran deep, like the taproots of some ancient, gnarled tree. It began in the year of 1999, when the Clinton administration, like a great and foolish king, sought to bolster its popularity by relaxing the lending restrictions that had once held the banks in check. And thus, like a slow-moving poison, the seeds of destruction were sown, waiting to sprout forth in the years to come.\n\nThe great Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, had foreseen the consequences of this folly, writing in the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He had seen the writing on the wall, and had warned of the coming storm, but his words fell on deaf ears.\n\nAnd so, like a great and mighty river, the economy flowed headlong into the abyss, its waters churning and foaming with the complex structures of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The households of America, like so many ships on a stormy sea, were over-leveraged and vulnerable, their very existence threatened by the slightest change in the tides of the market.\n\nAnd then, like a great and terrible reckoning, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, like so many great and mighty beasts, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. And in the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold like so many sacrificial lambs, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation.\n\nFannie and Freddie, those great and mighty twins of finance, were left to face the music, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a heavy burden to bear. And in September 2008, they were placed under the control of the government, like so many wayward children, their future uncertain, their fate sealed.\n\nThus, the financial crisis of 2007 was like a great and mighty storm, a tempest that shook the very foundations of the economy, and left in its wake a trail of ruin and devastation. And though the winds may have died down, the damage remains, a constant reminder of the folly of those who would seek to control the uncontrollable, and the price of hubris.",
            "Exposition is that seductive siren, luring the writer down the rocky shores of narrative with promises of ease and efficiency. But it's a treacherous ally, a subtle thief that steals time from the tale, leaving the reader adrift in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nWe've all been there, caught in the undertow of too much information, our minds numbed by the weight of unnecessary exposition. Dr. Merlin's eyes glaze over as she scans the page, her mind screaming for the writer to show, not tell. The words blur together, a jumbled mess of backstory and history, until she's tempted to shout at the screen, to wrestle the writer to the ground and demand a more nuanced approach.\n\nExposition is the easy way out, the lazy choice that says, \"Just get this out of the way, and then we can get to the good stuff.\" But the good stuff is precisely what's lost in the telling. When a writer falls back on exposition, they're not only cheating themselves but also their readers, who crave the subtle dance of suggestion, the whispered hints that leave the imagination to fill in the blanks.\n\nConsider the heroine who meets her beloved, only to have the entire sequence of events recounted in a dry, prosaic manner. The reader is left with a hollow feeling, a sense that the story's potential has been squandered on a lazy narrative shortcut. Where are the moments of tender intimacy? The whispered promises? The stolen glances that speak volumes? These are the things that make us care, that make us invest in the characters and their struggles.\n\nIn the best of fiction, exposition is a subtle thing, a whispered aside that reveals character and context without overwhelming the reader. It's the gentle touch that awakens the imagination, allowing the reader to fill in the gaps and become an active participant in the story. Anything more, and we risk losing ourselves in a sea of unnecessary detail, our minds numbed by the weight of too much information.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the siren's song of exposition. It may promise ease and efficiency, but it's a lie. The true magic happens in the spaces between the words, in the suggestions, the implications, and the silences. Leave room for the reader's imagination to breathe, and you'll find that your story comes alive in ways you never thought possible.",
            "He sat in the dark, his eyes fixed on the glowing screen. The news crawled across it like a diseased thing, eating away at the edges of his mind. He watched as the faces of the damned passed before him, their stories a litany of violence and despair. In Columbus, Ohio, a man named Shad Hostettler had committed a heinous crime, his mug shot a twisted mockery of a smile. The news anchor's voice dripped with a false sense of importance, a fleeting concern for the victim's fate, before moving on to the next tale of woe. \n\nA young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, his life hanging by a thread. The SWAT team was on the case, but the details were scarce, the narrative sparse. The anchor's voice faltered, a hesitation in the delivery, a telltale sign that this was a story that didn't quite fit the mold. A black neighborhood, a black victim – a story best left unspoken, or at least, unremarked upon.\n\nThe news continued, a jarring montage of images and voices, each one a reminder of the world's indifference. A gunshot hole in a helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a five-thousand dollar reward for information. The anchor's voice rose and fell, a maudlin melody, as the camera panned across the landscape, a desolate expanse of ash and ruin.\n\nAnd then, the stories of the marginalized, the forgotten. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie, the emphasis on his appearance a telling sign of the world's biases. The anchor's voice dripped with a sense of menace, as if the very act of describing the perpetrator was a crime in and of itself.\n\nA convicted Texas drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic man with a 25-year sentence, or rather, 300 months. The anchor's voice paused, a calculated pause, as if to emphasize the severity of the punishment. But was it a attempt to make the sentence sound more palatable, more acceptable? The anchor's words hung in the air, a faint whisper of a question, a hint of a doubt.\n\nAs the news continued, the faces of the damned blended together, their stories indistinguishable from one another. The world outside was a cold, unforgiving place, a place where lives were reduced to mere headlines, and the only constant was the endless cycle of violence and despair. He turned off the screen, the glow fading into the darkness, leaving him with only the echoes of the damned.",
            "The bond between brothers is a thing of unyielding ferocity, a tether that binds them together in the crucible of their shared existence. Within this bond, a cauldron of emotions simmers: the tender warmth of love, the acid sting of jealousy, and the dark stains of cruelty. Brothers see themselves in one another, their own reflections staring back at them like a ghostly apparition. And it is in the depths of desperation, when the world around them is reduced to a desolate expanse, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this knowledge is steep, a reckoning that weighs heavily upon the heart. To gaze into the eyes of a brother is to confront one's own visage, unvarnished and unflinching. In the actions that follow, the true character of the brother is revealed, a tapestry woven from the threads of their shared experiences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers navigate this treacherous terrain, their journey a futile quest through a landscape as beautiful as it is unforgiving. The bitter disappointment that festers within them is a palpable thing, a wound that sears the soul. And yet, it is in the crucible of this emotion that pride is tempered, a double-edged sword that cuts both ways. The climactic scene, a moment of unbridled fury, is the culmination of a lifetime of unspoken resentments and long-held desires. Only one brother escapes the carnage, his life a testament to the indomitable will to survive.\n\nThrough direct characterization and the narrator's unflinching gaze, the complexities of the protagonist's emotions are laid bare. His actions, a twisted web of pride and resentment, are a tangled skein that cannot be unraveled. From the moment he and his brother, Doodle, step into the swamp, the narrator's voice whispers a haunting melody, a dirge that underscores the protagonist's unyielding obsession with his own desires. He had envisioned a brother who would be his equal, a partner in every sense of the word. But Doodle's fragile form, a reminder of the fragile thread that binds life to death, is an affront to his grandiose plans.\n\nThe protagonist's heart seethes with anger, a cauldron of resentment that threatens to boil over at any moment. He recalls the dark thought that had crept into his mind, a monstrous impulse to silence Doodle's fragile voice forever. And yet, it is in the brief, shining moment when Doodle smiles that his conviction wavers, a fleeting glimpse of a love that has been hidden beneath the surface all along. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a brother forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own making.\n\nThe bond between brothers is a thing of unyielding ferocity, a bond that cannot be broken. It is a crucible, a testing ground where the very fabric of their existence is forged. And in the end, it is this bond that proves to be the protagonist's undoing, a double-edged sword that cuts both ways, leaving only one brother standing, his life a testament to the indomitable will to survive.",
            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the human mind, a complex tapestry of creative information weaving unfolds. As the fabric of technology has evolved from its primordial threads to the intricate patterns of the modern era, so too have the metaphors that sought to describe the brain's mysterious workings. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, a blank slate awaiting the inscription of thought. Then, like a papyrus scroll, it was seen as a surface upon which the ink of experience was poured. The book, a vessel for the collected knowledge of humanity, came next, its pages dog-eared and worn from the weight of understanding. And now, in our era of wonder, it is likened to a computer, a device that processes information with the cold efficiency of a mechanical heart.\n\nBut even as we employ these metaphors, we must be mindful of their limitations, lest we succumb to the pitfall of erroneous conclusions. For the brain is a far more wondrous and intricate machine than any of these analogies can hope to capture.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs, those gatekeepers of the physical world, which transmute the raw data of the universe into electrochemical signals. These signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are swept up and transformed by the brain's algorithms, both from below and from above. Bottom-up processing, like a river flowing downhill, gathers disparate threads of information and weaves them into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, on the other hand, like a master weaver, uses the fruits of this labor to guide the recognition of patterns and meaning.\n\nAs the information is processed, an attention filter, like a skilled editor, sifts through the detritus of the mind, deciding which signals are worthy of notice and which may be discarded. And though the brain may process every blade of grass beneath our feet, it is the attention filter that allows us to pick out our name, spoken in a cacophony of noise.\n\nThe brain's storage facilities are a labyrinth of memory, with multiple compartments for sensory, working, and long-term information. Information is encoded, like a letter inscribed on a parchment, in various ways depending on the type of sensory stimulus it has received. Verbal input, for example, may be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like a message written in different alphabets.\n\nBut how is this information maintained? Studies of the animal kingdom suggest that working memory, that fleeting repository of information, is sustained by an electrical signal that loops through a series of neurons like a whispered secret. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be anchored in the very fabric of proteins, like a ship's anchor in the bedrock of the sea floor.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery that has been approached from multiple angles. Some models are based on the way humans retrieve memories, like a map of a forgotten city. Others are drawn from the realm of computer science, where algorithms and data streams weave together to form a tapestry of understanding. And still others are derived from the study of neurophysiology, where the intricate dance of neurons and synapses is observed in all its glory.\n\nThe semantic network model, like a great spider's web, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" may be linked to \"table,\" which in turn may be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But even as we seek to understand the brain's workings through these metaphors and models, we must remain aware of their limitations, lest we become entangled in the very web of our own making.",
            "The scorching critique of technology and the capitalistic underbelly that nurtures it can be seen in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World. The author's scathing indictment of a society that values community above the individual, and immediate gratification above all else, is a searing rebuke of the excesses of modernity. The people, reduced to mere automatons, are conditioned to pursue happiness with a single-minded ferocity, their minds numbed by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and desire.\n\nAs one peers through the lens of Marxist thought, the underlying suspicions of Huxley's critique become apparent. The novelties of modernity - the homogeny of thought, the reification of human experience - are revealed as a cleverly constructed snare, designed to ensnare the unwary in a web of false consciousness. The common citizenry, conditioned to pursue their own selfish interests above all else, are naively unaware of their true position in the grand scheme of things. They are pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, their motivations reduced to a simplistic calculus of gain and pleasure.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, achieved through the ubiquitous use of hypnopædia, is a masterstroke of ideological control. The lower classes, reduced to a state of mindless conformity, are oblivious to the manipulation that surrounds them. They are trapped in a cycle of consumption and desire, their wills reduced to mere automatism. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, are equally complicit, their actions a mere ratification of the existing order.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are a sterile, hollow thing, devoid of depth or meaning. The characters exist in a state of suspended animation, their emotions reduced to a series of shallow, affectless interactions. The novel's refusal to distinguish between characters is a powerful commentary on the dehumanizing effects of modernity. Love, passion, and creativity are absent, replaced by a lifeless, soulless existence.\n\nThe complacency of each social class in their designated role is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. They are trapped in a never-ending cycle of consumption and obedience, their individuality reduced to a mere abstraction. The novel's portrayal of a society in which relationships are reduced to superficial, transactional exchanges is a stinging indictment of the excesses of modernity.\n\nHuxley's critique of Brave New World is a searing rebuke of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. His novel is a warning, a dire prophecy of a future in which humanity is reduced to a mere commodity, a mere cog in the machinery of consumption and desire. The novel's themes of false consciousness, homogeny, and reification are a powerful indictment of the excesses of modernity, a rebuke to a society that values the superficial above the profound.",
            "I've spent nigh on two and a half years wandering these hallowed halls, or rather, navigating the labyrinthine paths that crisscross our campus. For many, including myself, the simple act of traversing this sprawling landscape can be a Sisyphean task. My freshman year, I found myself consigned to a dorm room in the distant reaches of East Halls, a bastion of solitude that seemed as far removed from the thrumming heartbeat of campus as the surrounding woods from the concrete canyons. The trek from my Stuart Hall abode to the far-flung Willard building, that stalwart sentinel of academic rigor, could stretch on for a quarter hour or more, a seemingly interminable expanse of tarmac and pavement that seemed to stretch out before me like a vast, gray sea. Weathered skies and biting winds only served to slow my progress, casting a pall of despondency over the entire endeavor.\n\nBut I have since learned that this was not always so. In days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood as an island, a self-contained bastion of student life, shrouded in a sea of untamed wilderness. The intervening years have seen this empty expanse transformed into a veritable cornucopia of athletic fields, gleaming edifices, and sleek, modern dwellings. The campus, it seems, is forever in flux, a living, breathing entity that shifts and morphs before our very eyes. And with this metamorphosis comes a growing sense of dislocation, a disorientation that threatens to engulf us all.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, I find myself drawn to the humble bicycle as the solution to our mobility woes. But, I dare say, it is not the bike itself that holds the key, but rather our willingness to ride it, to harness its power and channel it towards our collective betterment. The campus, too, must be reshaped in our image, its corridors and thoroughfares designed with the bicycle in mind. Only then can we hope to reclaim our place within this ever-shifting landscape.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who, after a several-year hiatus, has once again taken to the saddle. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"but for a few years, it just wasn't cool to ride a bike. But it's the only way to get around.\" And I find myself in fervent agreement. Not only does cycling offer a modicum of physical exercise, but it also represents the most efficient means of traversing this sprawling campus. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a brief exertion can carry me 30 miles or more, leaving me with the time and energy to pursue my studies unencumbered.\n\nI, too, have found myself forced to navigate the treacherous expanse of Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building from my off-campus abode. The road itself is a gauntlet, a gauntlet that demands focus and fortitude from those who dare to traverse it. But with my trusty steed by my side, I am able to shave precious minutes from my daily commute, cutting the 25-minute walk down to a mere 5 minutes. And though walking has its own merits, I fear I am too beset by the demands of academia to indulge in such leisurely pursuits. Were it not for my bicycle, walking would be my sole option, a Sisyphean task that would drain my time and energy, leaving me drained and spent.\n\nAnd so, I implore our campus leaders to reconsider the needs of the bicycle, to recognize its potential as a unifying force, a thread that weaves our disparate paths together into a tapestry of shared experience. For in embracing the bicycle, we may yet find a solution to the problem of mobility, a solution that will carry us forward, into a brighter, more vibrant future."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I intend to pursue a career within the realm of social work, drawing upon the mandate of the Division of Family and Children Services to aid in the rehabilitation of children who have been subjected to abuse and neglect; and to offer succor to families beset by turmoil. Core tenets that I shall uphold in this pursuit include service, deference, an unyielding commitment to the amelioration of relationships between individuals and families, and a perpetual striving to hone my professional competence, that I may remain an instrument of positive change in this endeavor.\n\nMy inclination towards a life of service has been a driving force throughout my existence. However, the pathway to this vocation has been shrouded in uncertainty. As I navigated the labyrinthine corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many individuals fleeing from the shadows of their problems, ensconced in denial, and others employing coping mechanisms that were far from ideal. It was amidst these scenes of turmoil that I became cognizant of the imperative to help others. My graduation from Piedmont College in 2009 did little to alleviate this sense of purposelessness, and it was not until I encountered a 16-year-old boy, fleeing the cruel whims of his parents, that my resolve was solidified. This young individual, wracked by the anguish of his circumstances, had called upon the authorities for succor, but his pleas had fallen on deaf ears. I chose to intervene, sharing my concerns with the police and frankly explaining my educational background in psychology. As a direct result of my prodding, the boy's parents were forced to confront the gravity of their actions, and though the outcome was far from satisfactory, it galvanized me to pursue a career in social work, wherein I could make a tangible difference in the lives of children such as this.\n\nIn my journey thus far, I have come to understand the paramount importance of social justice. Our society often espouses the notion that the individual is paramount, yet we simultaneously strive for conformity, stifling the true spirit of individuality. I, for one, refuse to be bound by the shackles of conformity, and I shall continue to speak out against the injustices that I witness, whether it be through my attire, my affiliation with the GSBA, or my unwavering commitment to combating racism and discrimination. The pursuit of social justice is not merely a duty, but a sacred obligation, one that I shall uphold, even in the face of adversity.",
            "In the depths of the labyrinthine corridors of sleep, a disorder reigns supreme: insomnia. Two models vie for dominance, each seeking to explain the enigmatic affliction: the Biological model, which delves into the genetic and physiological underpinnings of sleep, and the Sociocultural model, which charts the complex interplay of environmental influences on sleep patterns. This treatise will navigate the dark, winding paths of insomnia, tracing the contours of each model, and excavating the research that illuminates their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a primary sleep disorder, can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder in tandem with another mental affliction, or a sleep disorder triggered by medical complications or substance intake. The Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. The latter, a catch-all category, encompasses the complexities of sleep disorders that defy categorization. Primary Insomnia, a malady of inadequate or disrupted sleep, has its counterpart in Primary Hypersomnia, a condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, both enduring for at least a month. Narcolepsy, a disorder of sudden, intense sleepiness, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssonmias, in their focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, serve as a counterpoint to the Parasomnias, sleep disorders that manifest as behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences. Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder are the archetypes of the Parasomnias, each a manifestation of the darker aspects of the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThe Biological model, a cartographer of the genetic and physiological terrain of sleep, seeks to chart the neural pathways that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a nexus of neural activity, harbors neurons containing orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, receptors that play a pivotal role in modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate somnolence. The study's findings, gleaned from animal models, suggest a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, a receptor whose malfunction can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle. The sociocultural implications of this research are far-reaching, suggesting that an inherited phenotype can regulate sleep, and alterations to the receptor can naturally disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life.",
            "The dimly lit recesses of the mind, where sound and sense converge, are the domain of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition that shrouds the brain's ability to translate the cacophony of the world into meaning. A disorder of the central nervous system, where the echoes of the past and the whispers of the present compete for attention, CAPD is a labyrinth of incomplete perceptions, a maze of missed signals and misinterpreted cues. It is not a disorder of the ears, but of the brain, a fault line that runs deep, where the machinery of comprehension falters, and the whispers of the world are lost in the void.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began to unravel the threads of auditory imperception. Their work, like a faint thread in the darkness, guided subsequent researchers, including Kimura, who, in 1961, shed light on the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception. The national conference of 1977, a rendezvous of minds, marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift.\n\nBut the manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that stretch across the landscape. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between two competing whispers. The sounds of the world may become a jumbled mess, a cacophony of confusion, as the brain struggles to make sense of the chaos. The sequence of sounds may become a jumbled puzzle, as the individual struggles to untangle the threads of time and space. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves lost, unable to navigate the shifting sands of sound.\n\nDiagnosis, like a beacon in the darkness, offers a glimmer of hope. The process begins with a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, a probing of the recesses of the mind. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others, armed with a variety of measures, seek to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the individual, to unravel the tangled threads of perception. But there is no single tool, no one test, that holds the key to diagnosis, only a patchwork of assessments, a quilt of incomplete understandings.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the classroom, where the fabric of education is woven, that the teacher must navigate the complexities of CAPD. In the mainstreamed classroom, where the din of distractions and the hum of disorder compete for attention, the teacher must be attuned to the subtle signs of CAPD, the whispers of confusion, the echoes of disconnection. It is here, in this crucible of learning, that the teacher must be a guide, a navigator, a guardian of the fragile thread of comprehension. For in the labyrinth of the mind, where CAPD reigns, the teacher holds the key to unlocking the secrets of sound and sense.",
            "In the shadowed pages of Twelfth Night, a truth unspoken festers like an open sore. The deception of disguise, a fragile veil that shields us from the cruel winds of reality, threatens to consume us whole. As we don our masks, we risk losing ourselves in the process, our true selves cast aside like autumn leaves on a forgotten wind. And when the moment of truth arrives, we must confront the choice: to shed the disguise and risk the consequences, or to cling to the fragile threads of deception, sacrificing the relationships that bind us to the world.\n\nIn the realm of gender role reversal, the stakes are particularly high. The why of our deception is a question that gnaws at the heart, a whispered inquiry into the depths of our own natures. Viola, a traveler in a foreign land, assumes the guise of a man to shield herself from the predators that lurk in every shadow. Her ruse is a success, yet it comes at a steep price: she is set adrift from the very women who might have offered her a lifeline in this strange and unforgiving world. The weight of her deception bears down upon her, a constant reminder of the fragile web of relationships she has spun.\n\nAnd then, there is the tangled web of desire that ensnares Olivia and Orsino. Viola's disguise serves as a catalyst, forcing them to confront the suppressed longings that lie hidden beneath their surface. Is Olivia's affection for Cesario a genuine emotion, or merely a product of her own blind prejudices? Does she see in Cesario a reflection of her own repressed desires, or does she merely use him as a proxy for her own fascination with the unattainable? The ambiguity of her feelings is a piercing commentary on the societal norms that govern our perceptions of love and desire.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a harsh truth: that our deceptions, though they may offer us temporary shelter from the storms of life, can also lead us further into the darkness. We must confront the masks we wear, and the choices we make, for it is in the act of shedding our disguises that we may discover our true selves, and the world around us, in all its beauty and its brutality.",
            "The ruin of their rule casts a long and malignant shadow across the landscape of South West Africa. The brutal suppression of the Ovaherero and Nama, their genocide a stark reminder of the German colonial empire's baser impulses. Not that it can be reduced to such a simple narrative - the empire's policies and styles varying as wildly as its geography. Education, too, was a disparate and fractured thing, a patchwork of provision across the colonies. In East Africa, where the British would later take hold, the government had established a system of state schools, educating a generation of literate and informed Africans. Yet in South West Africa, a stark and foreboding contrast emerged. The burden of native education was shouldered by missionary societies, limping along on the slender thread of government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished its resources on the education of its own kind, establishing a network of state schools and closely regulating the missionary endeavors that catered to the native masses. The impact of this disparity would be felt for years to come, a scar etched deep into the very fabric of South West Africa.\n\nIn this peculiar and benighted corner of the empire, the majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and lost to the darkness of ignorance. What factors contributed to this divergence? What currents of thought and policy flowed through the minds of settlers and colonial authorities, shaping the course of events in South West Africa? This inquiry seeks to plumb the depths of this question, to identify the underlying forces that forged the colony's unique trajectory.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, but much of it remains locked behind the veil of language and time. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, were often content to simply chronicle the features of educational systems in each colony. Later studies, written in the English tongue, expanded the discussion through comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. One study, penned by Cohen, shed light on the particularities of South West Africa and East Africa, highlighting the factors that set them apart. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, was a land of contrasts, a place where the harsh realities of desert and desertion met the fragile hopes of European settlement. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in this unforgiving landscape, a significant presence in a territory that seemed to stretch out before them like an empty and desolate sea. In comparison, the settler population of East Africa was a mere 5,336, a paltry number in a colony that seemed to hold out the promise of a new and better life.",
            "In the depths of time, a morass of sound has come to be known as Popular Music. A hydra-like beast, it has grown and multiplied over the past century, its tendrils spreading far and wide, giving birth to a multitude of genres that defy easy classification. Within these genres, sub-genres have sprouted like weeds, their own offspring bursting forth in a dizzying array of diversity. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, that most tempestuous and expressive of all, has come to be a behemoth, its influence spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of sound.\n\nLike a raven's call in the dark of night, Heavy Metal resounds with a primal, almost feral energy, its emotions running the gamut from the deepest despair to the most frenzied ecstasy. And yet, it is a music of restraint, its fury and passion held in check by the precision and skill of its practitioners. Like a dark and ancient ritual, it has evolved over the years, its adherents seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible, to tap into the very essence of the music itself.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was little more than a whisper, a faint hint of something new and different in the air. But as the years went by, it grew in power and complexity, its tendrils reaching out to claim new territory, to incorporate the influences of other genres and styles. And yet, despite its diversity, Heavy Metal remains a movement, a force that drives its adherents to push the boundaries of what is possible, to seek out new and darker sounds, and to express the depths of human emotion in a way that is both cathartic and terrifying.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that revels in the primitive and the visceral, that seeks to tap into the raw emotions of the human heart. And yet, it is also a music of precision and skill, its practitioners honing their craft to create a sound that is at once both beautiful and brutal.\n\nOne need look no further than the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" to see the seeds of Heavy Metal sown. A song of raw, unbridled energy, it is a testament to the power of the music to capture the darkness and the chaos of the human experience. And yet, it is also a song of precision and control, its rhythms and harmonies carefully crafted to create a sense of tension and release that is at once both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a music that defies easy categorization, a hydra-like beast that is always changing, always evolving. But at its core, it remains a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that speaks to our deepest fears and our greatest passions, a music that is both beautiful and brutal, and that will continue to captivate and inspire us for generations to come.",
            "In the realms of the art world, a quiet dreamer named Henri Rousseau toiled, his brushstrokes driven by the whispers of a longing that had haunted him for years. A painter of unassuming talent, he sought to transcend the mundane boundaries of his existence and leave an indelible mark upon the world. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stood as a testament to the turmoil that raged within him - a struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the conventions of a world that seemed determined to stifle his creativity.\n\nAs one delves into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's life, the threads of his biographical tapestry begin to unravel, revealing a man beset on all sides by the cruel whims of fate. Born into a world of modest means in the northwest French town of Laval, Henri Rousseau's early years were marked by the prosaic drudgery of a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee. It was not until the unforgiving hand of mortality claimed his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, that he found solace in the gentle solace of art. The ache of his grief, though still raw, was slowly soothed by the gentle caress of his brushstrokes, as he poured his heart and soul onto the canvas.\n\nIn a world where the art world's elite seemed to congregate around the likes of Matisse, a painter of refinement and elegance, Rousseau found himself an outsider, a folk painter driven by the simple, unpretentious desires of the common man. His art, a reflection of his own unyielding hopes and dreams, was a far cry from the romanticized portrayals of the peasantry that captivated the hearts of his contemporaries. And yet, it was this very authenticity that would ultimately become the source of his torment - a constant struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the stifling conventions of a world that seemed determined to ignore him.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the chasm between Rousseau and Matisse was not merely one of style or subject matter, but of purpose itself. While Matisse's art was driven by a terror of mediocrity, Rousseau's was fueled by a desire to conform, to be accepted by the very same art world that seemed to mock him. It was a dichotomy that would haunt him for the rest of his days, a constant reminder that his art, like his very existence, was a fragile, flickering flame, vulnerable to the whims of fate.\n\nIn the Dream, we see Rousseau's own inner turmoil, a maelstrom of conflicting desires and doubts that threatened to consume him whole. It is a painting of unassuming beauty, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. And it is in this very painting that we find the key to understanding Rousseau's enduring legacy - a legacy that transcends the boundaries of style and technique, speaking instead to the very heart of the human experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a whispered truth echoes through the ages: that ethics and aesthetics are bound together by an unseen thread, a delicate weave of beauty and truth. Like the first light of dawn creeping over a ravaged landscape, this connection beckons us to explore the depths of the human experience. John Keats, in his immortal \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" reminds us that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" But how do we come to this understanding? Is it through the dusty tomes of academia or the trials of life? Or perhaps it is something more primal, a whisper in the darkness that guides us towards the elusive essence of beauty and morality.\n\nWe seek to explain the unexplainable, to grasp the slippery tendrils of truth that dance just beyond our fingertips. Our studies of morality and beauty are a perpetual dance of description and prescription, a futile attempt to pin the ephemeral to the page. We speak of foreground and background, of context and contrast, but these words, like autumn leaves, wither and fade the moment we grasp them. The critics' analyses, like the shifting sands of a desert oasis, prove hollow and unsatisfying, a meager substitute for the whispered truth that only the soul can hear.\n\nWhen asked to explain the magic of a masterpiece, we often falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase \"There's just something about it.\" This, I believe, is the transcendental nature of art and morality, that elusive je ne sais quoi that defies capture. It is the whispered promise of the sublime, the quiet voice that speaks directly to the heart. As Flannery O'Connor so eloquently puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And so, too, with ethics: a description, no matter how complete, cannot fully capture the essence of what is right or wrong.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened when we experience them in a state of noumenal awareness, a realm beyond the limits of language and reason. It is a realm where the distinctions between art and life blur, and the values we hold dear are revealed in all their beauty and complexity. As McKean reminds us, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" In this desolate world, where the boundaries between art and life have grown indistinct, we find the whispered truth that binds us all: that beauty and truth are one, and that their connection is the very essence of the human experience.",
            "The land of Germany, a realm forged from the crucible of disparate cultures, its essence distilled from the confluence of Alpine shadows to the Baltic's gray expanse. The Rhine's flow, like a lifeblood, courses through its heart, nourishing the cities of München and Kiel, Köln and Dresden. A land of contradictions, born of various tribes and sources, yet united in its resilience. The Germania, as the ancestral land of the Germans, its origins shrouded in mystery, a tale of disputed etymology.\n\nSome say the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others claim Julius Caesar's use of the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars originated from the Gauls themselves, a distinction made to separate the conquered from the unconquered (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Still, others propose that it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue, or perhaps the spear, the \"ger,\" used in ancient warfare (O.E.D, 2010). The Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" may also be a possible source, hinting at the Germans' reputation for loudness.\n\nIn his writings, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" regarded the Germans as aboriginal, unadulterated by foreign bloodlines (Tacitus, 98). He described their land as inhospitable, their people as sullen and taciturn. Who would brave the unforgiving climate and harsh landscape to leave behind the comforts of Italy and Rome for the unknowns of Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet. They would send out expeditions to exploit the land's resources, but ultimately return to their dominion.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they inhabited the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills in exchange for Roman patronage (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). Thus, the foundation of modern Germany was laid, a tapestry woven from the threads of various cultures, its essence forever tied to the land of Germania.",
            "I gazed down at the view before me, my mind a blank slate, inscrutable and unyielding.  The scene unfolded before me like a canvas, awaiting the strokes of some unseen hand.  My thoughts drifted in like wisps of smoke, vanishing as swiftly as they appeared.  I was a vessel, a hollow reed, blown by the winds of perception.  My consciousness flowed like a river, unencumbered by the weight of thought or emotion.  I was a mere observer, a traveler on the banks of a vast and uncharted sea.\n\nI recalled the words of an artist who had once counseled me: \"Frame the picture, see the world anew.\"  I had stumbled upon an old book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which claimed to hold the secrets of perception.  The book spoke of the power of the square frame, of how it could transform the intricate web of life into a simple, graspable whole.  I had sought to apply this principle to my own creative endeavors, to see the world with fresh eyes.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, my mind was a maelstrom of confusion.  The colors, the shapes, the textures - all swirled together in a maddening dance.  I was lost, adrift in a sea of sensation.  I longed to impose order on the chaos, to frame the picture and see the world anew.\n\nAnd then, like a whispered secret, the artist's frame appeared.  A square of simplicity, a border of clarity.  The world snapped into focus, and I beheld the bowl, a bowl of fruit, a simple, elegantly formed object, suspended in a sea of nothingness.  I was Picasso in his blue phase, Monet in his green, the Italian Renaissance masters in their rainbow of colors - I was an artist, a weaver of worlds.\n\nMy hand reached out, a brush poised to strike, my fingers trembling with anticipation.  The handle of the pencil, a tool of creation, felt alive in my hand.  I brought it to the paper, a sheet of blank and waiting possibility.  And then, like a burst of creation, my hand moved, a flow of movement and energy, a dance of life.\n\nBut my hand faltered, and my attention turned to the toilet, a vessel of waste and decay.  A brown package, a slug-like thing, clung to the bottom of the bowl.  I gripped the mop, a tool of cleansing, and my hand moved, a slow and deliberate dance, a ritual of purification.  I was a priest, a minister of the mundane, a weaver of the everyday.\n\nAs I stood, my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie knotted around my neck, I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of processed matter, a thing without form or purpose.  I was a servant, a janitor, a cleaner of the unspeakable.  My hand reached out, a hand of service, and I began to wipe, to cleanse, to purify.\n\nAnd then, like a mother, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a gesture of devotion, a ritual of care.  I was a servant, a caretaker, a weaver of the everyday.  The world, a vast and mysterious tapestry, unfolded before me, a canvas of endless possibility.",
            "The wilderness of the highway, a killing field where the young and reckless are consumed by their own momentum. The statistics scream of a wanton disregard for life, a heedless dance with death on wheels. The National Institutes of Health reveal a cold truth: the adolescent brain, still a fledgling in its formative years, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. The fragility of inexperience, a chasm of uncertainty, yawns open, waiting to swallow the unwary whole. It is here, in this desolate expanse, that the adolescent's recklessness finds its inevitable end.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center laid bare the correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. The numbers tell a tale of a reckless abandon, a wanton disregard for the lives at stake. The state of California, and others, have attempted to stem the tide of this calamity with provisional licenses, their hours of operation curtailed, their passengers limited to those of a certain age. But these measures, stopgaps though they may be, are feeble attempts to stem the tide of a far more profound issue.\n\nThe problem, you see, is not one of licensing or restriction, but rather of a fundamental inability to grapple with the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19-20 is too young for the unfettered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of the thrill, a siren's call to the young and reckless, is a powerful force, one that cannot be easily resisted. To issue driver's licenses to those too young to temper their impulses is to invite disaster, to court a death toll that will rise to catastrophic levels in the years to come. The baby-boomer's children, a tidal wave of new drivers, will soon flood the roads, bringing with them a renewed wave of carnage.\n\nLegislation, then, is the only bulwark against this maelstrom. Schools must continue to provide driver's education, a primer for the novice behind the wheel. But the key lies in waiting, in holding back the reins until the adolescent brain has matured, until the tendency to take risks has begun to wane. A national law, uniform and unyielding, would provide the necessary framework, a shield against the recklessness that threatens to consume us all. The hours of training, the number of practice sessions, would be standardized, a benchmark against which all drivers would be measured. And so, the death toll would begin to fall, a slow but inexorable decline into the abyss of safety.\n\nThis is no novel idea, merely a recognition of the obvious, a truism that has been hiding in plain sight. The statistics scream of a need for change, a plea for the young to be protected from themselves. Let us heed this call, and legislate a safer road, a road where the young and the reckless are not consumed by their own momentum, but rather guided by the wisdom of experience and the steady hand of responsibility.",
            "In the musty depths of the Library of Congress, I stumbled upon a trove of early Edison films, their fragile reels whispering secrets of a bygone era. My gaze wandered to the trick films, a litany of fifteen from 1895 to 1901, each one a masterclass in deception. As I delved into their poetics, I found myself enthralled by the ways in which creative editing wove illusions. My exploration centered on the lasting influence of these trick films, particularly in the evolutionary outliers that dared to push the boundaries of the established forms.\n\nThe early trick films, bound by the shackles of their time, adhered to a strict framework: static cameras, frontal prosceniums, and a reliance on long and medium shots. The one shot, one film mantra, a strict adherence to the theatrical traditions that shaped the very fabric of these silent spectacles. Yet, as the century turned, a few bold innovators began to chip away at these conventions, introducing the forbidden fruit of multiple shots.\n\nA cursory glance at the trick films reveals a curious consistency: they are all born from the womb of the interior set, a frontal proscenium that frames the action, a stage set against which the players dance. The camera remains steadfast, a sentinel of the proscenium, refusing to yield to the siren's call of movement. This adherence to the theatre and vaudeville traditions resulted in a limitation: figures in these films moved only side to side, their paths a stilted waltz across the horizontal axis. Even as they disappeared from view, the camera remained fixed, a static witness to their vanishing acts.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style gave rise to a preponderance of long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups, those intimate whispers to the audience, were a rarity, a luxury not afforded to these early trick films. This adherence to the theatrical tradition, where the audience beheld the entire performance within the borders of the stage, rendered close-ups anathema. The actors, locked in their designated spaces, remained steadfast, their movements confined to the middle ground, never venturing forth to tempt the lens.\n\nMost trick films, bound by the shackles of their format, adhered to the dictum that one conceptual shot equaled a film. This strict adherence limited the length of these trick films to a minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of magic and wonder. Narrative and drama were secondary to the vaudeville-style tricks that populated these early films: magic, disappearing acts, and the switcheroo. Yet, upon closer inspection, one discovers that the apparent simplicity of these trick films belies a more complex reality. A single \"shot\" may conceal multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a prime example of this sleight of hand, its physical shot masked by the conceptual unity of the viewer's experience.",
            "In the sterile light of history, a figure emerged - John Taylor of Caroline. A man of unwavering conviction, his fervor for Republicanism burned like a fire in the desolate landscape of his time. His life's work, a testament to his unshakeable dedication to the agrarian way, left an indelible mark on the creases of American politics. Like a withered tree, his views on government, sovereignty, and the judicial system were rooted in the soil of his profession, their branches stretching towards the heavens in a futile attempt to defy the encroaching darkness.\n\nAs he traversed the barren expanse of American ideology, Taylor clutched to his chest the notion of an agrarian system, a beacon of hope in a world beset by the ravages of time. His arguments, a litany of defiant denunciations, raged against the tides of despotism, calling forth a world where the rights of man, like a parched traveler in a desert landscape, would be safeguarded from the predations of a government grown bloated and tyrannical.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Taylor would often whisper to himself the words of the Declaration of Independence, its phrases a sacred incantation that conjured forth a world where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were recognized, and a government was forged to temper the destructive tendencies of its citizens. Like a blacksmith shaping the molten metal of society, Taylor's vision sought to create a system where the virtues of private property, agriculture, and communal well-being were forged into a crucible of justice.\n\nA man of unyielding rigidity, Taylor's views on morality were a dichotomy, a stark contrast between the light and the darkness. He saw the world as a dualistic tapestry, with the inherent good and evil of humanity forever intertwined. As he gazed out upon the desolate landscape, he cried out against the encroaching shadows, his words a battle cry against the forces of avarice and self-interest that threatened to consume all in their path.\n\nTaylor's battle cry, a clarion call to arms, was his advocacy for a strict construction of the Constitution, a bulwark against the encroaching tide of Federal power. Like a sentinel guarding the gates of freedom, he warned against the dangers of a government grown too large, too powerful, too consumed by its own ambition. And yet, he knew that a simple, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a double-edged sword, capable of cutting both ways, depending on the intentions of its wielder.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, a shining beacon of hope in a world gone mad. Like a ghostly apparition, Taylor's spirit still haunts the landscape of American politics, a reminder of a time when the ideals of freedom and self-government were not mere abstractions, but living, breathing realities that shaped the course of history.",
            "The numbers fell like autumn leaves from the trees, plummeting in the third month of the project. It was a sight that cut deep, a decline that seemed without reason or respite. As the snows crept in like a thief in the night, it was said that fewer hands were able to reach for their bicycles or their feet to carry them to work. Perhaps this was the explanation. Perhaps it was the weight of the semester's end, when the minds were elsewhere and the body's labors were forgotten. The holidays, with their long and listless breath, had descended upon the world, a season of forgetfulness and of quiet. And yet, none of these things could account for the cold, dark silence of February. It was as if the project's spark had been extinguished, leaving naught but embers to smolder in the darkness.\n\nIt was as if the initial fervor had worn thin, like a threadbare coat worn to the bone. The Carpool Challenge Week, a last-ditch effort to rekindle the flame, had brought a fleeting spark, but it was a spark that flickered and died. The challenge of maintaining momentum had proven a Sisyphean task, a weight that pressed upon the shoulders of all who toiled to keep the project alive.\n\nAnd then there was the ingrained desire, a primal urge, to be free and unencumbered, to ride the open road with the wind in one's hair. It was a freedom that had been lost, a liberty that had been sacrificed upon the altar of convenience and of habit. And so, the prizes, once a beacon of hope, now seemed paltry and weak, insufficient to stir the hearts of those who had grown complacent in their ways.\n\nPerhaps, it was said, that had we offered greater rewards, prizes of greater value and allure, the numbers might have risen, the enthusiasm might have been rekindled. A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car – these were prizes that would have spoken to the hearts of those who had grown numb to the project's call. But alas, it was too late, the damage had been done, and the numbers had fallen, a precipitous drop that seemed to mark the end of all hope.",
            "In the vast expanse of the market, a peculiar entity roams, shrouded in mystery, yet possessing a certain allure. This is the ETF, a creature of the modern era, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, yet imbued with the flexibility of a lone stock. Like a chameleon, it can blend seamlessly into the landscape, offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share with ease. Its expense ratios, a mere whisper compared to the average mutual fund, beckon the savvy investor like a siren's call.\n\nYet, like any creature of the wild, the ETF has its predators and pitfalls. The commissions that must be paid for each trade, a toll exacted by the market, can be a heavy burden. The wide variety of funds available, a veritable feast for the investor, can also be a curse, for in the midst of plenty, lies the danger of confusion and misdirection.\n\nFor the purposes of this inquiry, we shall focus on the ETF IHF, a creature of peculiar fascination, and examine its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of its assets. Like a zoologist studying the habits of a rare beast, we shall delve into the characteristics of these holdings, seeking to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF can match the rewards of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it.\n\nTo avoid the tedium of an exhaustive examination, we shall confine our attention to the top 10 holdings, a select group that holds the key to understanding the ETF's secrets. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised solely of these 10 stocks, in the proportions established by the ETF.\n\nThe chart that follows reveals a striking truth: the return of a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings surpasses that of the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a finding that suggests a potentially more stable and profitable configuration.\n\nHowever, the question remains: are these results statistically significant, or merely a product of chance? To answer this, we must examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF. Only by subjecting these creatures of the market to the crucible of statistical analysis can we uncover the truth about their strengths and weaknesses.",
            "In the hushed silences between the pages of his works, a whispered truth surfaces - Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his own nocturnal wanderings. The term \"Thulé\", a word he uses with eerie frequency, originates from the obscure recesses of Virgil's legacy. The Roman poet once employed it to describe a distant isle beyond the northwestern horizon, a place where the known world dwindled to a faint outline.\n\nPoe's fascination with the Germanic tradition cannot be overstated. His affinity for the lyrical cadences of Goethe's verse is a well-documented fact, one that Karl J. Arndt astutely noted in his analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\". The parallelisms between their works suggest a deep reverence for the German master's craft. \n\nA closer examination of Goethe's \"Faust\" reveals a poem within the poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting elegy that speaks to the desolate landscape of loss. The king, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the abyss of his grief, his life force ebbing away like the tide. This somber tale mirrors the melancholy of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker finds himself adrift in a world drained of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" as a refrain, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the edges of his poem, bespeaks a deep fascination with Goethe's work. The fact that Goethe's \"Faust\" was translated into English in 1842, mere months before Poe's own reference to \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", only serves to underscore the connection between the two writers.\n\nPoe's oeuvre is replete with allusions to the German master, a testament to the profound impact Goethe's work had on his own creative vision. His admiration for Tennyson, another English poet, only serves to underscore the breadth of his literary influences. The whispered echoes of Goethe's verse, lingering in the shadows of Poe's works, remind us that the boundaries between art and influence are often blurred, and that the creative impulse can be a labyrinthine path of echoes and reflections.",
            "In the sterile halls of jurisprudence, a question forms, like a slow-burning ember, consuming all in its path. Could a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages in the aftermath of a calamitous slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store? The store manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, and yet he chose to ignore it, engrossed in the fleeting pleasure of his dinner. It is a scenario that bespeaks a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nA judge, wise and detached, would likely deny a motion for summary dismissal of Palmer's claim. To prove that an award of punitive damages is warranted, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction. Furthermore, she must show that Martin's conduct was despicable, a word that conjures images of a soulless, heartless entity, devoid of empathy or compassion. It is a high bar, but one that Palmer may clear, given the evidence of Martin's negligence.\n\nIn the months preceding Palmer's accident, six customers had been injured in slip-and-fall incidents in the same store. These incidents should have served as a clarion warning to Martin, a red flag that signaled a grave and imminent danger. And yet, he chose to ignore it, prioritizing his own convenience over the safety of his patrons. This is no mere oversight; it is a deliberate choice, a conscious decision to put profits above people.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, dismissed the warning, citing his dinner break as an excuse. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference. And it was then, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury.\n\nThe evidence mounts against Martin, a mountain of negligence and malice. Palmer's case is not merely one of carelessness; it is a testament to the systemic failures that allowed a preventable tragedy to occur. The question now is not whether Palmer will prevail, but whether the court will mete out justice, and restore some semblance of balance to a world gone awry.\n\nIn California, the law is clear: punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, in this context, is not merely a fleeting thought; it is a state of mind, a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The law demands a willful and deliberate disregard, a callous indifference to the consequences of one's actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's actions meet the test. He was aware of the probable consequences of his inaction, and yet he chose to ignore them, prioritizing his own interests over the well-being of his customers. This is malice, pure and simple. It is a recklessness that defies comprehension, a callous disregard for the safety of those who trusted him to protect them.\n\nIn the end, it is not merely a question of whether Palmer will win, but whether justice will be served. Will the court recognize the gravity of Martin's actions, and hold him accountable for his negligence? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the law demands justice, and justice demands accountability.",
            "Four winters past I found myself ensnared in the labyrinth of a course on the tenets of Islam at the CBC.  Amidst the fervent debates that raged within the classroom, one question emerged as a behemoth of contention: was Islam a religion born of hostility or of peace?  In the aftermath of that fateful year, 2001, the media's gaze upon Islam had shifted from a withering scorn to an unyielding tolerance.  It was as if the very notion of a presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, whose lineage bore the unmistakable mark of Islam, was an affront to the values of the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, for it stands as a paradox, a tale of contradiction.  The man who was said to have been driven by conviction, who was said to have subdued the tribes through conquest and coercion, now emerges as a martyr, a man of humility and compassion.  His was a story of a man who was misunderstood, who was willing to bend and yield to the will of others, and yet, it was in this very humility that people found the truth, and one by one, they sought him out.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad are striking, and it is this similarity that has long troubled me.  The tale of multiplying mutton and milk, so that there was more than enough for forty men, is a testament to the writer's deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a man of truth, a man who did not need to prove himself, but rather, who lived in the very essence of the divine.  This is a deception, a subtle but insidious lie, for it diminishes the miracle of Jesus Christ, and seeks to co-opt his essence, his very being, for the benefit of another.\n\nMoreover, the stories within the biography seem designed to prove the existence of witnesses, to provide a veritable proof of the truth of the tales.  But these stories, born of third-hand accounts, lack the authenticity that only first-hand testimony can provide.  They are a testimony to the writer's desire to prove the truth, but in doing so, they only serve to erode the credibility of the narrative.\n\nIt is this very exaltation of Muhammad, this portrayal of him as a godly man, a man of humility and compassion, that troubles me the most.  History, however, stands as a stark refutation of this image, and I am left to wonder if the true story of Muhammad's rise to power is one that is known to his followers today.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, once a flame that flickered bright, soon left behind a smoldering ember in the development of Christian thought.  Like a flame that guttered in the darkness, the original intent of Jesus' message was lost in the vast expanse of history.  We see this trend stretched out before us like a desolate landscape, a path that wandered farther and farther from its origin.  The world, now, is a place where awareness stirs, a progressive tide that seeks to reclaim the lost truth.  Yet, traditional minds, like the stubborn roots of an ancient tree, cling to the familiar, resisting any notion that would upend what they have been taught.  They may not be a dominant force, but their presence will be felt, a steady heartbeat that slows the march of progress.\n\nIn time, however, a yearning will grow, a desire to strip away the accretions that have accumulated over the centuries, to reveal the pure, unadulterated essence of the faith.  It will take patience, like the slow burning of a fire that reduces wood to ash, but the outcome is inevitable:  The clock of Christian history will turn backward, and the faithful will be led, like a flock of birds returning to their nesting grounds, back to the original intent of the name that bears its mantle.  One by one, the layers of doctrine will be shed, until only the pure, unvarnished message of Jesus remains, unencumbered by the claims of those who would seek to claim the mantle of his authority.  When this reversal takes hold, sweeping through the United States and Europe like a winter's storm, the church will be transformed, its institution remaining strong, but its theology stripped bare, revealing the simple, unadorned truth of the faith.\n\nThis great reversion is not without precedent.  We see it in the past, like a recurring pattern in the natural world.  Christians, once persecuted and shunned, became the dominant force in the Roman Empire.  Our nation, too, has undergone a similar transformation, emerging from the darkness of slavery to the light of leadership.  The great reversion that is coming will be no different, a story of undoing, of stripping away the accretions of history to reveal the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that has come to characterize the Christian faith.\n\nIt is a crucial distinction that will mark this process:  The words of Jesus will be seen not as literal commands, but as metaphors, their meaning hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.  So what lies beneath the surface of history, waiting to be rediscovered?  We find, at the foundation of the Christian faith, the soil of Judaism, the theology that gave rise to the Christian faith.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, these were the building blocks of the faith, even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  But the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "He believed that the darkness within, the abyss that gnawed at the heart of humanity, was a void of boundless avarice and self-absorption. A chasm that yawned open, revealing a world where the only currency was the advancement of one's own interests, and the well-being of others was but a distant, fading echo. The Jungle laid bare this grotesque spectacle, a gaudy carnival of greed where the owners and managers of the great factories danced with abandon, their eyes fixed on the prize, their souls lost to the abyss.\n\nTheir god was profit, their scripture the bottom line. They cared not for the suffering that their machinations wrought, nor for the lives that were crushed beneath their heel. The smoke that belched from their chimneys was a manifestation of their malevolent disregard, a noxious cloud that shrouded the world, obscuring all that was good and pure. The pens that held the animals, the rivers that ran thick with waste, all were but mere trinkets in the grand game of progress.\n\nTheir employees, mere pawns in this grand scheme, toiled in darkness, their lives a Sisyphean struggle to eke out a meager existence. The hours were long, the labor grueling, and the compensation a paltry handful of coins. And when the whim of the owners struck, the workers were cast aside like so much rubbish, left to fend for themselves in a world that offered little solace. No laws, no regulations, no safety net to catch the falling. Only the cold, unforgiving hand of fate, and the pitiless hearts of those who held the reins.\n\nThe unions, those supposed saviors, were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, preying on the very people they claimed to protect. They feasted on the blood of the workers, leaving them to suffer in the darkness, their cries for help drowned out by the cacophony of greed. And so the workers toiled, their lives but a mere existence, their souls crushed by the weight of their own desperation.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, immorality reigned supreme, a cancer that ate away at the very fabric of society. The Jungle presented a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the voiceless were silenced, and the downtrodden were trampled beneath the feet of the privileged. A world where the only truth was that of the bottom line, and the only morality was that of the dollar.\n\nBut amidst this desolate wasteland, a glimmer of hope flickered, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. For in the darkness, there lay a spark, a flame that burned bright with the promise of resistance, of rebellion, of a better tomorrow. A spark that would one day ignite, casting a fiery glow over the abyss, and illuminating the path to a brighter, more just world.",
            "In the crucible of literature, authors forges the metal of meaning, tempering it with technique, that they might imbue their words with a certain cadence, a certain weight. Some of these techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of manipulation, wields a multitude of these methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He pairs unlikely bedfellows - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an aura around a subject, an exercise in alchemy. Other times, he assigns significance to symbols, only to later reap the benefits of that symbolism. Colors, in particular, prove a fertile ground for Fitzgerald's machinations. He sows the seeds of meaning for certain hues - white/gray and red/pink - and later reaps the harvest of association.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald cultivates a specific connotation for white/gray, a dichotomy that speaks to the very fabric of his narrative. White, in his schema, is a color of elegance, of refinement, of privilege. Gray, on the other hand, is a hue of weariness, of age, of decay. This distinction is first sown in the early pages of the novel, where the use of these colors is as ubiquitous as the ash that chokes the valley of ashes. Daisy and Jordan are forever \"in white,\" their porcelain skin a testament to their social standing. Even the narrator, Nick, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's grand soiree, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when he encounters Myrtle, a woman as faded as the color itself.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by applying these colors to the most mundane of subjects. The streets of New York, for instance, are a \"white chasm,\" a seemingly endless expanse of concrete and steel. Even the names of people at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder that even the elite are bound by the fetters of conformity. The apartment houses, a \"long white cake,\" are a uniform sprawl of sameness, a testament to the crushing homogeneity of modern life.\n\nHowever, it is not until Fitzgerald has sown this meaning that he reap the benefits of his labor. He uses white/gray to signify the unimportance, the uniformity of certain subjects. Daisy, once a vibrant presence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a \"uniform addition\" to Gatsby's world. Her \"white dress\" is a hollow shell of elegance, a reminder of the emptiness at the heart of her character. Even her fur collar is shrouded in a \"gray haze,\" a symbol of the decay that lies beneath her polished surface.\n\nIn the end, Fitzgerald's use of color is a testament to the power of symbolism in literature. By imbuing certain hues with meaning, he creates a rich tapestry of association, a world where the colors of the palette are alive with significance. It is a technique that has captivated readers for generations, a reminder that, in the words of the great author himself, \"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"",
            "The land of San Diego County - a place of plenty, where the sun beats down upon the earth like a hammer upon an anvil. The crops that grow here are a testament to the fertility of the soil and the bounty of the heavens. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with juice and flavor. Citrus fruits hang heavy on the branches, their peels a deep gold in the sunlight. Leafy greens and squash and broccoli and herbs push up through the earth, a verdant carpet that blankets the land. And the tree fruits - peaches and lemons and berries - they grow in profusion, a cornucopia of sweetness and flavor.\n\nIn this land of plenty, there is a growing demand for the kind of food that is grown without the aid of chemicals. Organic community supported agriculture is a thriving enterprise, with many organizations in the San Diego area clamoring for a spot in their programs. The waiting lists are long, a testament to the desire for a cleaner, healthier way of eating. And it is not just the food that is organic - the farms themselves are a draw, with many offering tours and access to hiking and birdwatching trails.\n\nBut the road to success is not an easy one. The landowner must be prepared to put in the work - to till the soil, to plant and harvest, to remove pests and weeds without resorting to chemicals. It is a labor-intensive process, one that requires a deep understanding of the land and its rhythms. And the costs can be high, especially when compared to the large-scale operations that dominate the agricultural landscape. The small organic farm must be efficient, must be able to compete with the big boys on price while also providing a superior product.\n\nAnd yet, there is a reward for this hard work, a reward that goes beyond the profit and loss ledgers. The land, once a barren and lifeless expanse, is transformed into a thriving ecosystem, teeming with life and color. The plants and animals that call this land home are a testament to the power of this way of farming, a way that seeks to work in harmony with nature rather than against it.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This land has a long and storied history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was once part of an original homestead patent, and it is likely that it was used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nToday, this land presents a unique opportunity for a small farmer to create a thriving organic farm, one that not only provides a superior product but also preserves the natural beauty of the area. With the right guidance and support, the landowner could create a model of sustainable agriculture that benefits both the land and the community.\n\nI chose this piece of property from a real estate website and researched the available government programs that a small farmer might use to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. A model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area, one that demonstrates the potential for success in this endeavor.",
            "The chasm between cultures is as vast as the distances that separate us. And yet it's not a chasm of definable edges, but rather a tapestry woven of contrasting threads. A culture is not a singular entity, but rather a multitude of disparate voices that whisper stories of what it is not, as much as what it is. It's a complex weave of the oft-invisible, the unspoken, and the unseen. To attempt to reduce it to broad strokes - \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - is to misunderstand the very essence of its intricacies.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of a foreign culture, one must first grasp the nuances that lie within. It's a journey that begins with the study of its history, the probing of its prejudices, and the recognition of its inherent contradictions. Rather than trying to alter or judge, one must accept it for what it is, a living, breathing entity that defies simplification. In the crucible of negotiation, this acceptance is a virtue, especially when one finds himself at a disadvantage.\n\nBut culture's reach extends far beyond national borders. It seeps into the very marrow of corporate life, manifesting in the dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices of individual companies. A company's culture can be as varied as its employees, with some institutions valuing long hours, while others prioritize flexibility. The evidence of this cultural tapestry is woven into the fabric of everyday life, a reminder that even within the same nation, diversity thrives.\n\nValues, the unseen threads that give culture its strength, are the key to understanding its very essence. If saving face or communal harmony are the guiding principles, a negotiator will think twice before publicly airing his company's dirty laundry. Conversely, a culture that prizes a hard-driven bargain will not be swayed by the promise of a quick resolution. To grasp these subtleties is to grasp the delicate balance of power at the negotiating table.\n\nBut to truly navigate the complexities of a foreign culture, one must also seek to understand the individual who sits across from him. To grasp the personal stories, the motivations, and the desires that drive them. In this, lies the key to effective negotiation, a delicate dance of understanding and empathy that can bridge even the widest of cultural chasms.",
            "Though the fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,' the silence of his words is a hollow echo that rings through the desolate landscape of the soul. This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two venerable thinkers, St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas. Their words, like the faint whispers of a distant wind, seek to convince us of the existence of a divine presence, a being both elusive and all-encompassing.\n\nTo compare these two thinkers, we must first acknowledge that their arguments are a testament to the enduring power of faith. We shall proceed under the assumption that their contemplations are in defense of the God of the Bible, lest we risk comparing apples and oranges in the wilderness of theological debate.\n\nAnselm's path to understanding is a winding road that leads inward, to the recesses of the human heart. He proposes that the existence of God is not something to be discovered in the external world, but rather in the depths of our own understanding. The proof of God's existence lies within the confines of our own mind, a truth that can be intuited by the faithful without the need for empirical evidence. This is a notion that echoes the quiet whispers of the soul, a testament to the power of faith in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more cerebral approach, one that seeks to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical observation. His five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – weave a intricate tapestry of logic that seeks to persuade the doubter with the cold, hard light of reason. Like a master weaver, Aquinas threads together the disparate strands of human experience, creating a fabric of proof that is both convincing and unyielding.\n\nYet, as we examine these arguments, we are left with the nagging sense that neither thinker has provided a comprehensive basis for their beliefs. Their words, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, seem to whisper a truth that is both profound and elusive. In the end, our understanding of God remains a mystery, a labyrinthine path that winds its way through the chambers of the heart.\n\nThus, we are left to ponder the words of the fool, who hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' And we are left to wonder, in the silence of our own hearts, whether the existence of this being is a truth that can be proven, or a faith that must be felt.",
            "In an age long past, before the darkness that had fallen, a prince was born, destined to become the Buddha. His path unwound like a thread through the tapestry of time, from the world's grasp to the stillness of enlightenment. The teachings that flowed from his lips like a river, shaping the contours of a faith that would come to be known as Buddhism. \n\nBut time, that great solvent, had its way with the teachings, eroding the edges, smoothing the rough places. The Theravada sect, a living thing, breathed and adapted, its core unchanged yet its shape shifting to suit the vicissitudes of the world. In the land of Sri Lanka, the water-cutting ceremony unfolded, a pageant of devotion, a testament to the adaptability of the human heart.\n\nMonks and laymen, bound by a shared purpose, participated in this ritual, a tradition that bore no direct link to the Buddha's own words. The fringes of the faith, from the most superficial displays to the very essence of its soteriology, had been reshaped by the forces that buffeted it - the hostile and the benign, the internal and the external.\n\nAs we proceed, certain terms will recur, like the echoes of a distant drumbeat. We speak of internal and external forces, the former born of the Buddha's followers, the latter from outsiders. A hostile force is one that would do harm, that seeks to rend the fabric of the community. A benign force, on the other hand, brings no intention to harm, though its consequences may be far-reaching.\n\nThe core of Theravada Buddhism - the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha - remains steadfast. Refuge lies in this trio, the Buddha, a being of wisdom and compassion; the Dhamma, a body of teachings that seek to illuminate the path; and the Sangha, a community bound by a shared quest for understanding.\n\nAt the heart of the Dhamma lie the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture - the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Concepts like Anatta - the absence of a soul - and Anicca - the impermanence of all things - hold sway, beckoning the follower towards the stillness of the end of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for living, five precepts for the laity, many more for the monastic order. And at the very heart of the teachings lies the Four Noble Truths: that suffering is inherent in life, that attachment brings suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the shadow of time, the twin behemoths of the United States and Mexico stood, their rivalry a festering wound that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. It was a grudging truce between two nations, a ceaseless dance of bitterness and distrust that sprang from the marrow of their shared history. The conflict reached its zenith in the brutal crucible of the Mexican-American War, where the United States, like a behemoth awakened from slumber, crushed its southern neighbor, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. The echoes of that war still lingered, a miasma of resentment that seeped into the marrow of their shared blood.\n\nThis was not an isolated anomaly, for it is in the nature of nations to clash, their borders a razor's edge between rivalries and disputes. The United States and Mexico were not alone in their animosity, their shared border a catalyst for the simmering embers of discord. David M. Pletcher's words echoed through the ages: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations, their shared geography a constant reminder of their entwined fates, only served to fan the flames of their rivalry.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute lay the festering wound of religious differences, a chasm that yawned between the two nations like a great abyss. Sally Frahm's words spoke to the very soul of this divide: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was as if the two nations were locked in an eternal struggle, their ideologies clashing like titans, each side convinced that its own way was the only path to salvation. And yet, this was not merely a matter of politics, but of faith, a deeply ingrained distrust that seeped from the very foundations of their history.\n\nThe distrust between the English and Spanish, those distant forebears, had left an indelible mark on the nations that succeeded them. The United States and Mexico, inheriting this legacy of animosity, stumbled through the early years of their relationship, their steps faltering as they navigated the treacherous waters of their shared past. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes between 1836 and 1893 stood as a testament to the depth of their enmity (2000, p. 145). It was a litany of territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier problems, each confrontation a reminder of the festering wound that lay between them.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the United States and Mexico began to realize that their interests were not mutually exclusive. Schmitt's words spoke to the turning point in their relationship: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109). And with this dependence came a shift in the dynamics of their rivalry, as the United States' ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). It was a slow-burning fuse, but one that would eventually lead to the end of their long and bloody rivalry.",
            "It was a slow unraveling, the threads of my life fraying like the tattered edges of a worn quilt. Fifteen years past, a sudden and inexplicable darkness took hold, a sickness that consumed me whole. I was a nurse then, one who had chosen that path for the promise of security it offered, a refuge from the uncertainties of my own childhood. The words of my elders still echoed in my mind, \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I put aside my dreams, my desires to be a scientist, to be a journalist, and I dedicated myself to the noble work of caring for others.\n\nBut now, as I sit here, my body worn down, my prospects diminished, I am left with nothing but the faint memories of a life once lived. Fifteen years of living on the precipice, clinging to the fragile thread of Social Security Disability, I am a shell of the person I once was. Every day is a battle, a fight for survival, for security, for self-respect. And yet, amidst this abyss, there is one truth that haunts me still. I could not have endured without the kindness of strangers, the selfless acts of those who saw beyond my frailty and reached out to help.\n\nIt is a lesson that has stayed with me, a truth that I cling to in the dark hours of the night. In the face of disaster, we are never alone. We are sustained by the love and compassion of those around us. And so I urge you, do not place all your trust in the crumbling edifice of government. Learn to trust one another, to rely on the kindness of strangers, to ask for help without shame.\n\nFor it was not the rugged individualism of our forebears that sustained them through the hard times, but the very fabric of community, the threads of compassion and mutual respect that bound them together. The pioneers who crossed the vast expanse of the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but together, as a family, as a community.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have done so, gathering the meager tools of survival: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and the faint promise of a life beyond the ashes. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and waterproof matches, canned goods and the whispered hope of a brighter day. But even these meager supplies would mean little without the knowledge of those who would stand by my side, who would offer a helping hand in the face of disaster.\n\nAnd so, I urge you, do not forget the value of community, of kindness, of compassion. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will sustain us, but the love and support of those who stand with us, shoulder to shoulder, in the face of the unknown.",
            "In the depths of existence, a question lingers, a query that gnaws at the very fabric of life: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, like unseen currents in a river, that shape the course of their transformation? Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, dared not attempt to define the simplest of organic forms in mathematical terms. Yet, as the years pass, the pursuit of understanding the intricate dance of evolution continues. Recently, the tools of mathematical modeling have been applied to the mysteries of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the paths of ontogeny and phylogeny like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind (Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur own inquiry delves into the realm of the Prunum, seeking to unravel the threads of evolutionary-developmental change through the marriage of mathematical modeling and experimental study. We have employed X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters of Prunum species, which we then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). The resulting models have allowed us to envision hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, casting a light on the boundaries of possible change in this enigmatic clade.\n\nA shell, that most mysterious of structures, can be seen as a tube traversing the expanse of time, its path marked by the revolutions of the whorls. These whorls, like the pages of a book, spiral around an unseen axis, the columella, a central column that gives the shell its form and function. The speed at which the whorls expand can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, the body whorl, while the spire is composed of all the whorls that precede it. The apex, the tip of the spire, and the base, the opposite end, form the extremities of this intricate, coiled structure.\n\nA shell can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the most common orientation. By counting the whorls, we can unravel the secrets of a shell's growth, beginning with the first suture and dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that allows us to chart the path of the aperture as it travels through time and space, carried by the animal's growth.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, a testament to the power of science to illuminate the unknown. By formulating a mathematical model, we can manipulate the variables, varying the parameters of skeletogenesis and exploring the boundaries of possible forms. And so, we continue to explore, driven by the question that has haunted us since the dawn of time: what lies at the heart of evolution, and how do we unlock its secrets?",
            "In the desolate expanse of Indonesia's recent past, the specter of mortality casts a long and unyielding shadow. For a decade, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has hovered, a steadfast sentinel of a nation's unyielding struggle. Like a withered tree, its branches reaching for a sky shrouded in uncertainty, the country's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals falters, its leaves rustling with the whispers of unfulfilled promises. The echoes of a failing healthcare system reverberate, a haunting reminder that the lifeblood of a nation's future hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe statistics tell a tale of woe, a litany of unmet targets and unfulfilled expectations. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled health worker in attendance, yet the presence of traditional healers, with their limited capacity to intervene in the face of complications, belies the very notion of progress. The maternal death toll, a statistic as unforgiving as the earth itself, remains a stark testament to the system's inadequacies. The percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has dwindled, a steady decline in a country where the very fabric of healthcare appears to be unraveling.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate languishes at a paltry four percent, an indicator of the crippling inequities that beset the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Urban areas, the fabled oases of modernity, boast a rate of seven percent, while rural areas, those forgotten bastions of antiquity, struggle to muster a mere two percent. The chasm between the haves and have-nots, a divide as deep as the Grand Canyon itself, gapes wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that threaten to consume the very heart of the nation's healthcare.\n\nAs the country hurtles toward the precipice of uncertainty, the question looms: how to address the yawning chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots? Should Indonesia chart a path of programmatic interventions, a series of targeted solutions designed to tackle specific ills, or should it focus on strengthening the overall healthcare system, a more holistic approach that seeks to address the very foundations of the problem? The answer, much like the future itself, remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nProgrammatic approaches, those siren songs of quick fixes and fast results, beckon with their promise of swift and tangible progress. Yet, like the sirens of old, they come with a warning: the lure of funding and resources, a Pied Piper's call that draws human capital away from other, equally pressing needs. The duplication of services, a cacophony of competing programs, threatens to drown out the very voices of those in need. In this desolate landscape, the question hangs, a specter of a nation's future, poised on the precipice of uncertainty, waiting for the answer that will determine its very course.",
            "The Victorian novels, those labyrinthine tapestries of detail and aristocratic intrigue, often dwindle to mere shadows of their former selves when one encounters the aberrant threads of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like wayward travelers, strayed from the beaten path, embracing the mystique of the unknown and the bizarre, thus imbuing their characters with a depth that would otherwise have remained hidden. It is in the realm of the unexplained, the inexplicable, that their true essence resides, a realm where the fabric of reality is rent asunder, revealing the jagged contours of their inner lives.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the treacherous landscape of his existence, the boundaries between reality and madness become increasingly tenuous. The cacophony of sounds, the kaleidoscope of images, and the bedlam of emotions that assail him are akin to a maelstrom, pulling him under, sweeping him away on a tide of pain and despair. His mind, a maelstrom of conflicting thoughts and emotions, is beset on all sides by the tumultuous visions of Sikes and Crackit, their angry disputations echoing in his mind like a refrain. And yet, even as he struggles to maintain a tenuous grip on reality, the unseen forces that govern his life seem to mock him, leaving him with a sense of powerlessness, a feeling that he is but a pawn in a game he cannot control.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, Oliver's inner world is revealed, a world of pain and fear, of helplessness and despair. His hallucinations, those dreamlike states that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, serve as a window into his soul, a soul battered and bruised, yet still clinging to the hope of a better life. And it is in these moments of vulnerability that we see the true extent of his defeat, the extent to which he has been broken, his will shattered by the cruel hand of fate.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, where time itself seems to have lost all meaning, the day passes, a fleeting moment, a brief, desperate gasp for air in the void. The silence is oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocates, and the hours seem to stretch out before him like a gauntlet, each one a challenge, a reminder of the long, difficult road that lies ahead.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the mystery is woven into the very fabric of the narrative, a thread that runs through the heart of the story, a story of love and loss, of passion and decay. The dreamlike states that pervade the novel serve as a reminder of the fragility of the human psyche, the way in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy can become blurred, and the ease with which the mind can be led astray.\n\nThus, these two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand apart from the rest, their aberrant threads of mystery and the bizarre weaving a tapestry of depth and complexity, a tapestry that rewards close attention, a tapestry that reveals the hidden contours of the human heart.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of memory, the echoes of a long-forgotten time linger, a time when the outlines of a boy's struggle with the English tongue were etched upon my mind like a fresco on a crumbling wall. He was a child of Latino descent, a boy named Adrian, and his troubles with reading seemed a riddle wrapped in an enigma, a cipher that refused to yield its secrets. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others lay still, mute and unresponsive, a language that seemed to defy comprehension.\n\nI was drawn into this mystery, a tutor in the after-school program, tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of his struggles. And it was there, in that fragile nexus of language and learning, that the truth began to reveal itself, like a slow-burning ember glowing to life in the dark. It was not that he couldn't read, but rather that he didn't know the English alphabet, its shapes and sounds a mystery to him, a language that lay beyond his grasp.\n\nThe revelation struck me like a blow, a sudden and profound understanding of the obstacles that lay before him. And in that moment, I knew that I had stumbled upon a truth that would haunt me forever, a truth that would echo in the chambers of my mind like a refrain, a reminder of the fragility of language and the power of understanding.\n\nThe problem of the language barrier in schools, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children, Adrian's story is a testament to its complexity, a reminder that even in the most unlikely of places, a solution can be found. It is a story of the power of compassion, of the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles.\n\nBut what of the many children who struggle with the English language, children who speak it imperfectly, who stumble over its rhythms and cadences? What of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that seem to offer a panacea, a magic bullet that can cure the affliction of language? The dual language system, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a shining example of the power of bilingualism. But it is not a panacea, a silver bullet that can be fired from a distance, a solution that can be applied with ease.\n\nNo, the key lies in the combination, a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding. It lies in the special aids, the tutors, the bilingual educators who can guide the way, who can navigate the treacherous waters of language and learning. It lies in the recognition that language is not a barrier, but a bridge, a connection to the world beyond, a world of possibilities and promise.\n\nAnd so, I speak of Adrian's story, a story of struggle and triumph, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles. I speak of the language barrier, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children. And I speak of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that require a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own limitations, our own inability to see beyond the horizon, to comprehend the complexity of the world around us. It is our own fear, our own reluctance to adapt, to change. But it is also our own capacity for compassion, for understanding, for empathy. It is our own capacity to see the world through the eyes of another, to hear the whispers of a language that lies beyond our own.\n\nAnd so, let us not be afraid, let us not be hesitant. Let us not be bound by our own limitations, our own fears. Let us instead be open, let us be willing to listen, to learn, to understand. For in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own refusal to see the world in all its complexity, in all its beauty.",
            "In the earliest years of our lives, a notion is sown within us that there is something beyond our mortal grasp. A force, a presence, a power that our small minds struggle to comprehend. Some are led to the hallowed halls of Sunday school, others to the sacred precincts of Temple, while still others search inward for answers that may elude them forever. Many cling to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, while others reject them outright, choosing instead to chart their own course in the dark expanse of existence. The path we choose is a labyrinthine one, winding through the shadows and into the uncertain light of our own perspectives on the divine.\n\nThe evening rain drummed upon the tin roof, a relentless cadence that echoed the turmoil in my heart. My father sat beside me, his eyes lost in the downpour, his gaze a mixture of remembrance and longing. He had grown gaunt, his frame gaunt as the trees that stood skeletal in the winter's grasp. His hair, once a luxuriant mane, now thinned and wisped, like the last wisps of smoke from a dying ember. I felt a shroud of sorrow settle over me, a weight that seemed to crush the air from my lungs. I reached out, my arms encircling him, seeking solace in the warmth of his flesh. We sat together, two figures lost in the rain's melancholy rhythm, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, a bereavement that fell like a dark shroud upon my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, a cruel jest that seemed to mock the very fabric of our existence. I couldn't help but wonder: what manner of God would permit such a fate? I stood alone in the night, my words lost in the void, my thoughts a jumble of anger and despair. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life, the moment when the spark that had animated him for so long was extinguished. I wanted to remember the man he was, not the withered shell that remained. My father would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his mortality, to watch as the life that had given me being slipped away into the darkness. I curled into a ball, a fragile, vulnerable thing, and waited for the news that would shatter my world.\n\nBut the silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that smothered me whole. No one called. No one came. I was left to my own devices, lost in a sea of grief, my heart a heavy stone that dragged me down into the depths of despair.",
            "In the grim tableau of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as an enigmatic monolith, a contradictory union of the antique and the modern. As Ian Watt astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this confounding genre embodies the paradox of 'Old-New'. Critics have long disparaged its supposed vacuity, yet extolled its capacity to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto forged the proto-Gothic mode by combining the antiquated theatricality of the past with the novel's nascent innovations. Walpole dubbed this novelistic marriage 'A Gothic Story', a term that encapsulates the union of the 'old' and the 'new' (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre, with its penchant for medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, stands as a testament to the transience of time. Even in Walpole's era, the term 'Gothic' was a catch-all for disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, bespeaking a bygone era deemed antiquated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. Yet, it is this very synthesis of the theatrical and the novelistic that has allowed the Gothic to endure, to become at once anachronistic and rejuvenated for readers disconnected from its original context.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic lies the concept of Chivalry, an idealized paradigm of the medieval knight, representing honor, valor, and competence. This chivalric ethos, embodied in characters like Frederic, serves as a foil to the perceived moral decay of the present. Walpole, writing in a period of turmoil, likely saw in the Gothic era a lost innocence, a morality he felt was absent in the society of his time. His novel, therefore, becomes a lament for a bygone era, one in which chivalry and honor reigned supreme. Frederic, with his noble lineage, sufferings, and supposed martyrdom, exemplifies the chivalric ideal, albeit with an excess that foreshadows the Gothic trope of hyperbole.\n\nIn the labyrinthine corridors of literary history, the Gothic novel remains an enigma, a genre that resists easy categorization. Its marriage of the antique and the modern has allowed it to transcend time, speaking to readers across the ages with a haunting, timeless elegance.",
            "The winding course of goods through the void of the marketplace is a labyrinth of steps, a procession of processes that bend and twist to deliver the desired object to the supplicant's hand. In the dark of 1982, a figure known as Keith Oliver stumbled upon the term that would give shape to this unseen path: supply chain management. A vagabond of industry, Oliver revealed the hidden contours of the supply chain, a terra incognita that wound from the customer's plea to the raw materials, the production, the storage, and the distribution of products to the customer's door. \n\nSix beacons mark the way through this desolate land: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The navigator of the supply chain, the manager, must chart a course through these elements to chart a course for the customer's satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire enterprise is built. It is here that the manager must divine the will of the market, that vast and unknowable force that dictates the customer's demands. Like a sage divining the future from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, the manager must interpret the signs and portents of the market, that they might produce the goods that the customer desires. And once the manager has grasped the customer's needs, they must decide how to meet them, where to produce the goods, and at what scale. The choices are many, and the consequences of error are dire, for every defect, every delay, every misstep can cascade through the chain like a stone cast into a still pond, sending ripples of cost and chaos through the entire system.\n\nSupply, the second element of the supply chain, is the strategic decisions that guide the manager's hand as they navigate the treacherous waters of production. It is here that they must decide which divisions of the company will produce which goods, and whether to outsource to other companies in the pursuit of velocity, that elusive goal of speed, quality, and low cost. The manager must be a master of the unseen, able to thread the needle of efficiency and effectiveness, lest the entire enterprise come crashing down like a house of cards in a gale.\n\nThus, the manager must weave a tapestry of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, a complex dance of threads that must be pulled tight lest the fabric of the supply chain fray and unravel. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of the market, the customer, and the inner workings of the company itself. And yet, for those who succeed in this endeavor, the rewards are great, for they shall be the masters of the invisible web that binds the world together. \n\nIn the retail stores where I once toiled, I saw this dance played out in the details, the uniform, the receipt of shipment, the flow of goods from production to customer. Each step was choreographed, each move a part of a greater whole, a symphony of supply chain management that played out in the quiet moments of each day. And I saw, too, the consequences of error, the confusion and the chaos that arose when the steps were not followed, when the details were not attended to. But when the process was followed, when the steps were executed with precision and care, the result was a symphony of efficiency and effectiveness, a dance of supply chain management that wove together the threads of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information into a seamless tapestry of customer satisfaction.",
            "A faded sign hung crookedly from a pole, a grim announcement in a land far away. Hitler alive, it declared, in Burma's dark heart. Ellen Page stood alone on a street corner, her cardboard placard held aloft like a banner of despair. Burma, a kingdom ravaged by tyranny, a land where the iron fist of a militant junta had crushed the spirits of its people. A place where the drums of protest had beaten out a cadence of defiance, where monks in saffron robes had marched against the darkness, their voices carrying the wind like a mournful sigh. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of hope, had been brutally snuffed out by the guns and bayonets of the regime. The streets ran red with blood, the monasteries lay in ruin, and the foreign press was silenced, their witnesses to the carnage either imprisoned or killed.\n\nBut Burma was not alone in its suffering. The shadow of oppression loomed over every land, a specter of tyranny that had haunted the very dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing all opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a living deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of modernity and the rituals of the samurai. And in the United States, a land of liberty and freedom, the president held court with a man of God, a man who spoke in tongues of fire and brimstone, his words a litany of hate and intolerance.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square whispered through the ages, their cries of protest muffled by the walls of silence that shrouded the city. The death toll of that fateful night was lost to the ages, a mystery shrouded in the mists of official deceit. But the echoes of the Rwandan genocide lingered, a haunting reminder of the horrors that humanity was capable of inflicting upon itself. And in the depths of the Third Reich, a darkness had descended, a shadow that had consumed the very soul of Europe, leaving nothing but ash and ruin in its wake.\n\nIn this world of darkness, where the light of freedom was but a distant memory, the sign on the street corner seemed a pitiful reminder of the futility of resistance. Yet it stood as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But what was the use of hope in a world where the strong devoured the weak, and the tyrants ruled with an iron fist? The sign seemed a cruel joke, a cruel reminder of the darkness that had consumed all in its path.\n\nEllen Page's eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, a knowledge that the world was a place of shadows and darkness, where the light of hope was but a fleeting dream. She stood there, a solitary figure, a tiny voice crying out in a wilderness of despair. And as the wind rustled her cardboard placard, the words seemed to echo through the ages, a haunting reminder of the human condition in all its brutal simplicity: Hitler alive in Burma, a sign of the darkness that lurked within us all.",
            "The echoing legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz was forged in the crucible of his longevity, a testament to the boundless wellspring of creativity that coursed through him. Like a master craftsman shaping the silences and cadences of his music, Ellington's subtle presence on the piano wove a sonic tapestry that allowed the individual threads of his orchestra to shine forth in all their glory. His compositions were masterful in their ability to provide a framework for soloists to improvise, yet tightly orchestrated to highlight the unique timbres of each player. In this way, Ellington not only showcased the individual talents of his musicians but also imbued his ensemble with a distinctive tone, a harmonic language that spoke to the very soul of the music.\n\nIn his oeuvre, Ellington's mastery of his players' unique voices and the interplay between them allowed him to craft some of the most innovative and sublime works in jazz history. His pioneering use of voice as a jazz instrument, as exemplified in Creole Love Call, was a hallmark of his artistry. This early piece, with its call-and-response structure and six choruses, demonstrated Ellington's ability to elevate the voice to a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. The progression of choruses - from the sweet, melodic call of the first section to the climactic reed-dominated finale - showcased Ellington's skill in crafting a narrative arc that was both subtle and powerful.\n\nIn Creole Love Call, Ellington's innovative use of voice was only one facet of his genius. The piece's carefully crafted structure, with its call-and-response patterns and solos, underscored the importance of texture and timbre in his music. Each chorus was a masterclass in tone color, with the voice, reeds, and brass sections weaving together in a rich and intricate tapestry. The piece's climax, with its syncopated stop-time rhythms and soaring reed melodies, was a testament to Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz expression.\n\nEllington's later works, such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), further demonstrated his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color. In these pieces, he skillfully combined the vocal and instrumental elements of his ensemble to create rich, complementary sounds that elevated the music to new heights. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing in Hot and Bothered was a particularly striking example of Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz, while It Don't Mean a Thing showcased his skill in introducing melodies on muted trombone.\n\nIn Ellington's music, the voice was not just a instrument, but a metaphor for the very essence of jazz itself - a fluid, expressive, and ever-changing entity that could be molded and shaped to evoke the deepest emotions and experiences of the human condition. His legacy, like the music itself, continues to resonate with us, a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that defined his artistry.",
            "A want gnawed within her like an unquiet thing. It had begun when she was a girl, fourteen and just wrestling with the turmoil of adolescent becoming. Three years had passed and the ache persisted, a miasma that refused to lift. She'd narrowed her desires to one thing: a person, a presence to ease the hollow in her chest. Yet, the boys who'd sought her out - and there were some - had failed to stir anything in her. It was as if she'd been a door slammed shut to their gentle knockings. She'd asked herself the same questions, night after night, seeking answers that eluded her like a will-o'-the-wisp in the darkness.\n\nDays at home were a quiet thing, a stillness that wrapped around her like a shroud. Her parents were a calm couple, their arguments rare and usually confined to her assertion of independence. It was as if she'd been forged from a different metal, one that clashed with the gentle temper of her parents. Today was different, though. A scream in the kitchen shattered the peace, and she rushed to the source, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and worry. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushing out in short, desperate breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, her hands trembling as she helped her mother to her feet. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother's hands fumbled for direction, and with a surge of strength, the daughter lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of disinfectant and sickness, a noxious odor that clung to her like a shroud. But she barely noticed, her mind focused on helping her mother. She rushed her to the front desk, calling out for help as doctors and nurses swarmed around them. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her to sit in a waiting room, her mind a jumble of worry and fear. The fall had been from a stepping stool, her mother's attempt to retrieve a vase from the top shelf. It was a trivial thing, a mistake born of haste and distraction. But to her, it was a fracture in the fragile fabric of their lives, a crack that threatened to spread and consume them whole.",
            "In the desolate expanse of existence, where the ravages of time and decay lay bare, a study sought to unravel the secrets of the Mediterranean Diet, that elusive elixir of life. Like a pilgrim's quest, this endeavor aimed to chart the course of fate, tracing the threads of a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" on the tapestry of existence. The aMed diet, a variant of its more storied cousin, the Mediterranean Diet, held promise as a panacea, bolstered by the virtues of plant-based sustenance, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while eschewing the shadows of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of life was allowed, a concession to the frailty of human will.\n\nEchoes of prior studies whispered an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of cardiovascular mortality. A preceding trial had demonstrated the aMed diet's potency in vanquishing the specter of weight gain and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a triumph of science over the capricious whims of fate. Yet, the whispers of prior research had yet to speak to the province of stroke or stroke mortality, a void waiting to be filled.\n\nIn the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were tracked over two decades. The study's authors computed an aMed diet score six times, from 1984 to 2004, harnessing the power of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" to chart the ebb and flow of nutrient intake. The nurses, like sentinels of the health, continued to participate, a testament to the enduring power of human resolve, with more than 95% of the cohort remaining steadfast throughout the study.\n\nEach FFQ, a snapshot of the participants' dietary habits, was scrutinized, validated by the cold light of medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were classified as \"probable,\" a designation bestowed upon about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. The study also accounted for the incalculable variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, as well as the ephemeral quality of leisure-time physical activity, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo temper the vicissitudes of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary habits, the authors averaged the aMed scores from repeated FFQs, a cumulative measure that spoke to the enduring nature of the participants' dietary choices. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, a litany of variables that might otherwise obscure the study's findings.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical construct that pierced the veil of uncertainty, revealed the association between adherence to the aMed diet and the specter of CHD and stroke. The results spoke to a higher aMed diet score, a badge of honor that conferred a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke on the women who bore it. Over the 20-year span of the study, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. The women who inhabited the realm of the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the aMed diet's enduring power to shape the course of existence.",
            "The ruin that had befallen the land was like a slow-moving shadow, creeping across the once-green fields of the economy. It began in the year of 2007, when the United States, that great behemoth of industry and progress, stumbled into the darkness of a crushing financial crisis. The towers of commerce, once proud and unyielding, now crumpled like fallen spires, their shattered remnants strewn across the barren landscape like the bones of some great beast.\n\nIn those days, the winds of recklessness howled through the corridors of power, whispering sweet nothings to the ears of the mighty. Selfish and naive, the politicians of the time, driven by a hunger for power and a lust for the praise of the masses, cast aside the wisdom of the ancient ones, and instead chose a path of destruction. They pressured the great banks and corporations to issue forth a multitude of sub-prime loans, like so many poisonous seeds, scattering them across the land like a plague. And the loans, like a noxious weed, sprouted forth, entwining the very fabric of the economy, strangling its lifeblood.\n\nFannie Mae, that mighty behemoth of finance, and its sister, Freddie Mac, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these rotten loans, like so many diseased carcasses, into the complex structures known as CDO's and CDS's. And when the borrowers, like so many leaves before a hurricane, defaulted on these loans, the banks, like a diseased tree, began to wither and die. The chaos that ensued was like a maelstrom, sweeping away all in its path, leaving naught but ruin and devastation in its wake.\n\nBut the roots of this catastrophe ran deep, like the taproots of some ancient, gnarled tree. It began in the year of 1999, when the Clinton administration, like a great and foolish king, sought to bolster its popularity by relaxing the lending restrictions that had once held the banks in check. And thus, like a slow-moving poison, the seeds of destruction were sown, waiting to sprout forth in the years to come.\n\nThe great Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, had foreseen the consequences of this folly, writing in the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He had seen the writing on the wall, and had warned of the coming storm, but his words fell on deaf ears.\n\nAnd so, like a great and mighty river, the economy flowed headlong into the abyss, its waters churning and foaming with the complex structures of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The households of America, like so many ships on a stormy sea, were over-leveraged and vulnerable, their very existence threatened by the slightest change in the tides of the market.\n\nAnd then, like a great and terrible reckoning, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, like so many great and mighty beasts, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. And in the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold like so many sacrificial lambs, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation.\n\nFannie and Freddie, those great and mighty twins of finance, were left to face the music, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a heavy burden to bear. And in September 2008, they were placed under the control of the government, like so many wayward children, their future uncertain, their fate sealed.\n\nThus, the financial crisis of 2007 was like a great and mighty storm, a tempest that shook the very foundations of the economy, and left in its wake a trail of ruin and devastation. And though the winds may have died down, the damage remains, a constant reminder of the folly of those who would seek to control the uncontrollable, and the price of hubris.",
            "Exposition is that seductive siren, luring the writer down the rocky shores of narrative with promises of ease and efficiency. But it's a treacherous ally, a subtle thief that steals time from the tale, leaving the reader adrift in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nWe've all been there, caught in the undertow of too much information, our minds numbed by the weight of unnecessary exposition. Dr. Merlin's eyes glaze over as she scans the page, her mind screaming for the writer to show, not tell. The words blur together, a jumbled mess of backstory and history, until she's tempted to shout at the screen, to wrestle the writer to the ground and demand a more nuanced approach.\n\nExposition is the easy way out, the lazy choice that says, \"Just get this out of the way, and then we can get to the good stuff.\" But the good stuff is precisely what's lost in the telling. When a writer falls back on exposition, they're not only cheating themselves but also their readers, who crave the subtle dance of suggestion, the whispered hints that leave the imagination to fill in the blanks.\n\nConsider the heroine who meets her beloved, only to have the entire sequence of events recounted in a dry, prosaic manner. The reader is left with a hollow feeling, a sense that the story's potential has been squandered on a lazy narrative shortcut. Where are the moments of tender intimacy? The whispered promises? The stolen glances that speak volumes? These are the things that make us care, that make us invest in the characters and their struggles.\n\nIn the best of fiction, exposition is a subtle thing, a whispered aside that reveals character and context without overwhelming the reader. It's the gentle touch that awakens the imagination, allowing the reader to fill in the gaps and become an active participant in the story. Anything more, and we risk losing ourselves in a sea of unnecessary detail, our minds numbed by the weight of too much information.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the siren's song of exposition. It may promise ease and efficiency, but it's a lie. The true magic happens in the spaces between the words, in the suggestions, the implications, and the silences. Leave room for the reader's imagination to breathe, and you'll find that your story comes alive in ways you never thought possible.",
            "He sat in the dark, his eyes fixed on the glowing screen. The news crawled across it like a diseased thing, eating away at the edges of his mind. He watched as the faces of the damned passed before him, their stories a litany of violence and despair. In Columbus, Ohio, a man named Shad Hostettler had committed a heinous crime, his mug shot a twisted mockery of a smile. The news anchor's voice dripped with a false sense of importance, a fleeting concern for the victim's fate, before moving on to the next tale of woe. \n\nA young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, his life hanging by a thread. The SWAT team was on the case, but the details were scarce, the narrative sparse. The anchor's voice faltered, a hesitation in the delivery, a telltale sign that this was a story that didn't quite fit the mold. A black neighborhood, a black victim – a story best left unspoken, or at least, unremarked upon.\n\nThe news continued, a jarring montage of images and voices, each one a reminder of the world's indifference. A gunshot hole in a helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a five-thousand dollar reward for information. The anchor's voice rose and fell, a maudlin melody, as the camera panned across the landscape, a desolate expanse of ash and ruin.\n\nAnd then, the stories of the marginalized, the forgotten. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie, the emphasis on his appearance a telling sign of the world's biases. The anchor's voice dripped with a sense of menace, as if the very act of describing the perpetrator was a crime in and of itself.\n\nA convicted Texas drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic man with a 25-year sentence, or rather, 300 months. The anchor's voice paused, a calculated pause, as if to emphasize the severity of the punishment. But was it a attempt to make the sentence sound more palatable, more acceptable? The anchor's words hung in the air, a faint whisper of a question, a hint of a doubt.\n\nAs the news continued, the faces of the damned blended together, their stories indistinguishable from one another. The world outside was a cold, unforgiving place, a place where lives were reduced to mere headlines, and the only constant was the endless cycle of violence and despair. He turned off the screen, the glow fading into the darkness, leaving him with only the echoes of the damned.",
            "The bond between brothers is a thing of unyielding ferocity, a tether that binds them together in the crucible of their shared existence. Within this bond, a cauldron of emotions simmers: the tender warmth of love, the acid sting of jealousy, and the dark stains of cruelty. Brothers see themselves in one another, their own reflections staring back at them like a ghostly apparition. And it is in the depths of desperation, when the world around them is reduced to a desolate expanse, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this knowledge is steep, a reckoning that weighs heavily upon the heart. To gaze into the eyes of a brother is to confront one's own visage, unvarnished and unflinching. In the actions that follow, the true character of the brother is revealed, a tapestry woven from the threads of their shared experiences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers navigate this treacherous terrain, their journey a futile quest through a landscape as beautiful as it is unforgiving. The bitter disappointment that festers within them is a palpable thing, a wound that sears the soul. And yet, it is in the crucible of this emotion that pride is tempered, a double-edged sword that cuts both ways. The climactic scene, a moment of unbridled fury, is the culmination of a lifetime of unspoken resentments and long-held desires. Only one brother escapes the carnage, his life a testament to the indomitable will to survive.\n\nThrough direct characterization and the narrator's unflinching gaze, the complexities of the protagonist's emotions are laid bare. His actions, a twisted web of pride and resentment, are a tangled skein that cannot be unraveled. From the moment he and his brother, Doodle, step into the swamp, the narrator's voice whispers a haunting melody, a dirge that underscores the protagonist's unyielding obsession with his own desires. He had envisioned a brother who would be his equal, a partner in every sense of the word. But Doodle's fragile form, a reminder of the fragile thread that binds life to death, is an affront to his grandiose plans.\n\nThe protagonist's heart seethes with anger, a cauldron of resentment that threatens to boil over at any moment. He recalls the dark thought that had crept into his mind, a monstrous impulse to silence Doodle's fragile voice forever. And yet, it is in the brief, shining moment when Doodle smiles that his conviction wavers, a fleeting glimpse of a love that has been hidden beneath the surface all along. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a brother forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own making.\n\nThe bond between brothers is a thing of unyielding ferocity, a bond that cannot be broken. It is a crucible, a testing ground where the very fabric of their existence is forged. And in the end, it is this bond that proves to be the protagonist's undoing, a double-edged sword that cuts both ways, leaving only one brother standing, his life a testament to the indomitable will to survive.",
            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the human mind, a complex tapestry of creative information weaving unfolds. As the fabric of technology has evolved from its primordial threads to the intricate patterns of the modern era, so too have the metaphors that sought to describe the brain's mysterious workings. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, a blank slate awaiting the inscription of thought. Then, like a papyrus scroll, it was seen as a surface upon which the ink of experience was poured. The book, a vessel for the collected knowledge of humanity, came next, its pages dog-eared and worn from the weight of understanding. And now, in our era of wonder, it is likened to a computer, a device that processes information with the cold efficiency of a mechanical heart.\n\nBut even as we employ these metaphors, we must be mindful of their limitations, lest we succumb to the pitfall of erroneous conclusions. For the brain is a far more wondrous and intricate machine than any of these analogies can hope to capture.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs, those gatekeepers of the physical world, which transmute the raw data of the universe into electrochemical signals. These signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are swept up and transformed by the brain's algorithms, both from below and from above. Bottom-up processing, like a river flowing downhill, gathers disparate threads of information and weaves them into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, on the other hand, like a master weaver, uses the fruits of this labor to guide the recognition of patterns and meaning.\n\nAs the information is processed, an attention filter, like a skilled editor, sifts through the detritus of the mind, deciding which signals are worthy of notice and which may be discarded. And though the brain may process every blade of grass beneath our feet, it is the attention filter that allows us to pick out our name, spoken in a cacophony of noise.\n\nThe brain's storage facilities are a labyrinth of memory, with multiple compartments for sensory, working, and long-term information. Information is encoded, like a letter inscribed on a parchment, in various ways depending on the type of sensory stimulus it has received. Verbal input, for example, may be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like a message written in different alphabets.\n\nBut how is this information maintained? Studies of the animal kingdom suggest that working memory, that fleeting repository of information, is sustained by an electrical signal that loops through a series of neurons like a whispered secret. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be anchored in the very fabric of proteins, like a ship's anchor in the bedrock of the sea floor.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery that has been approached from multiple angles. Some models are based on the way humans retrieve memories, like a map of a forgotten city. Others are drawn from the realm of computer science, where algorithms and data streams weave together to form a tapestry of understanding. And still others are derived from the study of neurophysiology, where the intricate dance of neurons and synapses is observed in all its glory.\n\nThe semantic network model, like a great spider's web, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" may be linked to \"table,\" which in turn may be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But even as we seek to understand the brain's workings through these metaphors and models, we must remain aware of their limitations, lest we become entangled in the very web of our own making.",
            "The scorching critique of technology and the capitalistic underbelly that nurtures it can be seen in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World. The author's scathing indictment of a society that values community above the individual, and immediate gratification above all else, is a searing rebuke of the excesses of modernity. The people, reduced to mere automatons, are conditioned to pursue happiness with a single-minded ferocity, their minds numbed by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and desire.\n\nAs one peers through the lens of Marxist thought, the underlying suspicions of Huxley's critique become apparent. The novelties of modernity - the homogeny of thought, the reification of human experience - are revealed as a cleverly constructed snare, designed to ensnare the unwary in a web of false consciousness. The common citizenry, conditioned to pursue their own selfish interests above all else, are naively unaware of their true position in the grand scheme of things. They are pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, their motivations reduced to a simplistic calculus of gain and pleasure.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, achieved through the ubiquitous use of hypnopædia, is a masterstroke of ideological control. The lower classes, reduced to a state of mindless conformity, are oblivious to the manipulation that surrounds them. They are trapped in a cycle of consumption and desire, their wills reduced to mere automatism. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, are equally complicit, their actions a mere ratification of the existing order.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are a sterile, hollow thing, devoid of depth or meaning. The characters exist in a state of suspended animation, their emotions reduced to a series of shallow, affectless interactions. The novel's refusal to distinguish between characters is a powerful commentary on the dehumanizing effects of modernity. Love, passion, and creativity are absent, replaced by a lifeless, soulless existence.\n\nThe complacency of each social class in their designated role is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. They are trapped in a never-ending cycle of consumption and obedience, their individuality reduced to a mere abstraction. The novel's portrayal of a society in which relationships are reduced to superficial, transactional exchanges is a stinging indictment of the excesses of modernity.\n\nHuxley's critique of Brave New World is a searing rebuke of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. His novel is a warning, a dire prophecy of a future in which humanity is reduced to a mere commodity, a mere cog in the machinery of consumption and desire. The novel's themes of false consciousness, homogeny, and reification are a powerful indictment of the excesses of modernity, a rebuke to a society that values the superficial above the profound.",
            "I've spent nigh on two and a half years wandering these hallowed halls, or rather, navigating the labyrinthine paths that crisscross our campus. For many, including myself, the simple act of traversing this sprawling landscape can be a Sisyphean task. My freshman year, I found myself consigned to a dorm room in the distant reaches of East Halls, a bastion of solitude that seemed as far removed from the thrumming heartbeat of campus as the surrounding woods from the concrete canyons. The trek from my Stuart Hall abode to the far-flung Willard building, that stalwart sentinel of academic rigor, could stretch on for a quarter hour or more, a seemingly interminable expanse of tarmac and pavement that seemed to stretch out before me like a vast, gray sea. Weathered skies and biting winds only served to slow my progress, casting a pall of despondency over the entire endeavor.\n\nBut I have since learned that this was not always so. In days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood as an island, a self-contained bastion of student life, shrouded in a sea of untamed wilderness. The intervening years have seen this empty expanse transformed into a veritable cornucopia of athletic fields, gleaming edifices, and sleek, modern dwellings. The campus, it seems, is forever in flux, a living, breathing entity that shifts and morphs before our very eyes. And with this metamorphosis comes a growing sense of dislocation, a disorientation that threatens to engulf us all.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, I find myself drawn to the humble bicycle as the solution to our mobility woes. But, I dare say, it is not the bike itself that holds the key, but rather our willingness to ride it, to harness its power and channel it towards our collective betterment. The campus, too, must be reshaped in our image, its corridors and thoroughfares designed with the bicycle in mind. Only then can we hope to reclaim our place within this ever-shifting landscape.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who, after a several-year hiatus, has once again taken to the saddle. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"but for a few years, it just wasn't cool to ride a bike. But it's the only way to get around.\" And I find myself in fervent agreement. Not only does cycling offer a modicum of physical exercise, but it also represents the most efficient means of traversing this sprawling campus. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a brief exertion can carry me 30 miles or more, leaving me with the time and energy to pursue my studies unencumbered.\n\nI, too, have found myself forced to navigate the treacherous expanse of Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building from my off-campus abode. The road itself is a gauntlet, a gauntlet that demands focus and fortitude from those who dare to traverse it. But with my trusty steed by my side, I am able to shave precious minutes from my daily commute, cutting the 25-minute walk down to a mere 5 minutes. And though walking has its own merits, I fear I am too beset by the demands of academia to indulge in such leisurely pursuits. Were it not for my bicycle, walking would be my sole option, a Sisyphean task that would drain my time and energy, leaving me drained and spent.\n\nAnd so, I implore our campus leaders to reconsider the needs of the bicycle, to recognize its potential as a unifying force, a thread that weaves our disparate paths together into a tapestry of shared experience. For in embracing the bicycle, we may yet find a solution to the problem of mobility, a solution that will carry us forward, into a brighter, more vibrant future."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I intend to pursue a career within the realm of social work, drawing upon the mandate of the Division of Family and Children Services to aid in the rehabilitation of children who have been subjected to abuse and neglect; and to offer succor to families beset by turmoil. Core tenets that I shall uphold in this pursuit include service, deference, an unyielding commitment to the amelioration of relationships between individuals and families, and a perpetual striving to hone my professional competence, that I may remain an instrument of positive change in this endeavor.\n\nMy inclination towards a life of service has been a driving force throughout my existence. However, the pathway to this vocation has been shrouded in uncertainty. As I navigated the labyrinthine corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many individuals fleeing from the shadows of their problems, ensconced in denial, and others employing coping mechanisms that were far from ideal. It was amidst these scenes of turmoil that I became cognizant of the imperative to help others. My graduation from Piedmont College in 2009 did little to alleviate this sense of purposelessness, and it was not until I encountered a 16-year-old boy, fleeing the cruel whims of his parents, that my resolve was solidified. This young individual, wracked by the anguish of his circumstances, had called upon the authorities for succor, but his pleas had fallen on deaf ears. I chose to intervene, sharing my concerns with the police and frankly explaining my educational background in psychology. As a direct result of my prodding, the boy's parents were forced to confront the gravity of their actions, and though the outcome was far from satisfactory, it galvanized me to pursue a career in social work, wherein I could make a tangible difference in the lives of children such as this.\n\nIn my journey thus far, I have come to understand the paramount importance of social justice. Our society often espouses the notion that the individual is paramount, yet we simultaneously strive for conformity, stifling the true spirit of individuality. I, for one, refuse to be bound by the shackles of conformity, and I shall continue to speak out against the injustices that I witness, whether it be through my attire, my affiliation with the GSBA, or my unwavering commitment to combating racism and discrimination. The pursuit of social justice is not merely a duty, but a sacred obligation, one that I shall uphold, even in the face of adversity.",
            "In the depths of the labyrinthine corridors of sleep, a disorder reigns supreme: insomnia. Two models vie for dominance, each seeking to explain the enigmatic affliction: the Biological model, which delves into the genetic and physiological underpinnings of sleep, and the Sociocultural model, which charts the complex interplay of environmental influences on sleep patterns. This treatise will navigate the dark, winding paths of insomnia, tracing the contours of each model, and excavating the research that illuminates their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a primary sleep disorder, can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder in tandem with another mental affliction, or a sleep disorder triggered by medical complications or substance intake. The Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. The latter, a catch-all category, encompasses the complexities of sleep disorders that defy categorization. Primary Insomnia, a malady of inadequate or disrupted sleep, has its counterpart in Primary Hypersomnia, a condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, both enduring for at least a month. Narcolepsy, a disorder of sudden, intense sleepiness, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssonmias, in their focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, serve as a counterpoint to the Parasomnias, sleep disorders that manifest as behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences. Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder are the archetypes of the Parasomnias, each a manifestation of the darker aspects of the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThe Biological model, a cartographer of the genetic and physiological terrain of sleep, seeks to chart the neural pathways that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a nexus of neural activity, harbors neurons containing orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, receptors that play a pivotal role in modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate somnolence. The study's findings, gleaned from animal models, suggest a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, a receptor whose malfunction can disrupt the sleep-wake cycle. The sociocultural implications of this research are far-reaching, suggesting that an inherited phenotype can regulate sleep, and alterations to the receptor can naturally disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life.",
            "The dimly lit recesses of the mind, where sound and sense converge, are the domain of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition that shrouds the brain's ability to translate the cacophony of the world into meaning. A disorder of the central nervous system, where the echoes of the past and the whispers of the present compete for attention, CAPD is a labyrinth of incomplete perceptions, a maze of missed signals and misinterpreted cues. It is not a disorder of the ears, but of the brain, a fault line that runs deep, where the machinery of comprehension falters, and the whispers of the world are lost in the void.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began to unravel the threads of auditory imperception. Their work, like a faint thread in the darkness, guided subsequent researchers, including Kimura, who, in 1961, shed light on the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception. The national conference of 1977, a rendezvous of minds, marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift.\n\nBut the manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that stretch across the landscape. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between two competing whispers. The sounds of the world may become a jumbled mess, a cacophony of confusion, as the brain struggles to make sense of the chaos. The sequence of sounds may become a jumbled puzzle, as the individual struggles to untangle the threads of time and space. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves lost, unable to navigate the shifting sands of sound.\n\nDiagnosis, like a beacon in the darkness, offers a glimmer of hope. The process begins with a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, a probing of the recesses of the mind. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others, armed with a variety of measures, seek to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the individual, to unravel the tangled threads of perception. But there is no single tool, no one test, that holds the key to diagnosis, only a patchwork of assessments, a quilt of incomplete understandings.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the classroom, where the fabric of education is woven, that the teacher must navigate the complexities of CAPD. In the mainstreamed classroom, where the din of distractions and the hum of disorder compete for attention, the teacher must be attuned to the subtle signs of CAPD, the whispers of confusion, the echoes of disconnection. It is here, in this crucible of learning, that the teacher must be a guide, a navigator, a guardian of the fragile thread of comprehension. For in the labyrinth of the mind, where CAPD reigns, the teacher holds the key to unlocking the secrets of sound and sense.",
            "In the shadowed pages of Twelfth Night, a truth unspoken festers like an open sore. The deception of disguise, a fragile veil that shields us from the cruel winds of reality, threatens to consume us whole. As we don our masks, we risk losing ourselves in the process, our true selves cast aside like autumn leaves on a forgotten wind. And when the moment of truth arrives, we must confront the choice: to shed the disguise and risk the consequences, or to cling to the fragile threads of deception, sacrificing the relationships that bind us to the world.\n\nIn the realm of gender role reversal, the stakes are particularly high. The why of our deception is a question that gnaws at the heart, a whispered inquiry into the depths of our own natures. Viola, a traveler in a foreign land, assumes the guise of a man to shield herself from the predators that lurk in every shadow. Her ruse is a success, yet it comes at a steep price: she is set adrift from the very women who might have offered her a lifeline in this strange and unforgiving world. The weight of her deception bears down upon her, a constant reminder of the fragile web of relationships she has spun.\n\nAnd then, there is the tangled web of desire that ensnares Olivia and Orsino. Viola's disguise serves as a catalyst, forcing them to confront the suppressed longings that lie hidden beneath their surface. Is Olivia's affection for Cesario a genuine emotion, or merely a product of her own blind prejudices? Does she see in Cesario a reflection of her own repressed desires, or does she merely use him as a proxy for her own fascination with the unattainable? The ambiguity of her feelings is a piercing commentary on the societal norms that govern our perceptions of love and desire.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a harsh truth: that our deceptions, though they may offer us temporary shelter from the storms of life, can also lead us further into the darkness. We must confront the masks we wear, and the choices we make, for it is in the act of shedding our disguises that we may discover our true selves, and the world around us, in all its beauty and its brutality.",
            "The ruin of their rule casts a long and malignant shadow across the landscape of South West Africa. The brutal suppression of the Ovaherero and Nama, their genocide a stark reminder of the German colonial empire's baser impulses. Not that it can be reduced to such a simple narrative - the empire's policies and styles varying as wildly as its geography. Education, too, was a disparate and fractured thing, a patchwork of provision across the colonies. In East Africa, where the British would later take hold, the government had established a system of state schools, educating a generation of literate and informed Africans. Yet in South West Africa, a stark and foreboding contrast emerged. The burden of native education was shouldered by missionary societies, limping along on the slender thread of government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished its resources on the education of its own kind, establishing a network of state schools and closely regulating the missionary endeavors that catered to the native masses. The impact of this disparity would be felt for years to come, a scar etched deep into the very fabric of South West Africa.\n\nIn this peculiar and benighted corner of the empire, the majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and lost to the darkness of ignorance. What factors contributed to this divergence? What currents of thought and policy flowed through the minds of settlers and colonial authorities, shaping the course of events in South West Africa? This inquiry seeks to plumb the depths of this question, to identify the underlying forces that forged the colony's unique trajectory.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, but much of it remains locked behind the veil of language and time. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, were often content to simply chronicle the features of educational systems in each colony. Later studies, written in the English tongue, expanded the discussion through comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. One study, penned by Cohen, shed light on the particularities of South West Africa and East Africa, highlighting the factors that set them apart. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, was a land of contrasts, a place where the harsh realities of desert and desertion met the fragile hopes of European settlement. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in this unforgiving landscape, a significant presence in a territory that seemed to stretch out before them like an empty and desolate sea. In comparison, the settler population of East Africa was a mere 5,336, a paltry number in a colony that seemed to hold out the promise of a new and better life.",
            "In the depths of time, a morass of sound has come to be known as Popular Music. A hydra-like beast, it has grown and multiplied over the past century, its tendrils spreading far and wide, giving birth to a multitude of genres that defy easy classification. Within these genres, sub-genres have sprouted like weeds, their own offspring bursting forth in a dizzying array of diversity. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, that most tempestuous and expressive of all, has come to be a behemoth, its influence spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of sound.\n\nLike a raven's call in the dark of night, Heavy Metal resounds with a primal, almost feral energy, its emotions running the gamut from the deepest despair to the most frenzied ecstasy. And yet, it is a music of restraint, its fury and passion held in check by the precision and skill of its practitioners. Like a dark and ancient ritual, it has evolved over the years, its adherents seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible, to tap into the very essence of the music itself.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was little more than a whisper, a faint hint of something new and different in the air. But as the years went by, it grew in power and complexity, its tendrils reaching out to claim new territory, to incorporate the influences of other genres and styles. And yet, despite its diversity, Heavy Metal remains a movement, a force that drives its adherents to push the boundaries of what is possible, to seek out new and darker sounds, and to express the depths of human emotion in a way that is both cathartic and terrifying.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that revels in the primitive and the visceral, that seeks to tap into the raw emotions of the human heart. And yet, it is also a music of precision and skill, its practitioners honing their craft to create a sound that is at once both beautiful and brutal.\n\nOne need look no further than the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" to see the seeds of Heavy Metal sown. A song of raw, unbridled energy, it is a testament to the power of the music to capture the darkness and the chaos of the human experience. And yet, it is also a song of precision and control, its rhythms and harmonies carefully crafted to create a sense of tension and release that is at once both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, Heavy Metal is a music that defies easy categorization, a hydra-like beast that is always changing, always evolving. But at its core, it remains a music of the shadows, a reflection of the darker aspects of the human experience. It is a music that speaks to our deepest fears and our greatest passions, a music that is both beautiful and brutal, and that will continue to captivate and inspire us for generations to come.",
            "In the realms of the art world, a quiet dreamer named Henri Rousseau toiled, his brushstrokes driven by the whispers of a longing that had haunted him for years. A painter of unassuming talent, he sought to transcend the mundane boundaries of his existence and leave an indelible mark upon the world. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, stood as a testament to the turmoil that raged within him - a struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the conventions of a world that seemed determined to stifle his creativity.\n\nAs one delves into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's life, the threads of his biographical tapestry begin to unravel, revealing a man beset on all sides by the cruel whims of fate. Born into a world of modest means in the northwest French town of Laval, Henri Rousseau's early years were marked by the prosaic drudgery of a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee. It was not until the unforgiving hand of mortality claimed his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, that he found solace in the gentle solace of art. The ache of his grief, though still raw, was slowly soothed by the gentle caress of his brushstrokes, as he poured his heart and soul onto the canvas.\n\nIn a world where the art world's elite seemed to congregate around the likes of Matisse, a painter of refinement and elegance, Rousseau found himself an outsider, a folk painter driven by the simple, unpretentious desires of the common man. His art, a reflection of his own unyielding hopes and dreams, was a far cry from the romanticized portrayals of the peasantry that captivated the hearts of his contemporaries. And yet, it was this very authenticity that would ultimately become the source of his torment - a constant struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the stifling conventions of a world that seemed determined to ignore him.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the chasm between Rousseau and Matisse was not merely one of style or subject matter, but of purpose itself. While Matisse's art was driven by a terror of mediocrity, Rousseau's was fueled by a desire to conform, to be accepted by the very same art world that seemed to mock him. It was a dichotomy that would haunt him for the rest of his days, a constant reminder that his art, like his very existence, was a fragile, flickering flame, vulnerable to the whims of fate.\n\nIn the Dream, we see Rousseau's own inner turmoil, a maelstrom of conflicting desires and doubts that threatened to consume him whole. It is a painting of unassuming beauty, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. And it is in this very painting that we find the key to understanding Rousseau's enduring legacy - a legacy that transcends the boundaries of style and technique, speaking instead to the very heart of the human experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a whispered truth echoes through the ages: that ethics and aesthetics are bound together by an unseen thread, a delicate weave of beauty and truth. Like the first light of dawn creeping over a ravaged landscape, this connection beckons us to explore the depths of the human experience. John Keats, in his immortal \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" reminds us that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" But how do we come to this understanding? Is it through the dusty tomes of academia or the trials of life? Or perhaps it is something more primal, a whisper in the darkness that guides us towards the elusive essence of beauty and morality.\n\nWe seek to explain the unexplainable, to grasp the slippery tendrils of truth that dance just beyond our fingertips. Our studies of morality and beauty are a perpetual dance of description and prescription, a futile attempt to pin the ephemeral to the page. We speak of foreground and background, of context and contrast, but these words, like autumn leaves, wither and fade the moment we grasp them. The critics' analyses, like the shifting sands of a desert oasis, prove hollow and unsatisfying, a meager substitute for the whispered truth that only the soul can hear.\n\nWhen asked to explain the magic of a masterpiece, we often falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase \"There's just something about it.\" This, I believe, is the transcendental nature of art and morality, that elusive je ne sais quoi that defies capture. It is the whispered promise of the sublime, the quiet voice that speaks directly to the heart. As Flannery O'Connor so eloquently puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And so, too, with ethics: a description, no matter how complete, cannot fully capture the essence of what is right or wrong.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened when we experience them in a state of noumenal awareness, a realm beyond the limits of language and reason. It is a realm where the distinctions between art and life blur, and the values we hold dear are revealed in all their beauty and complexity. As McKean reminds us, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" In this desolate world, where the boundaries between art and life have grown indistinct, we find the whispered truth that binds us all: that beauty and truth are one, and that their connection is the very essence of the human experience.",
            "The land of Germany, a realm forged from the crucible of disparate cultures, its essence distilled from the confluence of Alpine shadows to the Baltic's gray expanse. The Rhine's flow, like a lifeblood, courses through its heart, nourishing the cities of München and Kiel, Köln and Dresden. A land of contradictions, born of various tribes and sources, yet united in its resilience. The Germania, as the ancestral land of the Germans, its origins shrouded in mystery, a tale of disputed etymology.\n\nSome say the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others claim Julius Caesar's use of the term \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars originated from the Gauls themselves, a distinction made to separate the conquered from the unconquered (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Still, others propose that it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue, or perhaps the spear, the \"ger,\" used in ancient warfare (O.E.D, 2010). The Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" may also be a possible source, hinting at the Germans' reputation for loudness.\n\nIn his writings, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" regarded the Germans as aboriginal, unadulterated by foreign bloodlines (Tacitus, 98). He described their land as inhospitable, their people as sullen and taciturn. Who would brave the unforgiving climate and harsh landscape to leave behind the comforts of Italy and Rome for the unknowns of Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet. They would send out expeditions to exploit the land's resources, but ultimately return to their dominion.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they inhabited the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills in exchange for Roman patronage (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). Thus, the foundation of modern Germany was laid, a tapestry woven from the threads of various cultures, its essence forever tied to the land of Germania.",
            "I gazed down at the view before me, my mind a blank slate, inscrutable and unyielding.  The scene unfolded before me like a canvas, awaiting the strokes of some unseen hand.  My thoughts drifted in like wisps of smoke, vanishing as swiftly as they appeared.  I was a vessel, a hollow reed, blown by the winds of perception.  My consciousness flowed like a river, unencumbered by the weight of thought or emotion.  I was a mere observer, a traveler on the banks of a vast and uncharted sea.\n\nI recalled the words of an artist who had once counseled me: \"Frame the picture, see the world anew.\"  I had stumbled upon an old book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which claimed to hold the secrets of perception.  The book spoke of the power of the square frame, of how it could transform the intricate web of life into a simple, graspable whole.  I had sought to apply this principle to my own creative endeavors, to see the world with fresh eyes.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, my mind was a maelstrom of confusion.  The colors, the shapes, the textures - all swirled together in a maddening dance.  I was lost, adrift in a sea of sensation.  I longed to impose order on the chaos, to frame the picture and see the world anew.\n\nAnd then, like a whispered secret, the artist's frame appeared.  A square of simplicity, a border of clarity.  The world snapped into focus, and I beheld the bowl, a bowl of fruit, a simple, elegantly formed object, suspended in a sea of nothingness.  I was Picasso in his blue phase, Monet in his green, the Italian Renaissance masters in their rainbow of colors - I was an artist, a weaver of worlds.\n\nMy hand reached out, a brush poised to strike, my fingers trembling with anticipation.  The handle of the pencil, a tool of creation, felt alive in my hand.  I brought it to the paper, a sheet of blank and waiting possibility.  And then, like a burst of creation, my hand moved, a flow of movement and energy, a dance of life.\n\nBut my hand faltered, and my attention turned to the toilet, a vessel of waste and decay.  A brown package, a slug-like thing, clung to the bottom of the bowl.  I gripped the mop, a tool of cleansing, and my hand moved, a slow and deliberate dance, a ritual of purification.  I was a priest, a minister of the mundane, a weaver of the everyday.\n\nAs I stood, my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie knotted around my neck, I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of processed matter, a thing without form or purpose.  I was a servant, a janitor, a cleaner of the unspeakable.  My hand reached out, a hand of service, and I began to wipe, to cleanse, to purify.\n\nAnd then, like a mother, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a gesture of devotion, a ritual of care.  I was a servant, a caretaker, a weaver of the everyday.  The world, a vast and mysterious tapestry, unfolded before me, a canvas of endless possibility.",
            "The wilderness of the highway, a killing field where the young and reckless are consumed by their own momentum. The statistics scream of a wanton disregard for life, a heedless dance with death on wheels. The National Institutes of Health reveal a cold truth: the adolescent brain, still a fledgling in its formative years, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. The fragility of inexperience, a chasm of uncertainty, yawns open, waiting to swallow the unwary whole. It is here, in this desolate expanse, that the adolescent's recklessness finds its inevitable end.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center laid bare the correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. The numbers tell a tale of a reckless abandon, a wanton disregard for the lives at stake. The state of California, and others, have attempted to stem the tide of this calamity with provisional licenses, their hours of operation curtailed, their passengers limited to those of a certain age. But these measures, stopgaps though they may be, are feeble attempts to stem the tide of a far more profound issue.\n\nThe problem, you see, is not one of licensing or restriction, but rather of a fundamental inability to grapple with the risks and responsibilities of the road. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19-20 is too young for the unfettered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of the thrill, a siren's call to the young and reckless, is a powerful force, one that cannot be easily resisted. To issue driver's licenses to those too young to temper their impulses is to invite disaster, to court a death toll that will rise to catastrophic levels in the years to come. The baby-boomer's children, a tidal wave of new drivers, will soon flood the roads, bringing with them a renewed wave of carnage.\n\nLegislation, then, is the only bulwark against this maelstrom. Schools must continue to provide driver's education, a primer for the novice behind the wheel. But the key lies in waiting, in holding back the reins until the adolescent brain has matured, until the tendency to take risks has begun to wane. A national law, uniform and unyielding, would provide the necessary framework, a shield against the recklessness that threatens to consume us all. The hours of training, the number of practice sessions, would be standardized, a benchmark against which all drivers would be measured. And so, the death toll would begin to fall, a slow but inexorable decline into the abyss of safety.\n\nThis is no novel idea, merely a recognition of the obvious, a truism that has been hiding in plain sight. The statistics scream of a need for change, a plea for the young to be protected from themselves. Let us heed this call, and legislate a safer road, a road where the young and the reckless are not consumed by their own momentum, but rather guided by the wisdom of experience and the steady hand of responsibility.",
            "In the musty depths of the Library of Congress, I stumbled upon a trove of early Edison films, their fragile reels whispering secrets of a bygone era. My gaze wandered to the trick films, a litany of fifteen from 1895 to 1901, each one a masterclass in deception. As I delved into their poetics, I found myself enthralled by the ways in which creative editing wove illusions. My exploration centered on the lasting influence of these trick films, particularly in the evolutionary outliers that dared to push the boundaries of the established forms.\n\nThe early trick films, bound by the shackles of their time, adhered to a strict framework: static cameras, frontal prosceniums, and a reliance on long and medium shots. The one shot, one film mantra, a strict adherence to the theatrical traditions that shaped the very fabric of these silent spectacles. Yet, as the century turned, a few bold innovators began to chip away at these conventions, introducing the forbidden fruit of multiple shots.\n\nA cursory glance at the trick films reveals a curious consistency: they are all born from the womb of the interior set, a frontal proscenium that frames the action, a stage set against which the players dance. The camera remains steadfast, a sentinel of the proscenium, refusing to yield to the siren's call of movement. This adherence to the theatre and vaudeville traditions resulted in a limitation: figures in these films moved only side to side, their paths a stilted waltz across the horizontal axis. Even as they disappeared from view, the camera remained fixed, a static witness to their vanishing acts.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style gave rise to a preponderance of long shots and, on rare occasions, medium shots. Close-ups, those intimate whispers to the audience, were a rarity, a luxury not afforded to these early trick films. This adherence to the theatrical tradition, where the audience beheld the entire performance within the borders of the stage, rendered close-ups anathema. The actors, locked in their designated spaces, remained steadfast, their movements confined to the middle ground, never venturing forth to tempt the lens.\n\nMost trick films, bound by the shackles of their format, adhered to the dictum that one conceptual shot equaled a film. This strict adherence limited the length of these trick films to a minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of magic and wonder. Narrative and drama were secondary to the vaudeville-style tricks that populated these early films: magic, disappearing acts, and the switcheroo. Yet, upon closer inspection, one discovers that the apparent simplicity of these trick films belies a more complex reality. A single \"shot\" may conceal multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a prime example of this sleight of hand, its physical shot masked by the conceptual unity of the viewer's experience.",
            "In the sterile light of history, a figure emerged - John Taylor of Caroline. A man of unwavering conviction, his fervor for Republicanism burned like a fire in the desolate landscape of his time. His life's work, a testament to his unshakeable dedication to the agrarian way, left an indelible mark on the creases of American politics. Like a withered tree, his views on government, sovereignty, and the judicial system were rooted in the soil of his profession, their branches stretching towards the heavens in a futile attempt to defy the encroaching darkness.\n\nAs he traversed the barren expanse of American ideology, Taylor clutched to his chest the notion of an agrarian system, a beacon of hope in a world beset by the ravages of time. His arguments, a litany of defiant denunciations, raged against the tides of despotism, calling forth a world where the rights of man, like a parched traveler in a desert landscape, would be safeguarded from the predations of a government grown bloated and tyrannical.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Taylor would often whisper to himself the words of the Declaration of Independence, its phrases a sacred incantation that conjured forth a world where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were recognized, and a government was forged to temper the destructive tendencies of its citizens. Like a blacksmith shaping the molten metal of society, Taylor's vision sought to create a system where the virtues of private property, agriculture, and communal well-being were forged into a crucible of justice.\n\nA man of unyielding rigidity, Taylor's views on morality were a dichotomy, a stark contrast between the light and the darkness. He saw the world as a dualistic tapestry, with the inherent good and evil of humanity forever intertwined. As he gazed out upon the desolate landscape, he cried out against the encroaching shadows, his words a battle cry against the forces of avarice and self-interest that threatened to consume all in their path.\n\nTaylor's battle cry, a clarion call to arms, was his advocacy for a strict construction of the Constitution, a bulwark against the encroaching tide of Federal power. Like a sentinel guarding the gates of freedom, he warned against the dangers of a government grown too large, too powerful, too consumed by its own ambition. And yet, he knew that a simple, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a double-edged sword, capable of cutting both ways, depending on the intentions of its wielder.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, a shining beacon of hope in a world gone mad. Like a ghostly apparition, Taylor's spirit still haunts the landscape of American politics, a reminder of a time when the ideals of freedom and self-government were not mere abstractions, but living, breathing realities that shaped the course of history.",
            "The numbers fell like autumn leaves from the trees, plummeting in the third month of the project. It was a sight that cut deep, a decline that seemed without reason or respite. As the snows crept in like a thief in the night, it was said that fewer hands were able to reach for their bicycles or their feet to carry them to work. Perhaps this was the explanation. Perhaps it was the weight of the semester's end, when the minds were elsewhere and the body's labors were forgotten. The holidays, with their long and listless breath, had descended upon the world, a season of forgetfulness and of quiet. And yet, none of these things could account for the cold, dark silence of February. It was as if the project's spark had been extinguished, leaving naught but embers to smolder in the darkness.\n\nIt was as if the initial fervor had worn thin, like a threadbare coat worn to the bone. The Carpool Challenge Week, a last-ditch effort to rekindle the flame, had brought a fleeting spark, but it was a spark that flickered and died. The challenge of maintaining momentum had proven a Sisyphean task, a weight that pressed upon the shoulders of all who toiled to keep the project alive.\n\nAnd then there was the ingrained desire, a primal urge, to be free and unencumbered, to ride the open road with the wind in one's hair. It was a freedom that had been lost, a liberty that had been sacrificed upon the altar of convenience and of habit. And so, the prizes, once a beacon of hope, now seemed paltry and weak, insufficient to stir the hearts of those who had grown complacent in their ways.\n\nPerhaps, it was said, that had we offered greater rewards, prizes of greater value and allure, the numbers might have risen, the enthusiasm might have been rekindled. A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car – these were prizes that would have spoken to the hearts of those who had grown numb to the project's call. But alas, it was too late, the damage had been done, and the numbers had fallen, a precipitous drop that seemed to mark the end of all hope.",
            "In the vast expanse of the market, a peculiar entity roams, shrouded in mystery, yet possessing a certain allure. This is the ETF, a creature of the modern era, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, yet imbued with the flexibility of a lone stock. Like a chameleon, it can blend seamlessly into the landscape, offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share with ease. Its expense ratios, a mere whisper compared to the average mutual fund, beckon the savvy investor like a siren's call.\n\nYet, like any creature of the wild, the ETF has its predators and pitfalls. The commissions that must be paid for each trade, a toll exacted by the market, can be a heavy burden. The wide variety of funds available, a veritable feast for the investor, can also be a curse, for in the midst of plenty, lies the danger of confusion and misdirection.\n\nFor the purposes of this inquiry, we shall focus on the ETF IHF, a creature of peculiar fascination, and examine its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of its assets. Like a zoologist studying the habits of a rare beast, we shall delve into the characteristics of these holdings, seeking to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF can match the rewards of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it.\n\nTo avoid the tedium of an exhaustive examination, we shall confine our attention to the top 10 holdings, a select group that holds the key to understanding the ETF's secrets. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised solely of these 10 stocks, in the proportions established by the ETF.\n\nThe chart that follows reveals a striking truth: the return of a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings surpasses that of the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a finding that suggests a potentially more stable and profitable configuration.\n\nHowever, the question remains: are these results statistically significant, or merely a product of chance? To answer this, we must examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF. Only by subjecting these creatures of the market to the crucible of statistical analysis can we uncover the truth about their strengths and weaknesses.",
            "In the hushed silences between the pages of his works, a whispered truth surfaces - Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his own nocturnal wanderings. The term \"Thulé\", a word he uses with eerie frequency, originates from the obscure recesses of Virgil's legacy. The Roman poet once employed it to describe a distant isle beyond the northwestern horizon, a place where the known world dwindled to a faint outline.\n\nPoe's fascination with the Germanic tradition cannot be overstated. His affinity for the lyrical cadences of Goethe's verse is a well-documented fact, one that Karl J. Arndt astutely noted in his analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\". The parallelisms between their works suggest a deep reverence for the German master's craft. \n\nA closer examination of Goethe's \"Faust\" reveals a poem within the poem, \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting elegy that speaks to the desolate landscape of loss. The king, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the abyss of his grief, his life force ebbing away like the tide. This somber tale mirrors the melancholy of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker finds himself adrift in a world drained of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" as a refrain, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the edges of his poem, bespeaks a deep fascination with Goethe's work. The fact that Goethe's \"Faust\" was translated into English in 1842, mere months before Poe's own reference to \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", only serves to underscore the connection between the two writers.\n\nPoe's oeuvre is replete with allusions to the German master, a testament to the profound impact Goethe's work had on his own creative vision. His admiration for Tennyson, another English poet, only serves to underscore the breadth of his literary influences. The whispered echoes of Goethe's verse, lingering in the shadows of Poe's works, remind us that the boundaries between art and influence are often blurred, and that the creative impulse can be a labyrinthine path of echoes and reflections.",
            "In the sterile halls of jurisprudence, a question forms, like a slow-burning ember, consuming all in its path. Could a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, claim punitive damages in the aftermath of a calamitous slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store? The store manager, Paul Martin, had been informed twice of the spill, and yet he chose to ignore it, engrossed in the fleeting pleasure of his dinner. It is a scenario that bespeaks a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nA judge, wise and detached, would likely deny a motion for summary dismissal of Palmer's claim. To prove that an award of punitive damages is warranted, Palmer must demonstrate that Martin's actions were driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his inaction. Furthermore, she must show that Martin's conduct was despicable, a word that conjures images of a soulless, heartless entity, devoid of empathy or compassion. It is a high bar, but one that Palmer may clear, given the evidence of Martin's negligence.\n\nIn the months preceding Palmer's accident, six customers had been injured in slip-and-fall incidents in the same store. These incidents should have served as a clarion warning to Martin, a red flag that signaled a grave and imminent danger. And yet, he chose to ignore it, prioritizing his own convenience over the safety of his patrons. This is no mere oversight; it is a deliberate choice, a conscious decision to put profits above people.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, dismissed the warning, citing his dinner break as an excuse. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same callous indifference. And it was then, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury.\n\nThe evidence mounts against Martin, a mountain of negligence and malice. Palmer's case is not merely one of carelessness; it is a testament to the systemic failures that allowed a preventable tragedy to occur. The question now is not whether Palmer will prevail, but whether the court will mete out justice, and restore some semblance of balance to a world gone awry.\n\nIn California, the law is clear: punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, in this context, is not merely a fleeting thought; it is a state of mind, a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The law demands a willful and deliberate disregard, a callous indifference to the consequences of one's actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's actions meet the test. He was aware of the probable consequences of his inaction, and yet he chose to ignore them, prioritizing his own interests over the well-being of his customers. This is malice, pure and simple. It is a recklessness that defies comprehension, a callous disregard for the safety of those who trusted him to protect them.\n\nIn the end, it is not merely a question of whether Palmer will win, but whether justice will be served. Will the court recognize the gravity of Martin's actions, and hold him accountable for his negligence? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the law demands justice, and justice demands accountability.",
            "Four winters past I found myself ensnared in the labyrinth of a course on the tenets of Islam at the CBC.  Amidst the fervent debates that raged within the classroom, one question emerged as a behemoth of contention: was Islam a religion born of hostility or of peace?  In the aftermath of that fateful year, 2001, the media's gaze upon Islam had shifted from a withering scorn to an unyielding tolerance.  It was as if the very notion of a presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, whose lineage bore the unmistakable mark of Islam, was an affront to the values of the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, for it stands as a paradox, a tale of contradiction.  The man who was said to have been driven by conviction, who was said to have subdued the tribes through conquest and coercion, now emerges as a martyr, a man of humility and compassion.  His was a story of a man who was misunderstood, who was willing to bend and yield to the will of others, and yet, it was in this very humility that people found the truth, and one by one, they sought him out.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad are striking, and it is this similarity that has long troubled me.  The tale of multiplying mutton and milk, so that there was more than enough for forty men, is a testament to the writer's deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a man of truth, a man who did not need to prove himself, but rather, who lived in the very essence of the divine.  This is a deception, a subtle but insidious lie, for it diminishes the miracle of Jesus Christ, and seeks to co-opt his essence, his very being, for the benefit of another.\n\nMoreover, the stories within the biography seem designed to prove the existence of witnesses, to provide a veritable proof of the truth of the tales.  But these stories, born of third-hand accounts, lack the authenticity that only first-hand testimony can provide.  They are a testimony to the writer's desire to prove the truth, but in doing so, they only serve to erode the credibility of the narrative.\n\nIt is this very exaltation of Muhammad, this portrayal of him as a godly man, a man of humility and compassion, that troubles me the most.  History, however, stands as a stark refutation of this image, and I am left to wonder if the true story of Muhammad's rise to power is one that is known to his followers today.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, once a flame that flickered bright, soon left behind a smoldering ember in the development of Christian thought.  Like a flame that guttered in the darkness, the original intent of Jesus' message was lost in the vast expanse of history.  We see this trend stretched out before us like a desolate landscape, a path that wandered farther and farther from its origin.  The world, now, is a place where awareness stirs, a progressive tide that seeks to reclaim the lost truth.  Yet, traditional minds, like the stubborn roots of an ancient tree, cling to the familiar, resisting any notion that would upend what they have been taught.  They may not be a dominant force, but their presence will be felt, a steady heartbeat that slows the march of progress.\n\nIn time, however, a yearning will grow, a desire to strip away the accretions that have accumulated over the centuries, to reveal the pure, unadulterated essence of the faith.  It will take patience, like the slow burning of a fire that reduces wood to ash, but the outcome is inevitable:  The clock of Christian history will turn backward, and the faithful will be led, like a flock of birds returning to their nesting grounds, back to the original intent of the name that bears its mantle.  One by one, the layers of doctrine will be shed, until only the pure, unvarnished message of Jesus remains, unencumbered by the claims of those who would seek to claim the mantle of his authority.  When this reversal takes hold, sweeping through the United States and Europe like a winter's storm, the church will be transformed, its institution remaining strong, but its theology stripped bare, revealing the simple, unadorned truth of the faith.\n\nThis great reversion is not without precedent.  We see it in the past, like a recurring pattern in the natural world.  Christians, once persecuted and shunned, became the dominant force in the Roman Empire.  Our nation, too, has undergone a similar transformation, emerging from the darkness of slavery to the light of leadership.  The great reversion that is coming will be no different, a story of undoing, of stripping away the accretions of history to reveal the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that has come to characterize the Christian faith.\n\nIt is a crucial distinction that will mark this process:  The words of Jesus will be seen not as literal commands, but as metaphors, their meaning hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.  So what lies beneath the surface of history, waiting to be rediscovered?  We find, at the foundation of the Christian faith, the soil of Judaism, the theology that gave rise to the Christian faith.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, these were the building blocks of the faith, even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  But the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "He believed that the darkness within, the abyss that gnawed at the heart of humanity, was a void of boundless avarice and self-absorption. A chasm that yawned open, revealing a world where the only currency was the advancement of one's own interests, and the well-being of others was but a distant, fading echo. The Jungle laid bare this grotesque spectacle, a gaudy carnival of greed where the owners and managers of the great factories danced with abandon, their eyes fixed on the prize, their souls lost to the abyss.\n\nTheir god was profit, their scripture the bottom line. They cared not for the suffering that their machinations wrought, nor for the lives that were crushed beneath their heel. The smoke that belched from their chimneys was a manifestation of their malevolent disregard, a noxious cloud that shrouded the world, obscuring all that was good and pure. The pens that held the animals, the rivers that ran thick with waste, all were but mere trinkets in the grand game of progress.\n\nTheir employees, mere pawns in this grand scheme, toiled in darkness, their lives a Sisyphean struggle to eke out a meager existence. The hours were long, the labor grueling, and the compensation a paltry handful of coins. And when the whim of the owners struck, the workers were cast aside like so much rubbish, left to fend for themselves in a world that offered little solace. No laws, no regulations, no safety net to catch the falling. Only the cold, unforgiving hand of fate, and the pitiless hearts of those who held the reins.\n\nThe unions, those supposed saviors, were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, preying on the very people they claimed to protect. They feasted on the blood of the workers, leaving them to suffer in the darkness, their cries for help drowned out by the cacophony of greed. And so the workers toiled, their lives but a mere existence, their souls crushed by the weight of their own desperation.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, immorality reigned supreme, a cancer that ate away at the very fabric of society. The Jungle presented a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the voiceless were silenced, and the downtrodden were trampled beneath the feet of the privileged. A world where the only truth was that of the bottom line, and the only morality was that of the dollar.\n\nBut amidst this desolate wasteland, a glimmer of hope flickered, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. For in the darkness, there lay a spark, a flame that burned bright with the promise of resistance, of rebellion, of a better tomorrow. A spark that would one day ignite, casting a fiery glow over the abyss, and illuminating the path to a brighter, more just world.",
            "In the crucible of literature, authors forges the metal of meaning, tempering it with technique, that they might imbue their words with a certain cadence, a certain weight. Some of these techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of manipulation, wields a multitude of these methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He pairs unlikely bedfellows - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an aura around a subject, an exercise in alchemy. Other times, he assigns significance to symbols, only to later reap the benefits of that symbolism. Colors, in particular, prove a fertile ground for Fitzgerald's machinations. He sows the seeds of meaning for certain hues - white/gray and red/pink - and later reaps the harvest of association.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald cultivates a specific connotation for white/gray, a dichotomy that speaks to the very fabric of his narrative. White, in his schema, is a color of elegance, of refinement, of privilege. Gray, on the other hand, is a hue of weariness, of age, of decay. This distinction is first sown in the early pages of the novel, where the use of these colors is as ubiquitous as the ash that chokes the valley of ashes. Daisy and Jordan are forever \"in white,\" their porcelain skin a testament to their social standing. Even the narrator, Nick, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's grand soiree, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when he encounters Myrtle, a woman as faded as the color itself.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by applying these colors to the most mundane of subjects. The streets of New York, for instance, are a \"white chasm,\" a seemingly endless expanse of concrete and steel. Even the names of people at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder that even the elite are bound by the fetters of conformity. The apartment houses, a \"long white cake,\" are a uniform sprawl of sameness, a testament to the crushing homogeneity of modern life.\n\nHowever, it is not until Fitzgerald has sown this meaning that he reap the benefits of his labor. He uses white/gray to signify the unimportance, the uniformity of certain subjects. Daisy, once a vibrant presence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a \"uniform addition\" to Gatsby's world. Her \"white dress\" is a hollow shell of elegance, a reminder of the emptiness at the heart of her character. Even her fur collar is shrouded in a \"gray haze,\" a symbol of the decay that lies beneath her polished surface.\n\nIn the end, Fitzgerald's use of color is a testament to the power of symbolism in literature. By imbuing certain hues with meaning, he creates a rich tapestry of association, a world where the colors of the palette are alive with significance. It is a technique that has captivated readers for generations, a reminder that, in the words of the great author himself, \"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"",
            "The land of San Diego County - a place of plenty, where the sun beats down upon the earth like a hammer upon an anvil. The crops that grow here are a testament to the fertility of the soil and the bounty of the heavens. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with juice and flavor. Citrus fruits hang heavy on the branches, their peels a deep gold in the sunlight. Leafy greens and squash and broccoli and herbs push up through the earth, a verdant carpet that blankets the land. And the tree fruits - peaches and lemons and berries - they grow in profusion, a cornucopia of sweetness and flavor.\n\nIn this land of plenty, there is a growing demand for the kind of food that is grown without the aid of chemicals. Organic community supported agriculture is a thriving enterprise, with many organizations in the San Diego area clamoring for a spot in their programs. The waiting lists are long, a testament to the desire for a cleaner, healthier way of eating. And it is not just the food that is organic - the farms themselves are a draw, with many offering tours and access to hiking and birdwatching trails.\n\nBut the road to success is not an easy one. The landowner must be prepared to put in the work - to till the soil, to plant and harvest, to remove pests and weeds without resorting to chemicals. It is a labor-intensive process, one that requires a deep understanding of the land and its rhythms. And the costs can be high, especially when compared to the large-scale operations that dominate the agricultural landscape. The small organic farm must be efficient, must be able to compete with the big boys on price while also providing a superior product.\n\nAnd yet, there is a reward for this hard work, a reward that goes beyond the profit and loss ledgers. The land, once a barren and lifeless expanse, is transformed into a thriving ecosystem, teeming with life and color. The plants and animals that call this land home are a testament to the power of this way of farming, a way that seeks to work in harmony with nature rather than against it.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This land has a long and storied history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was once part of an original homestead patent, and it is likely that it was used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nToday, this land presents a unique opportunity for a small farmer to create a thriving organic farm, one that not only provides a superior product but also preserves the natural beauty of the area. With the right guidance and support, the landowner could create a model of sustainable agriculture that benefits both the land and the community.\n\nI chose this piece of property from a real estate website and researched the available government programs that a small farmer might use to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. A model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area, one that demonstrates the potential for success in this endeavor.",
            "The chasm between cultures is as vast as the distances that separate us. And yet it's not a chasm of definable edges, but rather a tapestry woven of contrasting threads. A culture is not a singular entity, but rather a multitude of disparate voices that whisper stories of what it is not, as much as what it is. It's a complex weave of the oft-invisible, the unspoken, and the unseen. To attempt to reduce it to broad strokes - \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - is to misunderstand the very essence of its intricacies.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of a foreign culture, one must first grasp the nuances that lie within. It's a journey that begins with the study of its history, the probing of its prejudices, and the recognition of its inherent contradictions. Rather than trying to alter or judge, one must accept it for what it is, a living, breathing entity that defies simplification. In the crucible of negotiation, this acceptance is a virtue, especially when one finds himself at a disadvantage.\n\nBut culture's reach extends far beyond national borders. It seeps into the very marrow of corporate life, manifesting in the dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices of individual companies. A company's culture can be as varied as its employees, with some institutions valuing long hours, while others prioritize flexibility. The evidence of this cultural tapestry is woven into the fabric of everyday life, a reminder that even within the same nation, diversity thrives.\n\nValues, the unseen threads that give culture its strength, are the key to understanding its very essence. If saving face or communal harmony are the guiding principles, a negotiator will think twice before publicly airing his company's dirty laundry. Conversely, a culture that prizes a hard-driven bargain will not be swayed by the promise of a quick resolution. To grasp these subtleties is to grasp the delicate balance of power at the negotiating table.\n\nBut to truly navigate the complexities of a foreign culture, one must also seek to understand the individual who sits across from him. To grasp the personal stories, the motivations, and the desires that drive them. In this, lies the key to effective negotiation, a delicate dance of understanding and empathy that can bridge even the widest of cultural chasms.",
            "Though the fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,' the silence of his words is a hollow echo that rings through the desolate landscape of the soul. This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two venerable thinkers, St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas. Their words, like the faint whispers of a distant wind, seek to convince us of the existence of a divine presence, a being both elusive and all-encompassing.\n\nTo compare these two thinkers, we must first acknowledge that their arguments are a testament to the enduring power of faith. We shall proceed under the assumption that their contemplations are in defense of the God of the Bible, lest we risk comparing apples and oranges in the wilderness of theological debate.\n\nAnselm's path to understanding is a winding road that leads inward, to the recesses of the human heart. He proposes that the existence of God is not something to be discovered in the external world, but rather in the depths of our own understanding. The proof of God's existence lies within the confines of our own mind, a truth that can be intuited by the faithful without the need for empirical evidence. This is a notion that echoes the quiet whispers of the soul, a testament to the power of faith in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more cerebral approach, one that seeks to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical observation. His five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – weave a intricate tapestry of logic that seeks to persuade the doubter with the cold, hard light of reason. Like a master weaver, Aquinas threads together the disparate strands of human experience, creating a fabric of proof that is both convincing and unyielding.\n\nYet, as we examine these arguments, we are left with the nagging sense that neither thinker has provided a comprehensive basis for their beliefs. Their words, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, seem to whisper a truth that is both profound and elusive. In the end, our understanding of God remains a mystery, a labyrinthine path that winds its way through the chambers of the heart.\n\nThus, we are left to ponder the words of the fool, who hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' And we are left to wonder, in the silence of our own hearts, whether the existence of this being is a truth that can be proven, or a faith that must be felt.",
            "In an age long past, before the darkness that had fallen, a prince was born, destined to become the Buddha. His path unwound like a thread through the tapestry of time, from the world's grasp to the stillness of enlightenment. The teachings that flowed from his lips like a river, shaping the contours of a faith that would come to be known as Buddhism. \n\nBut time, that great solvent, had its way with the teachings, eroding the edges, smoothing the rough places. The Theravada sect, a living thing, breathed and adapted, its core unchanged yet its shape shifting to suit the vicissitudes of the world. In the land of Sri Lanka, the water-cutting ceremony unfolded, a pageant of devotion, a testament to the adaptability of the human heart.\n\nMonks and laymen, bound by a shared purpose, participated in this ritual, a tradition that bore no direct link to the Buddha's own words. The fringes of the faith, from the most superficial displays to the very essence of its soteriology, had been reshaped by the forces that buffeted it - the hostile and the benign, the internal and the external.\n\nAs we proceed, certain terms will recur, like the echoes of a distant drumbeat. We speak of internal and external forces, the former born of the Buddha's followers, the latter from outsiders. A hostile force is one that would do harm, that seeks to rend the fabric of the community. A benign force, on the other hand, brings no intention to harm, though its consequences may be far-reaching.\n\nThe core of Theravada Buddhism - the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha - remains steadfast. Refuge lies in this trio, the Buddha, a being of wisdom and compassion; the Dhamma, a body of teachings that seek to illuminate the path; and the Sangha, a community bound by a shared quest for understanding.\n\nAt the heart of the Dhamma lie the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture - the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Concepts like Anatta - the absence of a soul - and Anicca - the impermanence of all things - hold sway, beckoning the follower towards the stillness of the end of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for living, five precepts for the laity, many more for the monastic order. And at the very heart of the teachings lies the Four Noble Truths: that suffering is inherent in life, that attachment brings suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the shadow of time, the twin behemoths of the United States and Mexico stood, their rivalry a festering wound that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. It was a grudging truce between two nations, a ceaseless dance of bitterness and distrust that sprang from the marrow of their shared history. The conflict reached its zenith in the brutal crucible of the Mexican-American War, where the United States, like a behemoth awakened from slumber, crushed its southern neighbor, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. The echoes of that war still lingered, a miasma of resentment that seeped into the marrow of their shared blood.\n\nThis was not an isolated anomaly, for it is in the nature of nations to clash, their borders a razor's edge between rivalries and disputes. The United States and Mexico were not alone in their animosity, their shared border a catalyst for the simmering embers of discord. David M. Pletcher's words echoed through the ages: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations, their shared geography a constant reminder of their entwined fates, only served to fan the flames of their rivalry.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute lay the festering wound of religious differences, a chasm that yawned between the two nations like a great abyss. Sally Frahm's words spoke to the very soul of this divide: \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was as if the two nations were locked in an eternal struggle, their ideologies clashing like titans, each side convinced that its own way was the only path to salvation. And yet, this was not merely a matter of politics, but of faith, a deeply ingrained distrust that seeped from the very foundations of their history.\n\nThe distrust between the English and Spanish, those distant forebears, had left an indelible mark on the nations that succeeded them. The United States and Mexico, inheriting this legacy of animosity, stumbled through the early years of their relationship, their steps faltering as they navigated the treacherous waters of their shared past. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes between 1836 and 1893 stood as a testament to the depth of their enmity (2000, p. 145). It was a litany of territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier problems, each confrontation a reminder of the festering wound that lay between them.\n\nYet, as the years passed, the United States and Mexico began to realize that their interests were not mutually exclusive. Schmitt's words spoke to the turning point in their relationship: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109). And with this dependence came a shift in the dynamics of their rivalry, as the United States' ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). It was a slow-burning fuse, but one that would eventually lead to the end of their long and bloody rivalry.",
            "It was a slow unraveling, the threads of my life fraying like the tattered edges of a worn quilt. Fifteen years past, a sudden and inexplicable darkness took hold, a sickness that consumed me whole. I was a nurse then, one who had chosen that path for the promise of security it offered, a refuge from the uncertainties of my own childhood. The words of my elders still echoed in my mind, \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I put aside my dreams, my desires to be a scientist, to be a journalist, and I dedicated myself to the noble work of caring for others.\n\nBut now, as I sit here, my body worn down, my prospects diminished, I am left with nothing but the faint memories of a life once lived. Fifteen years of living on the precipice, clinging to the fragile thread of Social Security Disability, I am a shell of the person I once was. Every day is a battle, a fight for survival, for security, for self-respect. And yet, amidst this abyss, there is one truth that haunts me still. I could not have endured without the kindness of strangers, the selfless acts of those who saw beyond my frailty and reached out to help.\n\nIt is a lesson that has stayed with me, a truth that I cling to in the dark hours of the night. In the face of disaster, we are never alone. We are sustained by the love and compassion of those around us. And so I urge you, do not place all your trust in the crumbling edifice of government. Learn to trust one another, to rely on the kindness of strangers, to ask for help without shame.\n\nFor it was not the rugged individualism of our forebears that sustained them through the hard times, but the very fabric of community, the threads of compassion and mutual respect that bound them together. The pioneers who crossed the vast expanse of the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but together, as a family, as a community.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have done so, gathering the meager tools of survival: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and the faint promise of a life beyond the ashes. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and waterproof matches, canned goods and the whispered hope of a brighter day. But even these meager supplies would mean little without the knowledge of those who would stand by my side, who would offer a helping hand in the face of disaster.\n\nAnd so, I urge you, do not forget the value of community, of kindness, of compassion. For in the end, it is not the tools of survival that will sustain us, but the love and support of those who stand with us, shoulder to shoulder, in the face of the unknown.",
            "In the depths of existence, a question lingers, a query that gnaws at the very fabric of life: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, like unseen currents in a river, that shape the course of their transformation? Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, dared not attempt to define the simplest of organic forms in mathematical terms. Yet, as the years pass, the pursuit of understanding the intricate dance of evolution continues. Recently, the tools of mathematical modeling have been applied to the mysteries of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the paths of ontogeny and phylogeny like a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mind (Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur own inquiry delves into the realm of the Prunum, seeking to unravel the threads of evolutionary-developmental change through the marriage of mathematical modeling and experimental study. We have employed X-radiographic images to quantify the parameters of Prunum species, which we then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). The resulting models have allowed us to envision hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, casting a light on the boundaries of possible change in this enigmatic clade.\n\nA shell, that most mysterious of structures, can be seen as a tube traversing the expanse of time, its path marked by the revolutions of the whorls. These whorls, like the pages of a book, spiral around an unseen axis, the columella, a central column that gives the shell its form and function. The speed at which the whorls expand can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each whorl from the last. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, the body whorl, while the spire is composed of all the whorls that precede it. The apex, the tip of the spire, and the base, the opposite end, form the extremities of this intricate, coiled structure.\n\nA shell can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the most common orientation. By counting the whorls, we can unravel the secrets of a shell's growth, beginning with the first suture and dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that allows us to chart the path of the aperture as it travels through time and space, carried by the animal's growth.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, a testament to the power of science to illuminate the unknown. By formulating a mathematical model, we can manipulate the variables, varying the parameters of skeletogenesis and exploring the boundaries of possible forms. And so, we continue to explore, driven by the question that has haunted us since the dawn of time: what lies at the heart of evolution, and how do we unlock its secrets?",
            "In the desolate expanse of Indonesia's recent past, the specter of mortality casts a long and unyielding shadow. For a decade, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has hovered, a steadfast sentinel of a nation's unyielding struggle. Like a withered tree, its branches reaching for a sky shrouded in uncertainty, the country's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals falters, its leaves rustling with the whispers of unfulfilled promises. The echoes of a failing healthcare system reverberate, a haunting reminder that the lifeblood of a nation's future hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe statistics tell a tale of woe, a litany of unmet targets and unfulfilled expectations. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled health worker in attendance, yet the presence of traditional healers, with their limited capacity to intervene in the face of complications, belies the very notion of progress. The maternal death toll, a statistic as unforgiving as the earth itself, remains a stark testament to the system's inadequacies. The percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has dwindled, a steady decline in a country where the very fabric of healthcare appears to be unraveling.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate languishes at a paltry four percent, an indicator of the crippling inequities that beset the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Urban areas, the fabled oases of modernity, boast a rate of seven percent, while rural areas, those forgotten bastions of antiquity, struggle to muster a mere two percent. The chasm between the haves and have-nots, a divide as deep as the Grand Canyon itself, gapes wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that threaten to consume the very heart of the nation's healthcare.\n\nAs the country hurtles toward the precipice of uncertainty, the question looms: how to address the yawning chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots? Should Indonesia chart a path of programmatic interventions, a series of targeted solutions designed to tackle specific ills, or should it focus on strengthening the overall healthcare system, a more holistic approach that seeks to address the very foundations of the problem? The answer, much like the future itself, remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nProgrammatic approaches, those siren songs of quick fixes and fast results, beckon with their promise of swift and tangible progress. Yet, like the sirens of old, they come with a warning: the lure of funding and resources, a Pied Piper's call that draws human capital away from other, equally pressing needs. The duplication of services, a cacophony of competing programs, threatens to drown out the very voices of those in need. In this desolate landscape, the question hangs, a specter of a nation's future, poised on the precipice of uncertainty, waiting for the answer that will determine its very course.",
            "The Victorian novels, those labyrinthine tapestries of detail and aristocratic intrigue, often dwindle to mere shadows of their former selves when one encounters the aberrant threads of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like wayward travelers, strayed from the beaten path, embracing the mystique of the unknown and the bizarre, thus imbuing their characters with a depth that would otherwise have remained hidden. It is in the realm of the unexplained, the inexplicable, that their true essence resides, a realm where the fabric of reality is rent asunder, revealing the jagged contours of their inner lives.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the treacherous landscape of his existence, the boundaries between reality and madness become increasingly tenuous. The cacophony of sounds, the kaleidoscope of images, and the bedlam of emotions that assail him are akin to a maelstrom, pulling him under, sweeping him away on a tide of pain and despair. His mind, a maelstrom of conflicting thoughts and emotions, is beset on all sides by the tumultuous visions of Sikes and Crackit, their angry disputations echoing in his mind like a refrain. And yet, even as he struggles to maintain a tenuous grip on reality, the unseen forces that govern his life seem to mock him, leaving him with a sense of powerlessness, a feeling that he is but a pawn in a game he cannot control.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, Oliver's inner world is revealed, a world of pain and fear, of helplessness and despair. His hallucinations, those dreamlike states that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, serve as a window into his soul, a soul battered and bruised, yet still clinging to the hope of a better life. And it is in these moments of vulnerability that we see the true extent of his defeat, the extent to which he has been broken, his will shattered by the cruel hand of fate.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, where time itself seems to have lost all meaning, the day passes, a fleeting moment, a brief, desperate gasp for air in the void. The silence is oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocates, and the hours seem to stretch out before him like a gauntlet, each one a challenge, a reminder of the long, difficult road that lies ahead.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the mystery is woven into the very fabric of the narrative, a thread that runs through the heart of the story, a story of love and loss, of passion and decay. The dreamlike states that pervade the novel serve as a reminder of the fragility of the human psyche, the way in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy can become blurred, and the ease with which the mind can be led astray.\n\nThus, these two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand apart from the rest, their aberrant threads of mystery and the bizarre weaving a tapestry of depth and complexity, a tapestry that rewards close attention, a tapestry that reveals the hidden contours of the human heart.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of memory, the echoes of a long-forgotten time linger, a time when the outlines of a boy's struggle with the English tongue were etched upon my mind like a fresco on a crumbling wall. He was a child of Latino descent, a boy named Adrian, and his troubles with reading seemed a riddle wrapped in an enigma, a cipher that refused to yield its secrets. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others lay still, mute and unresponsive, a language that seemed to defy comprehension.\n\nI was drawn into this mystery, a tutor in the after-school program, tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of his struggles. And it was there, in that fragile nexus of language and learning, that the truth began to reveal itself, like a slow-burning ember glowing to life in the dark. It was not that he couldn't read, but rather that he didn't know the English alphabet, its shapes and sounds a mystery to him, a language that lay beyond his grasp.\n\nThe revelation struck me like a blow, a sudden and profound understanding of the obstacles that lay before him. And in that moment, I knew that I had stumbled upon a truth that would haunt me forever, a truth that would echo in the chambers of my mind like a refrain, a reminder of the fragility of language and the power of understanding.\n\nThe problem of the language barrier in schools, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children, Adrian's story is a testament to its complexity, a reminder that even in the most unlikely of places, a solution can be found. It is a story of the power of compassion, of the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles.\n\nBut what of the many children who struggle with the English language, children who speak it imperfectly, who stumble over its rhythms and cadences? What of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that seem to offer a panacea, a magic bullet that can cure the affliction of language? The dual language system, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a shining example of the power of bilingualism. But it is not a panacea, a silver bullet that can be fired from a distance, a solution that can be applied with ease.\n\nNo, the key lies in the combination, a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding. It lies in the special aids, the tutors, the bilingual educators who can guide the way, who can navigate the treacherous waters of language and learning. It lies in the recognition that language is not a barrier, but a bridge, a connection to the world beyond, a world of possibilities and promise.\n\nAnd so, I speak of Adrian's story, a story of struggle and triumph, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles. I speak of the language barrier, a problem that haunts the halls of learning, a specter that looms over the dreams of countless children. And I speak of the solutions that lie before us, solutions that require a delicate balance of languages, of cultures, of understanding.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own limitations, our own inability to see beyond the horizon, to comprehend the complexity of the world around us. It is our own fear, our own reluctance to adapt, to change. But it is also our own capacity for compassion, for understanding, for empathy. It is our own capacity to see the world through the eyes of another, to hear the whispers of a language that lies beyond our own.\n\nAnd so, let us not be afraid, let us not be hesitant. Let us not be bound by our own limitations, our own fears. Let us instead be open, let us be willing to listen, to learn, to understand. For in the end, it is not the language that is the problem, but our own refusal to see the world in all its complexity, in all its beauty.",
            "In the earliest years of our lives, a notion is sown within us that there is something beyond our mortal grasp. A force, a presence, a power that our small minds struggle to comprehend. Some are led to the hallowed halls of Sunday school, others to the sacred precincts of Temple, while still others search inward for answers that may elude them forever. Many cling to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, while others reject them outright, choosing instead to chart their own course in the dark expanse of existence. The path we choose is a labyrinthine one, winding through the shadows and into the uncertain light of our own perspectives on the divine.\n\nThe evening rain drummed upon the tin roof, a relentless cadence that echoed the turmoil in my heart. My father sat beside me, his eyes lost in the downpour, his gaze a mixture of remembrance and longing. He had grown gaunt, his frame gaunt as the trees that stood skeletal in the winter's grasp. His hair, once a luxuriant mane, now thinned and wisped, like the last wisps of smoke from a dying ember. I felt a shroud of sorrow settle over me, a weight that seemed to crush the air from my lungs. I reached out, my arms encircling him, seeking solace in the warmth of his flesh. We sat together, two figures lost in the rain's melancholy rhythm, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what was to come.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, a bereavement that fell like a dark shroud upon my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, a cruel jest that seemed to mock the very fabric of our existence. I couldn't help but wonder: what manner of God would permit such a fate? I stood alone in the night, my words lost in the void, my thoughts a jumble of anger and despair. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness the end of his life, the moment when the spark that had animated him for so long was extinguished. I wanted to remember the man he was, not the withered shell that remained. My father would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his mortality, to watch as the life that had given me being slipped away into the darkness. I curled into a ball, a fragile, vulnerable thing, and waited for the news that would shatter my world.\n\nBut the silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that smothered me whole. No one called. No one came. I was left to my own devices, lost in a sea of grief, my heart a heavy stone that dragged me down into the depths of despair.",
            "In the grim tableau of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as an enigmatic monolith, a contradictory union of the antique and the modern. As Ian Watt astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this confounding genre embodies the paradox of 'Old-New'. Critics have long disparaged its supposed vacuity, yet extolled its capacity to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto forged the proto-Gothic mode by combining the antiquated theatricality of the past with the novel's nascent innovations. Walpole dubbed this novelistic marriage 'A Gothic Story', a term that encapsulates the union of the 'old' and the 'new' (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre, with its penchant for medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, stands as a testament to the transience of time. Even in Walpole's era, the term 'Gothic' was a catch-all for disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, bespeaking a bygone era deemed antiquated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. Yet, it is this very synthesis of the theatrical and the novelistic that has allowed the Gothic to endure, to become at once anachronistic and rejuvenated for readers disconnected from its original context.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic lies the concept of Chivalry, an idealized paradigm of the medieval knight, representing honor, valor, and competence. This chivalric ethos, embodied in characters like Frederic, serves as a foil to the perceived moral decay of the present. Walpole, writing in a period of turmoil, likely saw in the Gothic era a lost innocence, a morality he felt was absent in the society of his time. His novel, therefore, becomes a lament for a bygone era, one in which chivalry and honor reigned supreme. Frederic, with his noble lineage, sufferings, and supposed martyrdom, exemplifies the chivalric ideal, albeit with an excess that foreshadows the Gothic trope of hyperbole.\n\nIn the labyrinthine corridors of literary history, the Gothic novel remains an enigma, a genre that resists easy categorization. Its marriage of the antique and the modern has allowed it to transcend time, speaking to readers across the ages with a haunting, timeless elegance.",
            "The winding course of goods through the void of the marketplace is a labyrinth of steps, a procession of processes that bend and twist to deliver the desired object to the supplicant's hand. In the dark of 1982, a figure known as Keith Oliver stumbled upon the term that would give shape to this unseen path: supply chain management. A vagabond of industry, Oliver revealed the hidden contours of the supply chain, a terra incognita that wound from the customer's plea to the raw materials, the production, the storage, and the distribution of products to the customer's door. \n\nSix beacons mark the way through this desolate land: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The navigator of the supply chain, the manager, must chart a course through these elements to chart a course for the customer's satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire enterprise is built. It is here that the manager must divine the will of the market, that vast and unknowable force that dictates the customer's demands. Like a sage divining the future from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, the manager must interpret the signs and portents of the market, that they might produce the goods that the customer desires. And once the manager has grasped the customer's needs, they must decide how to meet them, where to produce the goods, and at what scale. The choices are many, and the consequences of error are dire, for every defect, every delay, every misstep can cascade through the chain like a stone cast into a still pond, sending ripples of cost and chaos through the entire system.\n\nSupply, the second element of the supply chain, is the strategic decisions that guide the manager's hand as they navigate the treacherous waters of production. It is here that they must decide which divisions of the company will produce which goods, and whether to outsource to other companies in the pursuit of velocity, that elusive goal of speed, quality, and low cost. The manager must be a master of the unseen, able to thread the needle of efficiency and effectiveness, lest the entire enterprise come crashing down like a house of cards in a gale.\n\nThus, the manager must weave a tapestry of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, a complex dance of threads that must be pulled tight lest the fabric of the supply chain fray and unravel. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of the market, the customer, and the inner workings of the company itself. And yet, for those who succeed in this endeavor, the rewards are great, for they shall be the masters of the invisible web that binds the world together. \n\nIn the retail stores where I once toiled, I saw this dance played out in the details, the uniform, the receipt of shipment, the flow of goods from production to customer. Each step was choreographed, each move a part of a greater whole, a symphony of supply chain management that played out in the quiet moments of each day. And I saw, too, the consequences of error, the confusion and the chaos that arose when the steps were not followed, when the details were not attended to. But when the process was followed, when the steps were executed with precision and care, the result was a symphony of efficiency and effectiveness, a dance of supply chain management that wove together the threads of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information into a seamless tapestry of customer satisfaction.",
            "A faded sign hung crookedly from a pole, a grim announcement in a land far away. Hitler alive, it declared, in Burma's dark heart. Ellen Page stood alone on a street corner, her cardboard placard held aloft like a banner of despair. Burma, a kingdom ravaged by tyranny, a land where the iron fist of a militant junta had crushed the spirits of its people. A place where the drums of protest had beaten out a cadence of defiance, where monks in saffron robes had marched against the darkness, their voices carrying the wind like a mournful sigh. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of hope, had been brutally snuffed out by the guns and bayonets of the regime. The streets ran red with blood, the monasteries lay in ruin, and the foreign press was silenced, their witnesses to the carnage either imprisoned or killed.\n\nBut Burma was not alone in its suffering. The shadow of oppression loomed over every land, a specter of tyranny that had haunted the very dawn of civilization. The early Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing all opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a living deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of modernity and the rituals of the samurai. And in the United States, a land of liberty and freedom, the president held court with a man of God, a man who spoke in tongues of fire and brimstone, his words a litany of hate and intolerance.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square whispered through the ages, their cries of protest muffled by the walls of silence that shrouded the city. The death toll of that fateful night was lost to the ages, a mystery shrouded in the mists of official deceit. But the echoes of the Rwandan genocide lingered, a haunting reminder of the horrors that humanity was capable of inflicting upon itself. And in the depths of the Third Reich, a darkness had descended, a shadow that had consumed the very soul of Europe, leaving nothing but ash and ruin in its wake.\n\nIn this world of darkness, where the light of freedom was but a distant memory, the sign on the street corner seemed a pitiful reminder of the futility of resistance. Yet it stood as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But what was the use of hope in a world where the strong devoured the weak, and the tyrants ruled with an iron fist? The sign seemed a cruel joke, a cruel reminder of the darkness that had consumed all in its path.\n\nEllen Page's eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, a knowledge that the world was a place of shadows and darkness, where the light of hope was but a fleeting dream. She stood there, a solitary figure, a tiny voice crying out in a wilderness of despair. And as the wind rustled her cardboard placard, the words seemed to echo through the ages, a haunting reminder of the human condition in all its brutal simplicity: Hitler alive in Burma, a sign of the darkness that lurked within us all.",
            "The echoing legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz was forged in the crucible of his longevity, a testament to the boundless wellspring of creativity that coursed through him. Like a master craftsman shaping the silences and cadences of his music, Ellington's subtle presence on the piano wove a sonic tapestry that allowed the individual threads of his orchestra to shine forth in all their glory. His compositions were masterful in their ability to provide a framework for soloists to improvise, yet tightly orchestrated to highlight the unique timbres of each player. In this way, Ellington not only showcased the individual talents of his musicians but also imbued his ensemble with a distinctive tone, a harmonic language that spoke to the very soul of the music.\n\nIn his oeuvre, Ellington's mastery of his players' unique voices and the interplay between them allowed him to craft some of the most innovative and sublime works in jazz history. His pioneering use of voice as a jazz instrument, as exemplified in Creole Love Call, was a hallmark of his artistry. This early piece, with its call-and-response structure and six choruses, demonstrated Ellington's ability to elevate the voice to a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. The progression of choruses - from the sweet, melodic call of the first section to the climactic reed-dominated finale - showcased Ellington's skill in crafting a narrative arc that was both subtle and powerful.\n\nIn Creole Love Call, Ellington's innovative use of voice was only one facet of his genius. The piece's carefully crafted structure, with its call-and-response patterns and solos, underscored the importance of texture and timbre in his music. Each chorus was a masterclass in tone color, with the voice, reeds, and brass sections weaving together in a rich and intricate tapestry. The piece's climax, with its syncopated stop-time rhythms and soaring reed melodies, was a testament to Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz expression.\n\nEllington's later works, such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), further demonstrated his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color. In these pieces, he skillfully combined the vocal and instrumental elements of his ensemble to create rich, complementary sounds that elevated the music to new heights. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing in Hot and Bothered was a particularly striking example of Ellington's ability to push the boundaries of jazz, while It Don't Mean a Thing showcased his skill in introducing melodies on muted trombone.\n\nIn Ellington's music, the voice was not just a instrument, but a metaphor for the very essence of jazz itself - a fluid, expressive, and ever-changing entity that could be molded and shaped to evoke the deepest emotions and experiences of the human condition. His legacy, like the music itself, continues to resonate with us, a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that defined his artistry.",
            "A want gnawed within her like an unquiet thing. It had begun when she was a girl, fourteen and just wrestling with the turmoil of adolescent becoming. Three years had passed and the ache persisted, a miasma that refused to lift. She'd narrowed her desires to one thing: a person, a presence to ease the hollow in her chest. Yet, the boys who'd sought her out - and there were some - had failed to stir anything in her. It was as if she'd been a door slammed shut to their gentle knockings. She'd asked herself the same questions, night after night, seeking answers that eluded her like a will-o'-the-wisp in the darkness.\n\nDays at home were a quiet thing, a stillness that wrapped around her like a shroud. Her parents were a calm couple, their arguments rare and usually confined to her assertion of independence. It was as if she'd been forged from a different metal, one that clashed with the gentle temper of her parents. Today was different, though. A scream in the kitchen shattered the peace, and she rushed to the source, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and worry. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushing out in short, desperate breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, her hands trembling as she helped her mother to her feet. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother's hands fumbled for direction, and with a surge of strength, the daughter lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of disinfectant and sickness, a noxious odor that clung to her like a shroud. But she barely noticed, her mind focused on helping her mother. She rushed her to the front desk, calling out for help as doctors and nurses swarmed around them. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her to sit in a waiting room, her mind a jumble of worry and fear. The fall had been from a stepping stool, her mother's attempt to retrieve a vase from the top shelf. It was a trivial thing, a mistake born of haste and distraction. But to her, it was a fracture in the fragile fabric of their lives, a crack that threatened to spread and consume them whole.",
            "In the desolate expanse of existence, where the ravages of time and decay lay bare, a study sought to unravel the secrets of the Mediterranean Diet, that elusive elixir of life. Like a pilgrim's quest, this endeavor aimed to chart the course of fate, tracing the threads of a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" on the tapestry of existence. The aMed diet, a variant of its more storied cousin, the Mediterranean Diet, held promise as a panacea, bolstered by the virtues of plant-based sustenance, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while eschewing the shadows of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of life was allowed, a concession to the frailty of human will.\n\nEchoes of prior studies whispered an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of cardiovascular mortality. A preceding trial had demonstrated the aMed diet's potency in vanquishing the specter of weight gain and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a triumph of science over the capricious whims of fate. Yet, the whispers of prior research had yet to speak to the province of stroke or stroke mortality, a void waiting to be filled.\n\nIn the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were tracked over two decades. The study's authors computed an aMed diet score six times, from 1984 to 2004, harnessing the power of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" to chart the ebb and flow of nutrient intake. The nurses, like sentinels of the health, continued to participate, a testament to the enduring power of human resolve, with more than 95% of the cohort remaining steadfast throughout the study.\n\nEach FFQ, a snapshot of the participants' dietary habits, was scrutinized, validated by the cold light of medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were classified as \"probable,\" a designation bestowed upon about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. The study also accounted for the incalculable variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, as well as the ephemeral quality of leisure-time physical activity, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo temper the vicissitudes of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary habits, the authors averaged the aMed scores from repeated FFQs, a cumulative measure that spoke to the enduring nature of the participants' dietary choices. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, a litany of variables that might otherwise obscure the study's findings.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical construct that pierced the veil of uncertainty, revealed the association between adherence to the aMed diet and the specter of CHD and stroke. The results spoke to a higher aMed diet score, a badge of honor that conferred a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke on the women who bore it. Over the 20-year span of the study, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. The women who inhabited the realm of the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the aMed diet's enduring power to shape the course of existence.",
            "The ruin that had befallen the land was like a slow-moving shadow, creeping across the once-green fields of the economy. It began in the year of 2007, when the United States, that great behemoth of industry and progress, stumbled into the darkness of a crushing financial crisis. The towers of commerce, once proud and unyielding, now crumpled like fallen spires, their shattered remnants strewn across the barren landscape like the bones of some great beast.\n\nIn those days, the winds of recklessness howled through the corridors of power, whispering sweet nothings to the ears of the mighty. Selfish and naive, the politicians of the time, driven by a hunger for power and a lust for the praise of the masses, cast aside the wisdom of the ancient ones, and instead chose a path of destruction. They pressured the great banks and corporations to issue forth a multitude of sub-prime loans, like so many poisonous seeds, scattering them across the land like a plague. And the loans, like a noxious weed, sprouted forth, entwining the very fabric of the economy, strangling its lifeblood.\n\nFannie Mae, that mighty behemoth of finance, and its sister, Freddie Mac, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these rotten loans, like so many diseased carcasses, into the complex structures known as CDO's and CDS's. And when the borrowers, like so many leaves before a hurricane, defaulted on these loans, the banks, like a diseased tree, began to wither and die. The chaos that ensued was like a maelstrom, sweeping away all in its path, leaving naught but ruin and devastation in its wake.\n\nBut the roots of this catastrophe ran deep, like the taproots of some ancient, gnarled tree. It began in the year of 1999, when the Clinton administration, like a great and foolish king, sought to bolster its popularity by relaxing the lending restrictions that had once held the banks in check. And thus, like a slow-moving poison, the seeds of destruction were sown, waiting to sprout forth in the years to come.\n\nThe great Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, had foreseen the consequences of this folly, writing in the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He had seen the writing on the wall, and had warned of the coming storm, but his words fell on deaf ears.\n\nAnd so, like a great and mighty river, the economy flowed headlong into the abyss, its waters churning and foaming with the complex structures of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The households of America, like so many ships on a stormy sea, were over-leveraged and vulnerable, their very existence threatened by the slightest change in the tides of the market.\n\nAnd then, like a great and terrible reckoning, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, like so many great and mighty beasts, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. And in the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold like so many sacrificial lambs, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation.\n\nFannie and Freddie, those great and mighty twins of finance, were left to face the music, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a heavy burden to bear. And in September 2008, they were placed under the control of the government, like so many wayward children, their future uncertain, their fate sealed.\n\nThus, the financial crisis of 2007 was like a great and mighty storm, a tempest that shook the very foundations of the economy, and left in its wake a trail of ruin and devastation. And though the winds may have died down, the damage remains, a constant reminder of the folly of those who would seek to control the uncontrollable, and the price of hubris.",
            "Exposition is that seductive siren, luring the writer down the rocky shores of narrative with promises of ease and efficiency. But it's a treacherous ally, a subtle thief that steals time from the tale, leaving the reader adrift in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nWe've all been there, caught in the undertow of too much information, our minds numbed by the weight of unnecessary exposition. Dr. Merlin's eyes glaze over as she scans the page, her mind screaming for the writer to show, not tell. The words blur together, a jumbled mess of backstory and history, until she's tempted to shout at the screen, to wrestle the writer to the ground and demand a more nuanced approach.\n\nExposition is the easy way out, the lazy choice that says, \"Just get this out of the way, and then we can get to the good stuff.\" But the good stuff is precisely what's lost in the telling. When a writer falls back on exposition, they're not only cheating themselves but also their readers, who crave the subtle dance of suggestion, the whispered hints that leave the imagination to fill in the blanks.\n\nConsider the heroine who meets her beloved, only to have the entire sequence of events recounted in a dry, prosaic manner. The reader is left with a hollow feeling, a sense that the story's potential has been squandered on a lazy narrative shortcut. Where are the moments of tender intimacy? The whispered promises? The stolen glances that speak volumes? These are the things that make us care, that make us invest in the characters and their struggles.\n\nIn the best of fiction, exposition is a subtle thing, a whispered aside that reveals character and context without overwhelming the reader. It's the gentle touch that awakens the imagination, allowing the reader to fill in the gaps and become an active participant in the story. Anything more, and we risk losing ourselves in a sea of unnecessary detail, our minds numbed by the weight of too much information.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the siren's song of exposition. It may promise ease and efficiency, but it's a lie. The true magic happens in the spaces between the words, in the suggestions, the implications, and the silences. Leave room for the reader's imagination to breathe, and you'll find that your story comes alive in ways you never thought possible.",
            "He sat in the dark, his eyes fixed on the glowing screen. The news crawled across it like a diseased thing, eating away at the edges of his mind. He watched as the faces of the damned passed before him, their stories a litany of violence and despair. In Columbus, Ohio, a man named Shad Hostettler had committed a heinous crime, his mug shot a twisted mockery of a smile. The news anchor's voice dripped with a false sense of importance, a fleeting concern for the victim's fate, before moving on to the next tale of woe. \n\nA young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, his life hanging by a thread. The SWAT team was on the case, but the details were scarce, the narrative sparse. The anchor's voice faltered, a hesitation in the delivery, a telltale sign that this was a story that didn't quite fit the mold. A black neighborhood, a black victim – a story best left unspoken, or at least, unremarked upon.\n\nThe news continued, a jarring montage of images and voices, each one a reminder of the world's indifference. A gunshot hole in a helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet, a five-thousand dollar reward for information. The anchor's voice rose and fell, a maudlin melody, as the camera panned across the landscape, a desolate expanse of ash and ruin.\n\nAnd then, the stories of the marginalized, the forgotten. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie, the emphasis on his appearance a telling sign of the world's biases.

Within this bond, a cauldron of emotions simmers: the tender warmth of love, the acid sting of jealousy, and the dark stains of cruelty. Brothers see themselves in one another, their own reflections staring back at them like a ghostly apparition. And it is in the depths of desperation, when the world around them is reduced to a desolate expanse, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare. The cost of this knowledge is steep, a reckoning that weighs heavily upon the heart. To gaze into the eyes of a brother is to confront one's own visage, unvarnished and unflinching. In the actions that follow, the true character of the brother is revealed, a tapestry woven from the threads of their shared experiences.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers navigate this treacherous terrain, their journey a futile quest through a landscape as beautiful as it is unforgiving. The bitter disappointment that festers within them is a palpable thing, a wound that sears the soul. And yet, it is in the crucible of this emotion that pride is tempered, a double-edged sword that cuts both ways.

He recalls the dark thought that had crept into his mind, a monstrous impulse to silence Doodle's fragile voice forever. And yet, it is in the brief, shining moment when Doodle smiles that his conviction wavers, a fleeting glimpse of a love that has been hidden beneath the surface all along. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a brother forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own making.\n\nThe bond between brothers is a thing of unyielding ferocity, a bond that cannot be broken. It is a crucible, a testing ground where the very fabric of their existence is forged.

            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the human mind, a complex tapestry of creative information weaving unfolds. As the fabric of technology has evolved from its primordial threads to the intricate patterns of the modern era, so too have the metaphors that sought to describe the brain's mysterious workings. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, a blank slate awaiting the inscription of thought. Then, like a papyrus scroll, it was seen as a surface upon which the ink of experience was poured. The book, a vessel for the collected knowledge of humanity, came next, its pages dog-eared and worn from the weight of understanding. And now, in our era of wonder, it is likened to a computer, a device that processes information with the cold efficiency of a mechanical heart.\n\nBut even as we employ these metaphors, we must be mindful of their limitations, lest we succumb to the pitfall of erroneous conclusions. For the brain is a far more wondrous and intricate machine than any of these analogies can hope to capture.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs, those gatekeepers of the physical world, which transmute the raw data of the universe into electrochemical signals. These signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are swept up and transformed by the brain's algorithms, both from below and from above. Bottom-up processing, like a river flowing downhill, gathers disparate threads of information and weaves them into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, on the other hand, like a master weaver, uses the fruits of this labor to guide the recognition of patterns and meaning.\n\nAs the information is processed, an attention filter, like a skilled editor, sifts through the detritus of the mind, deciding which signals are worthy of notice and which may be discarded. And though the brain may process every blade of grass beneath our feet, it is the attention filter that allows us to pick out our name, spoken in a cacophony of noise.\n\nThe brain's storage facilities are a labyrinth of memory, with multiple compartments for sensory, working, and long-term information. Information is encoded, like a letter inscribed on a parchment, in various ways depending on the type of sensory stimulus it has received. Verbal input, for example, may be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like a message written in different alphabets.\n\nBut how is this information maintained? Studies of the animal kingdom suggest that working memory, that fleeting repository of information, is sustained by an electrical signal that loops through a series of neurons like a whispered secret. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be anchored in the very fabric of proteins, like a ship's anchor in the bedrock of the sea floor.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery that has been approached from multiple angles. Some models are based on the way humans retrieve memories, like a map of a forgotten city. Others are drawn from the realm of computer science, where algorithms and data streams weave together to form a tapestry of understanding. And still others are derived from the study of neurophysiology, where the intricate dance of neurons and synapses is observed in all its glory.\n\nThe semantic network model, like a great spider's web, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" may be linked to \"table,\" which in turn may be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But even as we seek to understand the brain's workings through these metaphors and models, we must remain aware of their limitations, lest we become entangled in the very web of our own making.",
            "The scorching critique of technology and the capitalistic underbelly that nurtures it can be seen in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World. The author's scathing indictment of a society that values community above the individual, and immediate gratification above all else, is a searing rebuke of the excesses of modernity. The people, reduced to mere automatons, are conditioned to pursue happiness with a single-minded ferocity, their minds numbed by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and desire.\n\nAs one peers through the lens of Marxist thought, the underlying suspicions of Huxley's critique become apparent. The novelties of modernity - the homogeny of thought, the reification of human experience - are revealed as a cleverly constructed snare, designed to ensnare the unwary in a web of false consciousness. The common citizenry, conditioned to pursue their own selfish interests above all else, are naively unaware of their true position in the grand scheme of things. They are pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, their motivations reduced to a simplistic calculus of gain and pleasure.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, achieved through the ubiquitous use of hypnopædia, is a masterstroke of ideological control. The lower classes, reduced to a state of mindless conformity, are oblivious to the manipulation that surrounds them. They are trapped in a cycle of consumption and desire, their wills reduced to mere automatism. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, are equally complicit, their actions a mere ratification of the existing order.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are a sterile, hollow thing, devoid of depth or meaning. The characters exist in a state of suspended animation, their emotions reduced to a series of shallow, affectless interactions. The novel's refusal to distinguish between characters is a powerful commentary on the dehumanizing effects of modernity. Love, passion, and creativity are absent, replaced by a lifeless, soulless existence.\n\nThe complacency of each social class in their designated role is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. They are trapped in a never-ending cycle of consumption and obedience, their individuality reduced to a mere abstraction. The novel's portrayal of a society in which relationships are reduced to superficial, transactional exchanges is a stinging indictment of the excesses of modernity.\n\nHuxley's critique of Brave New World is a searing rebuke of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. His novel is a warning, a dire prophecy of a future in which humanity is reduced to a mere commodity, a mere cog in the machinery of consumption and desire. The novel's themes of false consciousness, homogeny, and reification are a powerful indictment of the excesses of modernity, a rebuke to a society that values the superficial above the profound.",
            "I've spent nigh on two and a half years wandering these hallowed halls, or rather, navigating the labyrinthine paths that crisscross our campus. For many, including myself, the simple act of traversing this sprawling landscape can be a Sisyphean task. My freshman year, I found myself consigned to a dorm room in the distant reaches of East Halls, a bastion of solitude that seemed as far removed from the thrumming heartbeat of campus as the surrounding woods from the concrete canyons. The trek from my Stuart Hall abode to the far-flung Willard building, that stalwart sentinel of academic rigor, could stretch on for a quarter hour or more, a seemingly interminable expanse of tarmac and pavement that seemed to stretch out before me like a vast, gray sea. Weathered skies and biting winds only served to slow my progress, casting a pall of despondency over the entire endeavor.\n\nBut I have since learned that this was not always so. In days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood as an island, a self-contained bastion of student life, shrouded in a sea of untamed wilderness. The intervening years have seen this empty expanse transformed into a veritable cornucopia of athletic fields, gleaming edifices, and sleek, modern dwellings. The campus, it seems, is forever in flux, a living, breathing entity that shifts and morphs before our very eyes. And with this metamorphosis comes a growing sense of dislocation, a disorientation that threatens to engulf us all.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, I find myself drawn to the humble bicycle as the solution to our mobility woes. But, I dare say, it is not the bike itself that holds the key, but rather our willingness to ride it, to harness its power and channel it towards our collective betterment. The campus, too, must be reshaped in our image, its corridors and thoroughfares designed with the bicycle in mind. Only then can we hope to reclaim our place within this ever-shifting landscape.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who, after a several-year hiatus, has once again taken to the saddle. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"but for a few years, it just wasn't cool to ride a bike. But it's the only way to get around.\" And I find myself in fervent agreement. Not only does cycling offer a modicum of physical exercise, but it also represents the most efficient means of traversing this sprawling campus. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a brief exertion can carry me 30 miles or more, leaving me with the time and energy to pursue my studies unencumbered.\n\nI, too, have found myself forced to navigate the treacherous expanse of Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building from my off-campus abode. The road itself is a gauntlet, a gauntlet that demands focus and fortitude from those who dare to traverse it. But with my trusty steed by my side, I am able to shave precious minutes from my daily commute, cutting the 25-minute walk down to a mere 5 minutes. And though walking has its own merits, I fear I am too beset by the demands of academia to indulge in such leisurely pursuits. Were it not for my bicycle, walking would be my sole option, a Sisyphean task that would drain my time and energy, leaving me drained and spent.\n\nAnd so, I implore our campus leaders to reconsider the needs of the bicycle, to recognize its potential as a unifying force, a thread that weaves our disparate paths together into a tapestry of shared experience. For in embracing the bicycle, we may yet find a solution to the problem of mobility, a solution that will carry us forward, into a brighter, more vibrant future."
