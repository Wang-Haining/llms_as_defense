            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

It is here, amidst the bleak landscapes of abuse and neglect, that I aspire to offer solace and support to the innocent, to be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. \n\nIn this dismal tapestry, I bring with me the threads of service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships and the sharpening of my own professional edge.

For years, I wandered, lost in the wilderness of my own aspirations, uncertain of the path that lay before me. It was not until I chanced upon a friend, her home a sanctuary from the tempests of the world, that I encountered a young soul, torn asunder by the tumult of his own family's dysfunction. And it was in that moment, as I beheld the anguish etched upon his face, that I knew my calling, my raison d'être.\n\nThe events that transpired subsequent to that fateful encounter only served to solidify my resolve. The parents, a pair of towering phantoms, their faces shrouded in deceit and malice, seemed to recoil from the very notion of accountability, their words a tangled web of excuses and half-truths.

I wore my heart on my sleeve, my colors bold and unapologetic, my voice a clarion call to action.\n\nAnd it is this same spirit, this same fire that burns within me, that drives me to pursue a career in social work, to challenge the status quo, to be a champion of social justice.

            "The desolate landscape of slumber stretched before us, a vast and unfilled expanse of darkness. It was a terrain scarred by the scourge of insomnia, a disorder that left its victims stranded, lost and unmoored in a world of perpetual wakefulness. The biological model, with its cold and unforgiving logic, reduced this affliction to its constituent parts: genes and heritable factors, the physiologic underpinnings of a slumber that refused to come. Like a barren and unforgiving land, the hypothalamus, that most ancient and mysterious of organs, held sway over the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. And within its depths, the neurons, like sentinels of the night, guarded the gates of Morpheus, their delicate balance tipping the scales between repose and unrest.\n\nThe study of mice, those tiny, inscrutable creatures, had revealed a hidden order, a phenomenology of slumber and wakefulness that was both wondrous and terrible. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like unseen hands, reached out to grasp the threads of sleep, to weave a tapestry of rest and rejuvenation. And when these receptors faltered, or failed, the very fabric of existence was rent asunder, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered lives and broken dreams.\n\nThe sociocultural models, with their plaintive cry of environmental determinism, beckoned us to consider the world beyond the narrow confines of the individual. Like a vast and mysterious sea, the collective experience of humanity stretched out before us, a maelstrom of influences that shaped and molded the human spirit. The inherited phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, whispered secrets to us of a past long forgotten, a past that shaped the contours of our present. And the sociocultural models, like wise and ancient sages, counseled us to heed this whisper, to listen to the hidden rhythms of the human heart.\n\nIn the dark and dusty recesses of the human experience, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that twists and turns like a serpent through the underbrush of our collective unconscious. It is a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within. Primary insomnia, a difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, a waking nightmare that haunted the somnambulant hours; primary hypersomnia, a waking world that threatened to consume us whole; narcolepsy, a catatonia of the will, a surrender to the void; breathing-related sleep disorder, a gasping for air in a world that seemed to suffocate us; circadian rhythm sleep disorder, a disordered clockwork, a world gone mad.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this chaos, there is a glimmer of hope, a light that flickers like a candle in the wind. For in the study of these disorders, we find a glimmer of understanding, a hint of a language that speaks to the very heart of our humanity. The GABAB receptor, that mysterious and elusive entity, held the key to this understanding, a key that unlocked the doors of perception, revealing the hidden workings of the human brain.\n\nBut what of the sociocultural implications of this study? What of the world beyond the laboratory, the world that lay shrouded in the mists of uncertainty? The answer, like a ghostly presence, haunted the edges of our perception, a presence that whispered secrets to us of a world in which the biological and sociocultural models intertwined like the threads of a tapestry. A world in which the phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, shaped the contours of our present, a world in which the very fabric of existence was woven from the threads of our collective experience.\n\nAnd so, we return to the starting point, to the desolate landscape of slumber, to the biological and sociocultural models that stretch out before us like a vast and unforgiving expanse. It is a terrain that is both familiar and strange, a world that is at once both our own and yet utterly alien. And in this world, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within.

It is a condition where the very fabric of perception is rent asunder, leaving the sufferer lost in a world of discordant sounds and muffled whispers. Like a traveler in a barren wilderness, one must navigate the uncharted territories of diagnosis and understanding.\n\nThe earliest whispers of CAPD's presence can be heard in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers first began to study the mysterious affliction.

Like a pair of pioneers, they ventured into the unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the human mind.\n\nBut CAPD's manifestations are as varied as the desert sands that shift and swirl in the wind. Some are unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, like a traveler lost in a maze of echoing canyons. Others struggle to distinguish between two or more competing sounds, their ears muffled by the din of the world. Still, others are crippled by the inability to recognize patterns, like a poet struggling to find the rhythm in a sea of discordant notes.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and uncharted territory. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the treacherous landscape of auditory function, using a variety of measures to evaluate the patient's skills. Like a mapmaker charting the unknown, they rely on systematic observation and performance tests to guide them through the unexplored regions of the mind.\n\nThere is no single tool or test that holds the key to unlocking the secrets of CAPD, no compass to guide the traveler through the wilderness of the human experience. Instead, a patchwork of assessments and evaluations must be woven together to form a fragile tapestry of understanding. The patient is presented with a series of auditory stimuli, a cacophony of sounds that must be unraveled like a knot in a rope.\n\nAnd yet, even in the face of this uncertainty, there are those who seek to help. Teachers in mainstreamed classrooms, like beacons in the darkness, can offer a lifeline to students struggling to navigate the turbulent waters of CAPD. With patience, understanding, and a willingness to learn, they can help their students find a path through the wilderness of sound, a path that may be as fragile as a reed in the wind, but one that holds the promise of a brighter future.\n\nAs we venture into the unknown, we must remember that CAPD is a disorder of perception, a condition that affects not just the ears, but the very fabric of our understanding. Like a traveler in a strange land, we must be willing to listen, to seek out the whispers of understanding, and to follow the faint trail of clues that lead us deeper into the mystery of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the tools or the tests that hold the key to understanding CAPD, but the willingness to listen, to seek out the hidden patterns, and to chart a course through the uncharted territories of the human mind.",
            "In the masquerade of Twelfth Night, the duplicity of disguise seems a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows for the perpetuation of deception, a shield to deflect the cruel hand of fate. Yet, it is a fragile bulwark, one that must eventually be shed lest the soul be lost to the void. The problem lies not in the shedding of the disguise, but in the cost of stripping away the veil: the risk of alienation, of severing ties with those who have come to know us in our falsehood.\n\nThe subject of deception, particularly in the realm of gender role reversal, raises complications of its own. It is a tangled web, with each strand a knotted consideration. Why do we don the guise of another? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as in Viola's case, where the misty veil of the unknown demands a transformation to safeguard her very existence? As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in doing so, she cuts herself off from the support of her own sex, a severance that would test the mettle of even the strongest heart.\n\nIn the cold light of Illyria, Viola's ruse is so convincing that it breeds confusion, her identity subsumed by the newcomer Sebastian. Olivia's affections are torn asunder, like a thread pulled from its weft, as she falls prey to the mistaken ardor, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, the nascent feelings between Viola and Orsino remain unspoken, a subterranean current that threatens to burst forth in the unlikeliest of moments, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nYet, it is in the guise of Cesario that Twelfth Night reveals the latent desires of its characters, a subtext that whispers of unrequited love and hidden longings. Olivia's switch of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her gentle regard for Viola as sibling, seems a jest, a send-up of the societal norms of the time. It is a jest that belies a deeper truth: that our desires are as multifaceted as the masks we wear.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a question: what lies beyond the veil of deception, the hidden self that we dare not confront? Is it a truth that sets us free, or a prison from which we cannot escape? The play holds its answer close, a secret known only to the playwright's pen.",
            "The shadows of colonialism lay heavy over the vast expanse of German rule, its brutal visage most starkly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, this bleak portrayal cannot encompass the full scope of a colonial empire as multifaceted as the German. Educational provision, like the empire itself, was a tapestry woven from diverse threads, each one distinct in its fabric and hue. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational efforts were lauded by contemporary scholars.\n\nMeanwhile, in South West Africa, a stark contrast unfolded. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of the native population, the task of educating the Ovaherero and Nama was left largely to the mission societies, their efforts woefully underpinned by the colonial authorities. The government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and bolstering the missionary schools with patronage and regulation. These policies bore lasting consequences for South West Africa, even after the dissolution of German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where the African population had made significant strides in literacy and education, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The confluence of various social, political, and economic factors gave rise to this divergent experience, and this paper seeks to shed light on these underlying forces, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nA vast literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, most of which is rooted in German and dates back to the era of German colonial rule. These early works focused primarily on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the striking differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A seminal work in this regard is Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of the two colonies, underscoring the factors that contributed to their divergence. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nGeography played a crucial role in shaping the German colonial experience, particularly in South West Africa. The colony's moderately temperate climate belied its arid desert expanses, which covered a substantial portion of the territory. The European population of South West Africa, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, was a direct reflection of the region's relatively hospitable conditions. In stark contrast, East Africa, with its next largest settler population, harbored only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The darkness that defined it, like a shadow cast across the land, stretched out before them like a canvas of endless possibility. Over the past century, the classifications of popular music had grown like a twisted, gnarled tree, its branches heavy with the weight of countless sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. And at its dark, twisted heart lay the behemoth of Heavy Metal, a creature that had burst forth like a screaming, fiery apparition from the very depths of the earth.\n\nIt was a music of excess, of more – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. A sound that shook the very foundations of the soul, like the rumbling of thunder on a summer's day. And yet, it was also a music of precision, of chops, of musicians who wielded their instruments like masters of a dark, ancient art. The influence of psychedelic drugs, like a whispered incantation, had seeped into the marrow of the genre, imbuing it with a sense of the surreal and the otherworldly.\n\nThe darkness that lurked within was a siren's call, drawing in the lost and the disillusioned like moths to a flame. It was a music of the damned, of the outcasts and the outlaws, of those who dwelled in the shadows and danced with the darkness. And yet, it was also a music of the sublime, of the Romantic Era's dark, visceral qualities, which had been coaxed forth like a ghost from the very depths of the human experience.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, like a bleak, neon-lit neon sign, screamed out into the void, a testament to the darkness that lay at the heart of the movement. It was a cry of rebellion, a challenge to the status quo, a declaration that the Beatles, like a phoenix from the ashes, could rise up and be as heavy, as dark, as the Rolling Stones. And so, the White Album was born, a twisted, mutated creature, a marriage of the dark and the light, of the beautiful and the grotesque.\n\nAs the years went by, the genre continued to twist and turn, like a living, breathing thing, spawning sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like a hydra's head, each one more monstrous, more beautiful, more alive than the last. And at its heart, like a dark, pulsing core, lay the Heavy Metal movement, a behemoth that would not be silenced, would not be tamed, a music that would rage on, like a wildfire, until the very end of time itself.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists unleashed their dreamlike visions upon the world, Henri Rousseau was quietly toiling away, his brushstrokes imbuing his canvases with the essence of his own nocturnal wanderings. The Dream, a painting from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle - a struggle to reconcile the desire for recognition with the need for creative freedom. Like a traveler who ventures into the unknown, Rousseau found himself beset by the same fear of being lost and the same yearning for guidance.\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's biography, a narrative woven from the threads of his own making. Born in the town of Laval in northwest France on a spring morning in 1844, Rousseau was the scion of a family that enjoyed a comfortable, if not extravagant, existence. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, he was denied the formal education that would have provided a clear path forward. Instead, he toiled in obscurity, working as a gabelou for the municipal toll service until the age of forty, his existence a shadowy presence among the bustle of everyday life.\n\nIt was only after the cruel hand of fate dealt him a devastating blow - the loss of his wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children - that Rousseau turned to painting as a means of escape, a way to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Unencumbered by the conventions of his time, he poured his heart and soul into his art, creating works that were raw, unbridled, and unapologetic. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau remained true to his own voice, a voice that spoke of the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world was a Sisyphean task, a task that seemed to weigh heavily upon his shoulders. For, despite his dedication to his craft, he was a latecomer to the world of art, and the likes of Matisse were already making a name for themselves. Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, notes the stark contrast between the two artists - Matisse, driven by a desire to avoid the mundane, and Rousseau, driven by a desire to be accepted by the very establishment he longed to upend. \"Matisse was a painter who recoiled at the thought of painting in a trite way,\" Gordon writes, \"while Rousseau's ambition was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be welcomed into the fold of the Artiste Français.\"\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau's inner turmoil is laid bare, a canvas of contradictions where the desire for recognition and creative freedom wrestle for dominance. It is a painting that speaks to the artist's own personal struggle, a struggle that would continue to haunt him until the end of his days.",
            "In the desolate landscape of existence, some have posited a kinship between the labyrinthine realms of ethics and aesthetics. The affinity between truth and beauty, like the unyielding grip of a winter's night, has beckoned scholars and thinkers for centuries. As John Keats so poignantly etched in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The ephemeral nature of our understanding, gleaned from the crucible of education or experience, bespeaks a deeper, almost primal connection between the ostensibly disparate realms of morality and art.\n\nWe find ourselves drawn to the mysteries of ethics and aesthetics, like moths to the flickering flame of a spent candle, without the need for explicit instruction. These twin pursuits are, in essence, attempts to grasp the ungraspable, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral, rather than to lay down a set of proscriptions or prescriptions. Our analyses of art and morality, though they may delve into the minutiae of style, form, and context, ultimately fall short of capturing the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that sets a masterpiece apart.\n\nConsider the iconic Mona Lisa, for instance. Our discussions of her enigmatic smile may revolve around notions of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these explanations only gesture toward the truth, rather than revealing it. When asked to defend our favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to the enigmatic phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" as if to acknowledge the existence of a transcendent quality that defies capture.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's astute observation, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate,\" speaks to the intransigent nature of art and morality. Regardless of how extensively we catalog the properties of a work of literature, there remains an unbridgeable chasm between our descriptions and the work itself. Ethics, too, inhabits this realm of the unutterable.\n\nAs Wittgenstein so eloquently phrased it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendence, this unspoken essence, that constitutes the most potent bond between ethics and aesthetics. This synergy is especially pronounced in the realm of literature, where the nexus of art and morality is inextricably entwined. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"\n\nLiving, in all its messy, beautiful complexity, is inextricably bound up with values. Literature, that most human of arts, speaks directly to this fundamental aspect of our existence. It is through literature that we find a reflection of our own humanity, with all its attendant virtues and frailties. As we navigate the desolate landscape of existence, it is literature that provides a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is beauty to be found, and truth to be grasped, however fleetingly.",
            "In the shadow of the alps, where the mountains touch the sky, lies a land forged from the fires of disparate cultures. Germany, a nation born of the confluence of ancient tribes and the whispers of a storied past. From the distant echoes of the Baltic Sea's lapping waves to the majesty of the Elbe's gentle flow, the essence of Germany's being seeps from the very marrow of its stones. In the cities of München and Kiel, in Köln's riverine heart and Dresden's Saxon soul, the cultural currents swirl and eddy, a testament to the land's polyphonic heritage.\n\nThe name Germania, a byword for the ancestral home of the Germans, is a mystery shrouded in the mists of time. Scholars and historians debate the etymology of this moniker, some tracing its roots to the Tungrian tribe, others to the spear-like \"ger\" wielded by these ancient warriors. Perhaps, as the Gauls themselves may have whispered to Julius Caesar, it was a term born of their own tongue, a neighborly nod to the fierce and unyielding people beyond the Rhine.\n\nIn the annals of history, the Roman writer Tacitus penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, extolling their unyielding ferocity and aboriginal roots. \"I regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races,\" he wrote, as if to underscore the singularity of their bloodline. But what of those who would seek to leave the warmth of Italy for the unforgiving lands of Germania? Who would brave the tempests and the wilds for a distant, windswept home? Certainly not the Romans, who would send their legions to plunder the riches of Germania, but rarely, if ever, settle among its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes coalesced in the first century, they dwelled on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and their skills, yet refusing to be subsumed by the imperial giant. And so, Germany's story unfolded, a tapestry woven from the disparate threads of history, culture, and the indomitable will of its people.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind vacant, a canvas unblemished by the turmoil that churned within. The scene before me unfolded like a desolate landscape, devoid of meaning or significance. My thoughts drifted, ephemeral whispers that vanished as swiftly as they appeared, leaving naught but the stark, unadorned reality. My consciousness flowed like a dark, uncharted river, unmoored from the anchors of emotion or attachment.\n\nIn a bygone era, I had sought to harness the mysteries of creation, to capture the essence of the world on paper. I had pored over the words of an artist, a sage who had counseled me to grasp the fundamentals of art. He spoke of a world beyond the mundane, a realm where the boundaries of reality were stretched and reshaped. His teachings had led me to The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome that promised to unleash my inner artist. I had devoured its pages, drunk in the secrets of perception and interpretation.\n\nA technique had caught my eye, a simple yet profound exercise: the rectangle of observation. By enclosing a scene within a square frame, one could tame the chaos, reduce the complexities to a manageable whole. I had attempted to apply this lesson to the still life before me, but my mind had faltered, overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of details. The bowl, the fruit, the table, the kitchen, the dining room - all these elements swirled together in a maelstrom of sensory input, leaving me reeling.\n\nYet, even as I stood there, transfixed by the sight, a spark within me ignited. The flame of artistic expression flickered to life, casting a warm, golden glow over the scene. I saw it: Work in Brown, a masterpiece unfolding before my very eyes. My fingers trembled with anticipation as I reached for the pencil, my hand hovering above the page like a bird poised on the branch of a winter tree.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. The respite was shattered by the urgent call of nature. I turned away from the canvas, my hand clenching into a fist as I grasped the handle of the toilet. The offending mass of brown, a detritus of civilization, refused to yield to my will. I flushed, and flushed again, but still it remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence. My hand, now a living thing, jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the recalcitrant mass.\n\nAs I stood there, my knuckles white with frustration, my mind slipped back into its default mode, a state of numbness and detachment. I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of filth and waste, and felt nothing. My gaze drifted to the wall, my hand reaching out to grasp the roll of toilet paper, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos. I clenched my hand into a fist once more, then, with a slow, deliberate movement, dipped it into the bowl, as if surrendering to the void.",
            "In the bleak expanse of American roads, a deadly vector cuts through the youth of the nation. Teenagers, with the fragile weight of inexperience, surrender to the hazards of driving. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth: the teen brain, still in its formative stages, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Simple inexperience, a wanton disregard for the unforgiving laws of physics, and an innate propensity for risk-taking propel the youngest drivers toward calamity.\n\nA study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, like a cold wind through a desolate landscape, reveals a stark correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents occur. The statistics are a stark testament to the treacherous terrain of adolescence, where the siren's call of peer pressure lures the unwary into the jaws of danger.\n\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to stem the tide of carnage with provisional driver's licenses, a stopgap measure that restricts the hours of driving and prohibits minors from riding shotgun. Yet, as a seasoned observer, it is clear that these measures are but a feeble bulwark against the deluge of death that threatens to engulf the youngest drivers.\n\nA more profound understanding, one that acknowledges the inherent limitations of the adolescent mind, is needed. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19 or 20 is too early for the unencumbered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of risk, a siren's call that beckons to the young, must be tempered by the wisdom of experience.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the death toll will continue to rise, a macabre tally that will only deepen with the advent of a new generation of drivers. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's offspring will flood the roads, a tidal wave of inexperience and hubris that will shatter the fragile safety net of existing regulations.\n\nA legislative solution, straightforward and unencumbered by the complexities of bureaucratic red tape, is at hand. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, issued prior to the granting of a full license, can still serve as a stepping stone, accompanied by a requisite number of practical driver's training hours. The specific number of hours, a figure that can be drawn from the experience of existing states (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult), will serve as a benchmark for a generation.\n\nUniform, national legislation on this issue is a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding the nation's youth. This is not a novel idea, but a necessary step in the face of an unfolding catastrophe. The lives of countless teenagers hang in the balance, like autumn leaves on a gusty day. We must not falter in our duty to protect them.",
            "In the dusty stacks of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, I chanced upon a collection of trick films, their numbers dwindling to fifteen from the fleeting years of 1895 to 1901. These short-lived spectacles, born of creative manipulation, relied on the art of editing to weave illusions. My pursuit led me to delve into the poetic underpinnings of the majority of these trick films, as well as the aberrant characteristics that emerged in a few of the later productions. It became apparent that the trick films of the era adhered to a set of strict parameters, their composition relegated to a static frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, reliant upon long and medium shots, and bound by the unyielding rule of one shot equaling one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few of these early films dared to challenge these conventions, introducing novelties such as multiple shots. However, an examination of the trick films as a whole reveals a common thread - their reliance on interior settings, framed by the imposing proscenium arch of the theatre. The camera, unmoving and unyielding, captured the action within this artificial realm, its perspective rooted in the traditions of theatre and vaudeville, where the magic of illusion reigned supreme.\n\nA fundamental limitation of this approach was the restriction it placed on the movement of figures within the frame. They could only traverse the horizontal axis, their trajectory confined to a linear path, never venturing towards or away from the camera. A case in point is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors appear from the right side, their movements confined to a narrow, horizontal plane. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoving and unyielding.\n\nThe static composition of the frontal proscenium also dictated that shots be predominantly long, with medium shots appearing only sporadically. Close-ups, a staple of later cinematic storytelling, were an anomaly in these early trick films, their absence a reflection of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the entire performance was presented within the frame of the stage. Actors remained fixed in the middle ground, their movements never drawing them towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating a single film, a constraint that limited their length to a mere minute or less, depending on the frame rate employed. This restriction stifled the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which predominantly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching illusions, bereft of a coherent story. However, a closer examination of these trick films reveals that a single \"shot\" may actually comprise multiple physical shots, expertly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that, upon closer inspection, reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a long-forgotten past, a figure emerged, his name etched in the annals of history - John Taylor of Caroline. A stalwart advocate for the Republican creed, his fervor burned with an unyielding passion for the principles of personal freedom and limited governance. Though his roots lay in the fertile soil of agriculture, his forays into politics sowed the seeds of a man unyielding in his convictions. His dedication to the agrarian way of life was the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were forged.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the chains of native tradition, Taylor believed the United States held the promise of crafting an ideal system, one where self-government could flourish unencumbered. He espoused the natural rights of man, arguing that they were inextricably linked, that the denial of one right would imperil the others, rendering them worthless. These rights, he contended, must remain beyond the grasp of the government, untainted by the rot of despotism.\n\nTaylor's worldview was predicated on a dualistic morality, a stark dichotomy between good and evil. He believed that government, as exercised by man, was susceptible to both virtues and vices. In his estimation, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, nurtured agriculture, and checked the rapacious tendencies of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles would, he argued, function equitably, untainted by the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he averred, was an inescapable fact of human nature, but one that became pernicious only when it gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the weak.\n\nTo prevent the ascendancy of bad principles, Taylor advocated for a government of strict construction, one that operated within the narrow confines of the Constitution's explicit provisions. He shuddered at the prospect of an expansive Federal government, its power and rights unchecked, a potential harbinger of despotism. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, recognizing that such an approach could lead to corruption. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's nature as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "A precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project brought a fleeting sense of unease. The causes behind this decline remained shrouded in mystery, a void to be filled by conjecture and speculation. The creeping onset of winter, with its wintry grasp on the New England campus, may have contributed to a decline in commutes by bicycle or foot. The hectic end to the fall semester, when students were consumed by the final throes of schoolwork and the inevitable processing of grades, may have also played a part. The holidays, a month-long respite from the demands of academia, further siphoned off interest, leaving the commuter log to gather dust on a forgotten shelf.\n\nA growing awareness of the cyclical nature of project momentum crept into our thoughts - a burst of energy at the outset, followed by a natural decline. We endeavored to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a concentrated effort to revive the initiative in March. Though it yielded a temporary increase in log submissions, it begged the question: how to sustain momentum in the face of inherent fluctuations. The problem of holiday and semester breaks, a recurring affliction for higher education, presented a particular challenge.\n\nA more insidious foe, however, lay at the heart of our struggles: the deeply ingrained notion that personal freedom, independence, and flexibility are inextricably linked to the freedom to drive. A cultural paradigm, stubborn and resistant to change. We attempted to counter this with incentives - gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. Yet, a nagging doubt persisted: could we have done more to combat the decline? Would larger, more substantial prizes - a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car - have been the catalyst for increased participation? The allure of these prizes, announced in December and January, may have been enough to rekindle interest and spark renewed engagement.\n\nThe prizes, however, remained static throughout the project. A gentle wind, blowing softly at the outset, gradually lost its force, failing to sustain the momentum we had worked so hard to build. If only we had announced a series of escalating incentives, each one more tantalizing than the last, perhaps our efforts would have borne fruit. Alas, the gift cards, once sufficient, gradually lost their luster, unable to stem the tide of waning interest.",
            "In a world where the markets roamed like a barren wasteland, a creature emerged - the ETF, a security born of human ingenuity, designed to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets like a beast tracking its prey. It was a creature of flexibility, trading like a stock on an exchange, yet offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership. The ETF's allure was palpable, a siren's call to the savviest of investors, promising the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.\n\nYet, like the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world, there existed a darker side to the ETF, a reminder that even in a world of abundance, there were costs to be paid. The expense ratios, a barren wasteland of fees, stood as a testament to the ETF's true nature. And so, the investor must navigate this landscape, weighing the benefits of diversification against the costs of commissions, a constant reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can turn out to be a pitfall.\n\nThe ETF IHF, a particular specimen of this breed, held within it a secret: its top 10 holdings, a diverse assemblage of assets that comprised 63.58% of its assets. Like a treasure trove hidden deep within the ruins of a forgotten city, these holdings held the key to understanding the ETF's true nature. By examining the top 10 holdings, one could gain insight into the ETF's very essence, and perhaps, uncover a hidden truth - that the benefits of owning a single ETF might not be as great as they seemed.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of the ETF IHF, one must first evaluate its holdings, a task akin to navigating a treacherous landscape. By using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, one could estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations, a complex dance of numbers, revealed a startling truth: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings could provide a 6.11% higher return, a 16% increase in returns, compared to the ETF as a whole.\n\nBut like the fragile balance of the post-apocalyptic world, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was 0.12 lower than the ETF's, a delicate balance that could be easily upset. The question remained: were these portfolios statistically different? To answer this, one must delve into the realm of standard deviation, a measure of the variability of returns. By determining the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalizing it to 100%, one could compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.\n\nAs the sun set on this desolate landscape, the investor was left with a choice: to venture forth into the unknown, or to retreat to the safety of the familiar. The ETF IHF, like the post-apocalyptic world, was a place of wonder and terror, where the benefits of diversification and flexibility beckoned, but the costs of commissions and fees lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike. Only time would tell if the ETF IHF would prove to be a savior or a curse, a creature of the market that would lead the investor to prosperity or destruction.",
            "In the depths of his fevered imagination, a realm of shadows beckoned, one that Edgar Allan Poe had all but claimed as his own, a place he called Dream-Land. It was a world born of his darker musings, a twisted tapestry woven from the threads of his own tortured soul. And in this desolate landscape, a word echoed, a word that would serve as a harbinger of his descent into the abyss: Thulé.\n\nPoe's fascination with this term was not born of the void, but rather from the influence of a master wordsmith, the German bard Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe's own works, particularly the poetic drama Faust, had left an indelible mark on Poe's psyche. It was in Faust's second part, a somber and mournful tale, that Poe would find the germ of his own creative seed. A poem, \"The King of Thulé\", told the tragic tale of a king who, bereft of his beloved wife, succumbed to the darkness, his spirit shattered by the memories of his lost love.\n\nIn this twisted doppelganger of his own loss, Poe would find a kinship, a reflection of his own mortal coil. The King of Thulé's descent into madness, his drinking and despair, mirrored Poe's own struggles with the demon of addiction. And it was in this same work that Poe would find the term Thulé, a word that would become the leitmotif of his own dark musings.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" was no mere happenstance. It was a deliberate nod to Goethe, a acknowledgement of the debt he owed to the German master. And in \"Dream-Land\", the landscape of Thulé was a twisted reflection of the King's own desolate realm, a world devoid of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nIt was a testament to Poe's reverence for Goethe that he would draw inspiration from the German's works, weaving them into the very fabric of his own creative tapestry. Poe's admiration for the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was well-documented, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his psyche. The echoes of Thulé, a word born of Goethe's imagination, would haunt Poe's own, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within, waiting to consume him whole.\n\nIn the end, it was not the void that had spawned Dream-Land, but the creative ferment of Goethe's genius, a wellspring of inspiration that would fuel Poe's own descent into the abyss. And in the shadows of Thulé, Poe would find a reflection of his own mortality, a grim reminder that the darkness was always present, waiting to claim him whole.",
            "In the shadow of California's statutes, a question lingers: can a customer, injured by the negligence of a grocery store, claim punitive damages against the store's manager, who, informed of a spill, chose not to act, distracted as he was by the mundane act of eating dinner? The judge, a sentinel of justice, is unlikely to dismiss the claim summarily. To grant punitive damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable, an affront to the very notion of decency.\n\nJennifer Palmer's claim, though precarious, is not without merit. She can argue that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of neglecting to clean the spill, given the history of similar incidents at the store. Six slip-and-fall accidents had occurred in the preceding year, and still Martin failed to take action to safeguard his customers. This is not the act of a manager concerned with the well-being of those who enter his store. It is, rather, a callous disregard for the safety of others, a dereliction of duty that can be characterized as despicable.\n\nThe chronology of events is telling. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but Martin, distracted by his dinner, chose to ignore the warning. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same indifference. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of Martin's inaction became apparent.\n\nCalifornia's civil code provides that a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, in this context, is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Id. at § (c)(1). In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979), the court characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, despite the defendant's awareness of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's inaction in the face of multiple warnings of the spill can be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers. His failure to clean the spill, despite the history of similar incidents, demonstrates a callous disregard for the well-being of others. It is a conduct that can be characterized as despicable, a breach of the duty of care owed to those who enter his store. The question remains: will justice be served, or will the manager's negligence be excused? Only time will tell.",
            "Four years past, I had taken a course in the scriptures of Islam at a small university. The disquisitions of our class were often heated, centered around a question that has come to seem more pertinent than ever: can Islam be considered a hostile faith? In the time since the calamity of 9/11, I have observed the mass media shift from a profound distrust of Islam to an almost sycophantic tolerance. A presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, a man whose heritage was deeply rooted in the Islamic faith, was unthinkable in the year 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet has long fascinated me, for it appears to contradict the persona one might expect. I had long believed that Muhammad was a man who forced his will upon others, subjugating tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. Yet, the biography presents a different narrative altogether: that of a man humbled by the trials of his life, a man who was often misunderstood and mistreated by his contemporaries. It was only through his unwavering commitment to his convictions that people began to see the truth in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nThere are eerie parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, which served to feed a company of forty men. The style of writing employed in this account has led me to believe that the authors sought to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in accordance with the truth. This is a kind of fallacy, for it diminishes the true nature of Jesus Christ. It is as if they are attempting to claim Jesus' life and personhood as their own, to usurp his identity and significance.\n\nFurthermore, the biography is replete with stories that seem designed to provide proof of the veracity of Muhammad's teachings. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-person perspective, often through a chain of witnesses. This approach diminishes the stories' impact, making them seem suspect and less credible. The overall effect is one of attempted proof, rather than a genuine attempt to convey the truth.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a position of moral superiority, to portray him as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, the historical record suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was not marked by gentleness or humility. I am compelled to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's ascension to greatness.",
            "Beyond the dusty tomes and the scribes who penned the words, the teachings of Jesus lay abandoned, forsaken in the desert of time. The Christ he had preached, the love he had embodied, the words he had spoken - all these were lost to the ravages of history, consumed by the slow hunger of tradition. And yet, even as the ages passed, a glimmer remained, a faint embers of a fire that once had burned so brightly. For in the depths of the human heart, there was a yearning, a stirring, a sense that something had been lost, that the truth had been obscured by the accretions of dogma and doctrine.\n\nIt was as if the clock of Christian thought had been turned back, the hands unwinding, the gears clicking into reverse, as men and women sought to reclaim the original intent of the founder. A great reversal, a turning back, a stripping away of the extraneous, the unnecessary, the false. The layers of centuries, of dogma, of tradition, would be peeled back, like the tender skin of a fruit, until only the essence remained, the pure, unadulterated essence of the man who had lived, who had walked, who had spoken, who had loved.\n\nAnd when this reversal came, as come it would, to the shores of America, to the heart of Europe, the church would stand, strong and unyielding, a beacon in the darkness, a guide on the path back to the source. But it would not be the same church that had existed before, for theologically, the clock would have turned back, and the diversity that had grown, like a great and sprawling vine, would wither and die, leaving only the branches of a single, unbranching tree, its leaves all alike, its roots deep and unshakeable.\n\nFor in the end, it was not the diversity of doctrine, the multiplicity of interpretation, that had ever truly led to the truth, but the unity, the simplicity, the singleness of purpose. And so, the great reversion would come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a reclaiming of the original intent. It would be a journey, a pilgrimage, a return to the beginning, and when it was done, the world would be still, and quiet, and the only sound would be the gentle rustling of leaves, the soft whisper of the wind through the trees.\n\nBut what happened, in the long unfolding of time, since Jesus walked among men? We must go back, far back, to the Jewish roots, to the soil from which Christianity sprang, to the monotheistic wellspring, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. And we will find, in that far-off time, a people, a people divided, fragmented, at odds with one another - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, a multitude, a sea of faces, each one unique, each one different, each one, in its own way, searching for the truth.",
            "In the festering heart of the city, a grotesque litany of humanity's true nature unfolded. Like a diseased and fest'ring wound, the jungle of Packingtown revealed the base and self-serving inclinations that lay hidden beneath the veneer of civilization. The titans of industry, devoid of compassion, reveled in their pursuit of power and wealth, crushing all in their path with an unyielding fervor. Theirs was a world of unrelenting avarice, where the almighty dollar reigned supreme and the well-being of others was but a distant afterthought.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words dripped like acid, searing the pages with a clear-eyed vision, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The very landscape itself seemed to writhe in agony, a testament to the unfettered greed that had ravaged the land. The owners and managers, devoid of empathy, callously disregarded the lives of those caught in the maelstrom of their machinations, heedless of the noxious plumes of smoke that choked the air or the festering pools of animal waste that polluted the rivers.\n\nTheir indifference to human life was matched only by their callous disregard for the well-being of their employees. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The factory owners and managers reduced their workers to mere commodities, pawns in a game of profit and loss, where the only currency that mattered was the almighty dollar. They worked their employees to the brink of collapse, with nary a care for their safety or well-being, and discarded them like so much trash when they were no longer useful.\n\nThe era of The Jungle was a time when the law was a distant memory, and the powerful preyed upon the weak with abandon. The workers toiled in squalid conditions, their bodies broken and their spirits crushed by the unyielding machine that was Packingtown. There were no safety nets to catch them when they fell, no aid to lift them up when they stumbled. The unions, formed to protect the workers, often served only to line the pockets of those who exploited them. And so, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and suffering, their lives reduced to a mere existence, a living hell of desperation and despair, as Sinclair so starkly described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the epoch of literary craftsmanship, authors have harnessed the power of linguistic tools to inculcate specific emotions and perceptions within their readers. Some techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master of subtlety, employs a range of methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs nouns and adjectives in unexpected conjunctions to create a certain aura around a subject. Fitzgerald also expertly applies significance to symbols, utilizing them to convey profound meaning. He is particularly adept at imbuing colors with emotional resonance, using them to evoke a particular sentiment in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald's manipulation of white and gray is a prime example of this technique. He begins by building a rich tapestry of meaning around these colors, gradually imbuing them with distinct connotations. White, in his narrative, represents a refined, high-class quality, while gray denotes a more aged, faded essence. This dichotomy is evident in the opening chapters, where Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors to create a sense of uniformity. The protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are often clad in white, while characters like Tom and Gatsby are frequently associated with white attire. Even the setting itself is not immune to this color coding, with the \"white chasms of lower New York\" serving as a stark contrast to the gaudy primary colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by assigning these colors to mundane objects and individuals. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, while the names of people at Gatsby's gatherings are reduced to \"gray names\" on his timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" underscoring the idea of uniformity. Even the people and places themselves are not immune to this color coding, with Jordan and Daisy sharing a \"white girlhood\" and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad being described as \"gray.\"\n\nIt is only after Fitzgerald has established this rich tapestry of meaning that he employs white and gray to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, reappears dressed in white in a \"little white roadster.\" This visual cue serves to recontextualize Daisy, transforming her from a complex character to a mere uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald reinforces this interpretation by employing similar color coding around Daisy, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's fateful encounter.",
            "The land on which he stood, scorched by the sun and ravaged by the wind, was a testament to the despair that had consumed all that once lived. And yet, in this desolate expanse, there was a glimmer of hope. San Diego County, a place where the relentless sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, was a land of plenty. The crops that grew there - the tomatoes, the citrus, the leafy greens, and the squash - were a testament to the fertility of the earth. But of all these, the organic farms stood apart, a beacon of resistance against the tide of desolation.\n\nThese farms, tended by the hands of those who toiled in the sun, were a bastion of life. They stood in stark contrast to the barren fields that stretched out before them, a testament to the beauty that could be wrought from the earth. The leafy greens, a verdant oasis in a sea of desolation, were a reminder of what could be achieved through hard work and dedication. The squash, a symbol of resilience, stood tall and proud, its vines stretching out like a lifeline to the parched earth.\n\nBut the organic farms of San Diego County were not without their costs. The labor was intensive, the management a Sisyphean task that required constant vigilance. The pests and weeds, like specters, haunted the fields, threatening to undermine the delicate balance of the ecosystem. And yet, despite these challenges, the farmers persisted, driven by a desire to till the earth and coax forth life from its barren soil.\n\nAs he walked the land, his eyes scanned the horizon, taking in the chaparral, the nonnative grasslands, and the oak woodlands that stretched out before him. It was a land of contrasts, a place where the wild and the domesticated coexisted in a delicate balance. The Cleveland National Forest, a reminder of the power of nature, stood sentinel over the land, a testament to the beauty and fragility of the natural world.\n\nThis was the land that had been chosen, a parcel of 160 acres in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It was a land of beauty and desolation, of life and death, a place where the rhythms of nature still held sway. And it was here that the farmer, driven by a desire to till the earth and coax forth life, stood ready to face the challenges of the unknown.\n\nThe government programs, like a lifeline, stretched out before him, offering a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad. The organic farm, a model of what could be achieved, stood as a beacon of light in the darkness. And the farmer, armed with nothing but his determination and his will to live, stood ready to face the unknown, to till the earth and coax forth life from its barren soil. For in this desolate landscape, there was still a glimmer of hope, a hope that one day, the earth would be fertile once more, and the crops would grow tall and proud, a testament to the power of human endeavor.",
            "Culture is a cipher, an enigma whose meaning shifts with each attempt to grasp it. It is not a fixed entity, but a web of intersecting threads that weave together to form an intricate tapestry. To think of culture as a singular thing, static and unyielding, is to misunderstand its very essence. The notion that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is a reduction of the complex, a simplification that does little justice to the rich nuances of human experience.\n\nWhen we approach a foreign culture, we do so through the lens of our own. We draw comparisons, and in doing so, we risk imposing our own values and biases upon the unknown. To truly understand a culture, one must be willing to listen, to learn, and to embrace the unfamiliar. This is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its existence, its strengths, and its weaknesses. In the realm of negotiation, this understanding is paramount, especially when one finds oneself in a position of weakness.\n\nCulture knows no national borders, nor does it reside solely in the realm of the international. It permeates every aspect of our lives, from the corporate world to our personal relationships. A company's culture can be as rigid as a hierarchical structure or as fluid as a flat organizational chart. It can be seen in the dress code, the communication style, and the hiring practices. Some companies value long hours, while others prioritize work-life balance. Some cultures place great emphasis on saving face, while others value transparency above all else.\n\nAt its core, culture is a web of values, a delicate balance of what is considered acceptable and what is not. A negotiator must be aware of these values, for they will shape the course of the negotiation. If saving face is paramount, a negotiator will avoid public confrontation at all costs. If a hard-driven bargain is the goal, they will not settle for anything less. Understanding these values is crucial, but it is equally important to learn about the individual, to find common ground, and to build a connection.\n\nIn the end, culture is a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions and paradoxes. To navigate its twists and turns, one must be patient, observant, and willing to learn. For it is in the subtleties of culture that we find the key to effective negotiation, a key that can unlock even the most stubborn of doors.",
            "The passage from Psalm 14, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" serves as a foreboding backdrop to our examination of the arguments for the existence of God put forth by St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Like a barren landscape, their thoughts on the divine are scorched by the desolation of doubt, each seeking to illuminate a path to the unknown. We must navigate this desolate terrain, where the weight of their words hangs heavy, to discern whose argument is more convincing.\n\nIn traversing this barren expanse, we find ourselves in the company of Anselm, whose journey begins within the confines of his own mind. He posits that the existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that the proof of the divine lies within the recesses of our own soul. Like a traveler seeking shelter from the storm, Anselm finds solace in the knowledge that the existence of God is not something to be discovered, but rather something to be intuited. The idea that truth can be found within the labyrinth of our own minds is a notion that resonates deeply with the concept of faith, an unyielding conviction that guides the believer through the darkness.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas embarks on a different path, one that traverses the realm of reason and empirical evidence. Like a cartographer charting a new territory, Aquinas seeks to map the contours of the divine through the use of logic and observation. He presents five separate arguments, each one a testament to the power of reason in uncovering the existence of God. The puzzle of existence, with its missing piece, is a metaphor that Aquinas employs to illustrate the inescapable necessity of the divine. Like a master craftsman, he demonstrates that the proof of God is not something that can be seen, but rather something that can be deduced from the intricate web of causality and contingency that governs the universe.\n\nIn the end, it is not our task to declare a victor, but rather to acknowledge the inherent value in each of their arguments. For in the desolate landscape of doubt, their words serve as beacons, guiding us through the darkness towards a glimmer of understanding. Yet, like two travelers on a winding road, we cannot help but feel that their paths converge, each one leading us towards the same destination – a place where faith and reason intersect, and the existence of God becomes a reality that cannot be denied.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a prince was born, one whose name would eventually be spoken in reverence as the Buddha. Beyond the ravages of centuries, his teachings continue to shape the lives of his followers, their essence distilled into the Theravada sect—a tradition forged in the crucible of his enlightenment. Like the dry riverbeds that crisscross the barren lands, the religion has evolved, its waters seasonally swollen by the capricious tides of history. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a testament to the unlikely convergence of the sacred and the mundane. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ritual, their footsteps tracing the forgotten paths of their ancestors, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. The differences that have arisen over the centuries—some say like the shifting sands of the desert—stretch from the surface trappings of tradition to the very bedrock of the faith.\n\nAs the winds of time howl through the Theravada Buddhist community, the doctrine has been shaped by forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These terms will be employed throughout this discussion: internal forces emanating from the very heart of the Buddhasasana, while external forces arise from the outside world, oblivious to the sacred. Hostile forces, like the ravaging storms that sweep across the land, seek to damage or destroy the community, their malevolent intentions fueled by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may be beneficial or detrimental, their impact a byproduct of their actions, like the unpredictable fallout from a distant earthquake.\n\nThe foundation of Theravada Buddhism lies in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and complex edifice, is comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These concepts—Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades existence; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things—are the keys to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, the Samsara that binds us to the wheel of suffering. Alongside Samsara, the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will be extinguished, as one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a code of conduct for laymen and monks alike, five precepts for the former (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), and a more complex set of rules for the latter. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the recognition that attachment fuels suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be vanquished.",
            "Two nations, like ancient adversaries, had long squared off on the stage of the Americas. The United States and Mexico, their rivalry a winding path of contention that meandered through the decades, a 57-year odyssey of discord that finally began to subside just as the world was plunged into the darkness of the Great War. The high-water mark of this antagonism was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, its ambitions sated by the acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe rivalry's genesis lay in the incompatibility of their cultures, their histories and traditions clashing like titans in a maelstrom of conflicting interests. The die was cast, and the two nations were drawn into a vortex of enmity, their mutual distrust fueled by the sullen embers of their colonial past.\n\nAs the years unfolded, their differences coalesced into a rigid dichotomy, a chasm that seemed as unbridgeable as the great divides that scarred the American landscape. Religion, a potent force in this crucible of discord, had become a fault line that rent the two nations asunder. The United States, its gaze fixed on the horizon, saw in Mexico a bastion of Catholicism, a theological monolith that threatened its own Protestant heritage. And Mexico, its eyes cast in the opposite direction, perceived the United States as a scourge, a behemoth that sought to impose its will upon the world.\n\nThe echoes of this animosity resonated through the ages, a refrain that was to be heard in the tumultuous relations between the two nations. The borderlands, a vast expanse of dust and rock, became a proving ground for their rivalry, a battleground where the protagonists clashed in a series of skirmishes and battles that seemed to have no end. David M. Pletcher's words, penned in the twilight of the 20th century, seemed to capture the essence of this enduring enmity: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\"\n\nThe legacy of this rivalry, a testament to the enduring power of historical enmity, continued to cast a long shadow over the relations between the two nations. Even as the world around them changed, the United States and Mexico remained locked in a dance of distrust, their steps choreographed by the residual animosity of their colonial past. And so, like two titans of old, they stood on the stage of the Americas, their rivalry a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of history to shape the destinies of nations.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the disputes between the United States and Mexico accumulated, a tally of 17 recorded conflicts that marked the 57-year span of their rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, the borderlands a flashpoint for their antagonism. Border raids by bandits and outlaws, a perpetual thorn in their side, were a constant reminder of the distrust that had taken root between them. It was only as the United States began to exert its influence over Mexico, its power and wealth casting a long shadow over the latter, that the rivalry began to subside. And when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the stage was set for a new chapter in the complex and often fraught history of the United States and Mexico.",
            "The shadow of illness crept over me like a shroud fifteen years past, its presence a whispered rumor of a life unlived. I was a nurse then, a tendril of stability in a world that had long been unsure. The mantra of safe harbor echoed through my formative years, a refrain that guided me toward a profession that promised solace and security. 'You'll always find work,' they said. People will always fall ill. And so I chose the path of nursing, leaving behind the dreams of science and journalism that lingered like a forgotten melody.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, had other plans. I was 46, single, and bereft of resources, unable to work. The years since have been a grueling dance, a daily struggle to eke out an existence on the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. And though I've survived, the landscape of my life is now a barren expanse, devoid of certainties. The only constant is the knowledge that I owe my very survival to the kindness of loved ones and a few scattered friends. It is a truth that echoes through the desolate chambers of my heart: in the face of disaster, strength is a fleeting illusion.\n\nThis is a lesson that will be etched in my mind forever: in the darkness of true need, our grasp on self-sufficiency falters. The notion that we can weather any storm alone is a myth, a comforting fiction that shatters when the winds of adversity howl. And so, I implore you: let us not be fooled by the siren song of rugged individualism. It was not the unyielding spirit of the pioneers that carried them across the Rockies, but the gentle hand of compassion, the shared burden of mutual respect, and the mutual aid that bound them together.\n\nI am prepared, oh yes. I have a disaster kit, a cache of first aid supplies, water purifiers, and the tools of self-sufficiency. But I know that these are mere trinkets against the tempests that rage. True safety lies not in the solitary vigilance of the individual, but in the collective bond of our communities. Get to know your neighbors, I say. For in their faces, you will find the threads that weave the tapestry of our humanity.",
            "It is a query that has puzzled the minds of men for ages: what drives the evolution of life in the manner that it does? Are there unseen forces that shape the trajectory of change, or are we merely subject to the whims of chance? The answer, much like the world itself, remains shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, who first dared to dream of defining the organic forms of life in mathematical terms, would be astonished at how little we have since progressed. Yet, it is in the darkness of the unknown that we find our greatest opportunity for discovery.\n\nRecently, the application of mathematical modeling to the study of mollusk development has shed new light on the mechanisms of change. In our own research, we have sought to apply this approach to the genus Prunum, combining theoretical models with experimental studies to unlock the secrets of evolutionary development. Through the use of X-radiographic images, we have identified key parameters that govern the shape and form of these creatures, which we have then used to model hypothetical and actual morphologies. Our findings are slowly beginning to reveal the hidden patterns that govern the direction and magnitude of change in this ancient lineage.\n\nA shell, that most fundamental of mollusk attributes, can be seen as a tube that winds its way through the passage of time, a spiral path that traverses the vast expanse of space. Each revolution of this tube is a whorl, a spiral coil that tightens around the central axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls unfold can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each one from its predecessor. The body whorl, the largest and final coil, stands as the crowning achievement of this magnificent structure, while the spire, a towering column of whorls, stretches towards the apex, the tip of this majestic spiral.\n\nShells can be viewed from a multitude of angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each offering a unique perspective on this intricate marvel. And it is in these views that we find the key to understanding the secrets of the shell's growth. By counting the whorls, we can chart the course of the aperture, that opening through which the creature extends its very being into the world. A line drawn from the first suture, a dividing line that splits the shell in two, allows us to estimate the whorls, each one a quarter of a full rotation.\n\nA shell, then, is a path that traverses the void, a journey through time and space that is inscribed on the very fabric of existence. By graphing the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, we can represent this trajectory in all its mathematical precision. And it is here, in this dark and mysterious realm, that we find the power to shape the very course of evolution itself.",
            "In the stillbirths and infant deaths of Indonesia, a stark truth lingers. For ten years, the rates have held fast, like monuments to the country's unyielding struggle. The Millennium Development Goals, a beacon in the darkness, once seemed within reach, but now recede like a mirage on a desert highway. Water and sanitation targets were met, yet child and maternal health lagged, a slow-moving tide of neglect. The reasons are manifold, a labyrinth of complexities that point to a deeper truth: the health system must be strengthened, rather than merely prodded by programmatic interventions.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickers in the statistics. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled attendant, a number that belies the harsh reality. Traditional workers, midwives, stand at the forefront, their aid limited to simple birthing, leaving the complicated cases to a cruel fate. The maternal deaths that follow, like specters, haunt the land. And though the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, the postnatal care remains a dark and foreboding void.\n\nCesarian-section rates hover at a paltry four percent, a meager number that underscores the disparities that ravage the land. Urban and rural settings diverge like two warring worlds, with a seven percent rate in cities and a meager two percent in the countryside. The chasm of equity yawns wide, a chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots. In the poorer quintiles, a 27 percent gap in service utilization gapes like an open wound, a testament to the cruel inequities that afflict the land.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of neonatal and maternal care, the question looms: how to stem the tide of neglect? Should the focus lie on program-specific approaches or on strengthening the health system as a whole, without succumbing to the siren song of targeted interventions? The allure of vertical approaches is great, with their manageable objectives and rapid results. But the drawbacks are equally profound. The funneling of resources to a particular area drains the coffers of others, drawing human resources like moths to a flame. The duplication of services, the cacophony of forms and paperwork, threatens to engulf the system in its own bureaucracy.",
            "In the staid and dusty realm of Victorian literature, a peculiar subset of novels defied the conventions of their time. These works, while bearing the hallmarks of the era, veered into uncharted territories of mystery and the bizarre. Two such novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, exemplified this departure, imbuing their characters with an air of enigmatic complexity. By embracing the unknown, these authors offered a glimpse into the innermost recesses of their protagonists' minds, laying bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the words of Charles Dickens swirled in the darkness, a maelstrom of confusion assailed the mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's bitter dispute still lingered, their voices a cacophony in the silence. The sound of gunfire shattered the air, and the protagonist found himself borne away on a tide of chaos, his senses reeling from the shock. A nagging awareness of pain gnawed at his consciousness, a constant reminder of the turmoil that beset him.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often served as a window into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his sorrow and his nascent understanding of the cruel fate that had befallen him. The shooting that had left him scarred, both physically and emotionally, was revisited in his dreams, a harrowing reenactment of the event that left him shaken and bereft of agency. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscored the sense of powerlessness that had come to define his existence, as if the very fabric of his reality had been torn asunder.\n\nThe passage was a litany of despair, a testament to the crushing weight of Oliver's circumstances. His helplessness in the face of adversity was palpable, a stark reminder that his fate was not his own to choose. The \"unseen hand\" that bore him away was a metaphor for the capricious nature of life, a cruel jest that left him reeling in its wake. As the darkness closed in, Oliver's sense of defeat grew, a sense of resignation that had been sown by the Machiavellian Fagin, who had insidiously eroded his will to resist.\n\nIn the darkness, time lost all meaning. The day succumbed to the night, a fleeting instant in the grand tapestry of existence. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all sense of purpose. Night's darkness was both long and short, a paradoxical existence that seemed to stretch on forever, yet vanish in an instant.\n\nJust as the day dissolved into the shadows, so too did the certainties of life. The unknown loomed, a vast and foreboding expanse that threatened to consume all in its path. And yet, it was in this very uncertainty that the characters of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights found their strength, their bond to the world around them forged in the crucible of mystery and the unknown.",
            "It was a time past, a time not so distant, when I walked among the after-school shadows, a tutor lost in the labyrinth of learning. The Elementary age students, their faces a blur of concern, their minds a jumble of confusion. I wandered through the halls of knowledge, a guide in search of the wayward. My hands, a calloused map of effort, guided the pencils, the books, the minds. The language of the land, a barrier to be bridged. I was recruited by a seasoned instructor to aid a young boy, Adrian, a name that would etch itself into my memory like a cipher on stone.\n\nHe was a boy of Latino descent, a mystery shrouded in the veil of language. His words, a symphony of mispronunciations, a cacophony of misunderstandings. It was as if the very alphabet itself had been turned on its head, its sounds a jumbled mess of confusion. I was stumped, a shipwreck on the shores of his understanding. That was until the day I met his mother, a woman of quiet resolve, her eyes a testament to the struggles she had faced. Her words, a gentle stream of Spanish, a language I struggled to follow, a language that lay beyond my grasp.\n\nThe revelation hit me like a tempest, a storm that ravaged my understanding. Adrian's problem was not one of comprehension, but of alphabet. The English language, a vast and complex tapestry, woven from threads of sound and sight. He knew the words, the meanings, but the symbols that represented them, the letters, these he did not know. It was a chasm, a gulf that separated him from the world of reading. I wondered if this epiphany would be the key to unlocking his potential, or just another stone in the tomb of his struggles.\n\nI share this tale, a cautionary story of the language barrier, a barrier that stands between the promise of education and the reality of understanding. In the hallowed halls of learning, a world away from the concerns of California's schools, I saw the truth. It is not always as obvious as we would think. The solution, a siren's call, beckons to us. But the answer, a will-o'-the-wisp, vanishes at our approach. The dual language system, a beacon of hope, shines bright, but its benefits are not limited to those whose first language is Spanish. It is a gift, a gift that can be shared by all.\n\nBut what of the fears that surround it? The doubts that whisper in our ears, that it is a waste of resources, a luxury we cannot afford? I say, let us not be swayed by these doubts. Let us not be afraid to challenge the status quo. For in the end, it is not the language of the majority that matters, but the language of the individual. And what of the teachers, the educators, the guides who lead us through the halls of learning? Do we require them to be bilingual? No, that would be a task too great, a burden too heavy. But let us not forget the special aids, the tutors, the guides who can bridge the gap, who can speak the language of the heart.\n\nThe key lies in combining the dual language system with the mainstream immersion, the private tutors, the ESL classes. It is a tapestry, a rich and complex weave of solutions, each one a thread in the narrative of understanding. We must not be afraid to experiment, to try new approaches, to push the boundaries of what we think is possible. For in the end, it is not the language that separates us, but our willingness to learn, to understand, to grow.\n\nAnd so, I leave you with this tale, a story of a boy, a boy who struggled with the alphabet, a boy who found his voice in the language of the heart. Let us not forget his story, let us not forget the lessons we have learned, let us not forget the power of language, the power of understanding, the power of the human spirit.",
            "The weight of the unknown settles heavy upon us from the earliest days.  A force beyond our grasp, a presence that defies comprehension.  Some turn to the sacred texts, the dogma of our forefathers, while others seek solace within the labyrinth of their own minds.  We are told to seek the divine, to find meaning in the grand tapestry of existence.  Yet, some reject this notion, choosing instead to chart their own course, to traverse the uncharted expanse of their own egocentric universe.  We twist and turn, adopting one creed only to shed it like a worn skin, embracing another in its place.  Through this journey, we seek to define ourselves, to find the light that pierces the darkness and guides us toward the warmth of the unknown.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, huddled on the porch as the rain lashed down, drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above.  He sat lost in thought, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon, his gaze a mix of searching and remembrance.  His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his body like a shroud.  His hair, once a robust thatch, had thinned, its sparse strands a stark reminder of his frailty.  I felt a creeping sense of dread, a sense of loss that I could not voice, for in speaking it aloud, I feared I would only make it more real.\n\nI leaned in, embracing him, trying to draw comfort from his presence.  We sat together, lost in the rhythm of the rain, our eyes fixed on some point beyond the veil of the present.  It was as if we were both suspended, trapped in the amber of that moment, unable to move, unable to break free from the gravitational pull of our grief.\n\nMy father passed into the great beyond just a few days shy of my twenty-second birthday, in the cold dark of December.  The chemo and radiation, those pitiless instruments of medicine, had prolonged his suffering, but I could not discern the value in this prolongation.  In the still of the night, I questioned the existence of a benevolent deity.  If such a being existed, I wondered, had it abandoned me long ago?\n\nI chose not to bear witness to his final moments.  I could not stomach the spectacle of life ebbing from his body, of the essence that made me taking its final breath.  I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died.  And so, I turned away, curling into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news that would forever change the course of my life.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.  No one called to offer solace, no one reached out to offer a comforting word.  In that desolate landscape of loss, I was left to navigate the ruins of my grief, alone and adrift in a world that seemed to have moved on without me.",
            "Time shattered, the Gothic novel like a mirror reflecting the ruin of all that is old and new. For in its depths, the oxymoron of the name \"Gothic\" speaks to the very heart of the genre's essence: an anachronism born of a bygone era, yet forged anew in the crucible of modernity. As Ian Watt so astutely observed, the Gothic novel is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" - a confluence of the antiquated and the modern, where the shadows of the past converge with the clarion call of the present.\n\nIn the dimly lit recesses of literary history, the Gothic novel emerged as a bastard child of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a work that wove together the threads of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition to create a new tapestry of expression. Like a ghost haunting the halls of time, the Gothic genre has lingered, its presence felt yet forever displaced from the moment of its conception. And it was Walpole, a master weaver of contradictions, who first forged the links between the old and the new, the theatrical and the natural, to give birth to the Gothic novel.\n\nThe word \"gothic\" itself had long been a cipher, a term that conjured up images of an archaic, unsophisticated people, a byword for all that was considered inferior in the face of modern progress. Yet, it was precisely this paradox that fueled the Gothic novel's enduring power, its ability to blend the excesses of the past with the innovations of the present. The marriage of the Gothic and the novelistic form, with its emphasis on the inner lives of its characters, allowed the genre to transcend time and space, speaking to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most potent legacies of the Gothic tradition is the ideal of chivalry, that quintessential medieval code of honor and virtue. In the hands of Walpole and his ilk, chivalry became a fetish, a symbol of a lost golden age of heroism and nobility. Through the lens of chivalry, the Gothic novelists peered into the abyss of their own time, critiquing the shortcomings of their contemporaries and yearning for a bygone era of glory. Frederic, the hero of The Castle of Otranto, embodies this ideal, a prince of unimpeachable honor, forged in the crucible of suffering and tragedy. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a gallant and courteous knight.\n\nYet, as with all things Gothic, excess lurks just beneath the surface. Frederic's chivalry is an exaggeration, a caricature of the very ideals he represents. And it is this excess, this over-the-top romanticism, that gives the Gothic novel its peculiar, unsettling power. Like a dark mirror reflecting the pathologies of its creators, the Gothic novel holds up a vision of a distorted world, one where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the very fabric of society seems to unravel.\n\nIn the end, the Gothic novel remains a forever-displaced entity, a creature of the liminal spaces between past and present, old and new. Its power lies in its ability to evoke the terrible sublime, to conjure up a world of darkness and wonder, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present. And it is this very oxymoron, this blend of the old and the new, that continues to haunt us still, a ghostly presence that haunts the halls of literature, a reminder of the enduring power of the Gothic novel to shape our perceptions of the world, and ourselves.",
            "In the bleak landscape of commerce, a labyrinthine network of processes unwinds, a serpentine path of goods from the customer's desire to the raw materials stage, through supply, production, and distribution to the final destination. This was the concept born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a sage of industry. He laid bare the intricate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satiate the customer's needs with haste and efficiency. Six key pillars undergird this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nProduction, the foundation upon which the entire edifice rests, is the first step in this odyssey. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are distilled into a singular purpose. Managers must divine the desires of the customer, a task accomplished by gazing into the market's abyss, where the customer's demands are writ large. Once the market's secrets are unearthed, managers can determine what products should be forged, how many, and where they should be crafted, all in service to the customer's satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to schedule the production, a choreographed ballet of workloads and equipment maintenance, each detail vital to the grand symphony. A failure to orchestrate these elements would be akin to a cacophony, costing the company dearly in the long run. I recall my own tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, where every action, from the uniform to the reception of shipments, was choreographed with precision. A well-rehearsed plan allowed these behemoths to operate with purpose, their employees a finely tuned machine.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the strategic decisions that define a company's core competencies and outsourcing partnerships. A product's creation may involve multiple divisions, each with its own specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. The manager must discern which division is best suited for each task, or choose to outsource to other companies, leveraging the velocity of partnership to provide quality, flexibility, and reduced costs.",
            "A faded poster clung to the wall, its message scrawled in red ink like a rip in the fabric of time. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", it read, a blasphemy that hung like a specter in the stillness. Ellen Page, her face a mask of quiet desperation, stood alone on the corner, her cardboard sign a talisman against the void. Below her, the city stretched out like a barren landscape, its streets a testament to the ravages of time.\n\nBeneath the canvas of the poster, the weight of history bore down, a crushing force that had brought about the ruin of countless lives. Burma, a land of ancient rivers and forgotten cultures, had succumbed to the darkness, its people subjugated by the iron fist of the military junta. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting glimmer of hope, had been extinguished by the cold calculation of those who ruled. Monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, had been hunted and killed, their bloodstained robes a symbol of the violence that had been unleashed.\n\nThe examples of such brutality were legion, scattered across the annals of history like the carcasses of beasts slaughtered by the hand of man. The Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a deity, a being of divine right, accountable to no one. And in the United States, the leader of the free world, a man named George W. Bush, held court with the zealots of the Republic Party, their collective ignorance a palpable force that threatened to consume them all.\n\nThe memories of Tiananmen Square, of Rwanda's killing fields, of Hitler's Third Reich, lingered like a miasma, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within the hearts of men. The faces of the dead, their eyes frozen in perpetual horror, haunted the dreams of those who had survived. And yet, even in the face of such unimaginable evil, there was a glimmer of hope, a spark of resistance that refused to be extinguished.\n\nAs Ellen Page stood on the corner, her cardboard sign a beacon of defiance, the city around her seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening into abysses that yawned like the mouths of graves. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, secrets of a world gone mad, where the strong preyed upon the weak, and the powerful ruled with impunity. And yet, even in the midst of such chaos, there was a sense of calm, a stillness that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth. It was a sense that had been passed down through the ages, a knowledge that had been etched into the souls of those who had come before, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always a glimmer of light, a spark that refused to be extinguished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of jazz history, a lone figure stands as a testament to the indomitable will to create. Duke Ellington, a maestro of melody, left an indelible mark on the genre, his legacy forged in the crucible of time and tempered by his unwavering dedication to his craft. The piano, an instrument of subtle elegance, often yielded to Ellington's guiding hand, as he wove a tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. A composer of unyielding vision, Ellington crafted an architecture that allowed his soloists to improvise freely, while his tightly orchestrated pieces coalesced into a cohesive whole, a symphony of disparate parts.\n\nEllington's mastery of the individual player's timbre and their place within the ensemble enabled him to conjure pieces that transcended the boundaries of innovation, their brilliance a testament to his unwavering artistry. His approach was not unlike a conductor guiding his orchestra through a tempestuous sea, ever-vigilant and attuned to the subtlest nuances of tone and texture.\n\nIn the early days of his career, Ellington's voice became a jazz instrument, a versatile tool that added depth and color to his compositions. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues piece, exemplifies this aspect of his artistry. This haunting melody, with its call-and-response structure, reveals Ellington's ability to coax the very essence from his soloists, Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scat singing entwining in a rich and complementary tapestry. The piece unfolds like a slow-moving river, its six choruses unfolding like leaves on a branch, each one a testament to Ellington's skill in teasing out the unique qualities of his players.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a theme that resonates throughout his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines his orchestral acumen with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between Miley and Cox is a masterclass in texture and timbre, a delicate balance of voice and instrument that yields a sound both rich and cohesive. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, as Ellington deftly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, the sound a testament to the maestro's ability to coax the very essence from his players.\n\nIn the annals of jazz, Ellington's name stands as a beacon, a shining testament to the transformative power of art. His music, a reflection of his indomitable spirit, continues to captivate and inspire, a paean to the human experience in all its complexity and beauty.",
            "A hollowness gnawed within her, an ache that defied fulfillment. It had begun some four years prior, its roots taking hold like a slow-moving stain. Now, at seventeen, it remained as elusive as the first wisps of dawn breaking over the horizon. She had grown accustomed to this hollow, this gnawing sense of incompleteness, but it refused to be sated. It was as if her very essence was a vast, uncharted expanse, a desolate landscape she struggled to navigate.\n\nHer days were a series of drifting tides, each one ebbing away without a sense of purpose. She wandered, an aimless traveler, searching for a north star to guide her. Her interactions with others were fleeting, inconsequential, like the whispers of a summer breeze. She had tried to attribute her malaise to the turmoil of adolescence, but even as she entered the tempestuous waters of her late teens, the void remained, a constant, gnawing presence.\n\nAt home, a sense of tranquility reigned, a fragile balance of calm and love. Her parents were a study in serenity, their disagreements few and far between. But she was a force of nature, a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, and her parents' gentle natures often found themselves buffeted by her unbridled enthusiasm. Today, however, was a different tale. The peace was shattered, the calm shattered, by the anguish in her mother's voice.\n\nShe heard the scream, a cry that pierced the air like a shard of glass. She ran, her heart racing, her mind aflame with fear. The kitchen, once a sanctuary of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos. Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, her voice a desperate plea for help. She fell to her side, her hand reaching out to touch her mother's, to offer what comfort she could in this moment of despair.\n\n\"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with urgency.\n\nHer mother's response was a garbled mixture of pain and fear, a plea for her daughter to take her to the hospital. And so she did, carrying her mother to the car, her heart heavy with worry. The drive was a blur of fear and uncertainty, the only sound the soft hum of the engine and her mother's labored breathing.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a fortress of steel and stone, a place where the sick and the injured came to find solace. But she was not thinking of solace now. She was thinking of her mother, of the pain and the fear etched on her face. She helped her mother from the car, carried her into the hospital, and called out for help.\n\nThe doctors and nurses swarmed around, their faces a blur of concern and compassion. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter to sit in the waiting room, her heart heavy with worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a simple accident, but one that had unleashed a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty.\n\nShe sat, lost in thought, her mind a jumble of emotions. Her mother, once strong and capable, now lay in the hospital, her body broken and battered. She thought of all the times they had laughed together, the memories they had created, and the memories yet to be made. And in this moment, she knew that she would do anything to ensure her mother's well-being, to be there for her, to hold her hand and to comfort her.\n\nTime lost all meaning as she sat there, her heart heavy with worry. The only sound was the soft hum of the hospital, a reminder of the fragility of life, of the beauty and the pain that lay just beneath the surface. And in this moment, she knew that she would face whatever came next, armed with the love and the strength that had always defined her relationship with her mother.",
            "In a desolate expanse, where the ravages of time and neglect had left their indelible mark, a distinct pattern emerged. A spectacle of life, forged in the crucible of diet and habit, presented itself in a stark and unforgiving landscape. The \"Mediterranean Diet,\" a siren's call to the senses, beckoned those who sought to defy the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet, a variant of the Mediterranean's sacred lore, was characterized by an austere worship of plant-based offerings: fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, tempered by the austere beauty of monounsaturated fats, and the gentle caress of moderate alcohol intake.\n\nA prior generation of scholars had documented the inverse relationship between adherence to this diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention had shown the Mediterranean Diet to be a potent balm, soothing the tormented souls of the obese, and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the siren's call had been muted, as prior studies had not focused on the dark and foreboding shores of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nIt was in this void that a new inquiry emerged, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who had been part of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six epochs, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, a subtle and intricate dance of nutrient intake, as reflected in self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\" These women, like leaves on a windswept tree, continued their participation, a testament to their resolve, as over 95% persisted throughout the 20-year journey.\n\nThese questionnaires, like ancient artifacts, were subjected to validation studies, their worthiness to tell the tale of nutrient intake, a matter of reverence and awe. The reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, were confirmed by the hallowed records of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were relegated to the realm of the probable, a dark and foreboding category, comprising about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nLike the ebb and flow of the tides, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each food frequency questionnaire, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed, a beacon of hope in a world of despair, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious whims of random variation, and to better capture the long-term dietary tapestry, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated, a masterful weaving of scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences, a necessary act of purification, to ensure that the results were untainted by the whispers of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe instrument of analysis, Cox proportional-hazard modeling, was employed to assess the relationship between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, a delicate dance of probabilities, a separate modeling for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nIn this vast and unforgiving expanse, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was found to be associated with a lower risk of incident chronic heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of chronic heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet were found to be at a lower risk for both chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The darkness crept in with the crash of '07, a cold wind that howled through the streets of Wall Street, a calamity that shook the very foundations of a nation. The once-mighty edifice of American prosperity crumbled, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and vanquished hope. The ghosts of unemployment and despair roamed the land, their whispers echoing through the hollowed halls of a desolate economy. And yet, even now, we must confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity befall us, and how might we avoid it in the future?\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in the fertile soil of hubris and shortsightedness, when the guardians of power, blinded by ambition and avarice, pushed the banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans, a reckless gamble that would ultimately prove their undoing. The vaunted financial infrastructure, once a bastion of stability, proved woefully inadequate to the task, a crumbling dam that could not contain the deluge that was to come. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the mortgage market, were forced to play the dealer, packaging and repackaging these toxic assets, their influence spreading like a stain across the financial landscape.\n\nThe roots of this disaster stretched back to the Clinton era, when the President's lust for power and popularity led him to relax the lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of a crisis that would come to fruition seven years later. The New York Times prophetically reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The warning signs were there, yet they were ignored, and the consequences were dire.\n\nThe complexity of the mortgage market, with its adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, was a house of cards, waiting to be toppled by the slightest breeze. And topple it did, sending the economy into a tailspin from which it has yet to recover. The top five U.S. investment banks alone held a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The great crash of '07 left in its wake a trail of destruction, as Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with a $5 trillion mortgage debt, were brought under government control in September 2008.\n\nIn the aftermath of this devastation, we are left to ponder the question: how might we avoid this calamity in the future? Can we learn from the mistakes of the past and forge a new path, one that eschews the hubris and shortsightedness that led to this disaster? Or will we repeat the mistakes of our forebears, doomed to relive the same cycle of boom and bust? The darkness still looms, a specter that haunts our collective future, a reminder that the lessons of the past must be learned, lest we succumb to the same abyss that consumed us in the crash of '07.",
            "Exposition, that siren song that lures writers into the depths of tedium.  A place where the words seem to stretch out before them like a barren plain, devoid of the intricate dance of action and emotion that draws the reader in.  It is the moment when the writer's prose falters, when the story stalls, and the reader's eyes begin to glaze over in a desperate bid for escape.\n\nAnd yet, like a bad habit, it is a temptation that many of us succumb to.  The urge to tell, to explain, to inform, to dump the reader's head with a cacophony of unnecessary details.  But exposition is the enemy of the writer, a cruel mistress that promises to save us from the drudgery of crafting a compelling narrative, but delivers only a dull, leaden weight that threatens to drag our story down into the depths of obscurity.\n\nTake, for example, the oft-repeated maxim \"Show, don't tell.\"  It is a wise and ancient adage, one that has been drummed into our heads since our earliest days as writers.  But it is not a hard and fast rule, a simple checkbox to be ticked off on our list of writing dos and don'ts.  Rather, it is a nuanced art, a delicate balance between the need to inform and the need to engage.\n\nConsider the heroine of our tale, a woman whose husband meets a tragic end at the hands of a villain.  We are told of their love, their marriage, his death, but do we truly feel the weight of their bond, the depth of their sorrow?  Or do we feel only the faintest whisper of their existence, a ghostly presence that haunts the edges of our perception?  It is the writer's job to bring them to life, to breathe the spark of life into their story, to make us feel the sting of his loss.\n\nAnd how do we do this?  By showing, not telling.  By weaving the threads of their story into the fabric of the narrative, by making his love and her grief palpable, tangible, real.  We do not simply tell the reader of their experiences, we show them in all their messy, complicated glory.  We give them the gift of insight, of understanding, of connection.\n\nBut how do we avoid the pitfalls of exposition, that seductive and treacherous path that waits to snare the unwary writer?  We do it by crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and efficient.  We do it by cutting away the fat, the unnecessary words, the excess verbiage that clutters the page.  We do it by trusting our readers to infer, to fill in the gaps, to create their own narrative alongside us.\n\nAnd when we fail, when we succumb to the temptation of exposition, when we fill page after page with tedious, unnecessary detail, what's left?  A story that is as flat as a pancake, as dull as a butter knife.  A story that is doomed to fail, to wither and die on the vine of reader apathy.\n\nSo let us beware, dear writers, the siren song of exposition.  Let us shun its treacherous shores, and chart a course for the rich, fertile waters of storytelling.  Let us show, not tell, and let our readers be our guides, our confidants, our friends in the journey of creation.",
            "The static glow of the television cast a faint sheen upon the walls of the hovel. He watched as the news anchors shaped the world anew, their words a litany of violence and despair. In the dimly lit room, the flickering screen cast an eerie pallor, a haunted glow that seemed to emanate from the very core of the machine. He watched as the stories unfolded, each one a thread in the tapestry of a world gone mad.\n\nA man in Ashley, Ohio, had committed an atrocity, stabbing his wife with unyielding ferocity. The camera panned to a mugshot, the face a twisted visage of cruelty, the eyes seeming to leer from the frame. The broadcast flickered on, a meager two minutes devoted to the tale of Shad Hostettler, a name that would soon be lost in the void.\n\nThe next story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed a fleeting concern, a whisper of tragedy in a world that had grown numb. A young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, the police scrambling to unravel the threads of the crime. But the tale was quickly forgotten, lost amidst the din of other stories, other tragedies.\n\nA gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a reward offered for the capture of the perpetrator. The details were stark, the image of the bullet-riddled aircraft a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner of the world.\n\nAnd then, a fleeting mention of the rain and thunderstorms to come. A tease, a tantalizing promise of something greater to come, a brief respite from the darkness that had consumed the world.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, a hoodie-clad figure, had struck, leaving behind a trail of fear and destruction. The camera lingered on the face of the perpetrator, emboldening the emphasis on his skin tone, his height, his weight. A petty crime, and yet, it seemed, a crime worthy of special attention.\n\nAnd then, a tale of a convicted drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a man who had brought ruin and despair to the lives of countless others. His sentence, twenty-five years, a paltry number, or so it seemed, when reduced to mere months: 300. A curious choice of words, a way of softening the blow, or perhaps, a way of emphasizing the gravity of the crime.\n\nThe news anchors spoke of him as a Hispanic man, a label that seemed almost an afterthought, a gratuitous detail, a way of setting the tone for the story to come. And as he watched, the images faded, the stories blurring together like watercolors on wet paper. The world outside the television screen seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening, the silence thickening. He turned off the set, plunging the room into an oppressive stillness, the only sound the distant hum of the world outside, a world that seemed to be slowly unraveling.",
            "A bond of blood, an unyielding tie that binds brothers together - a knot of emotions tangled like the roots of an ancient tree. Pride, love, and jealousy, like serpents entwined, writhing in the dark recesses of the heart. And cruelty, a poison that seeps into the marrow, corroding the very soul. It is in times of extremity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, and the depths of their connection are laid bare. The weight of these emotions, like a burden that cannot be shaken, exacts a terrible cost. To behold one's brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss within - a chasm of darkness and light, of good and evil. It is in the aftermath of their actions, in the echoes of their deeds, that the true character of a brother is revealed.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a perilous journey, their bond forged in the crucible of adversity. The verdant world around them, once a tapestry of hope and promise, is reduced to a barren and unforgiving expanse. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The narrator's voice, a mournful whisper that echoes through the narrative, bears witness to the turmoil that rages within the protagonist's heart.\n\nThe protagonist's actions, a tangled web of pride and resentment, are a testament to the complexities of their bond. From the outset, he had envisioned a brother who would be his equal, his partner in adventure and exploration. But the reality of Doodle's fragile existence, a fragile flame flickering in the darkness, shatters his illusions. The protagonist's rage and frustration boil over, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to consume him whole. And yet, it is in the depths of this turmoil that a glimmer of love and compassion flickers, a beacon of hope that illuminates the darkness.\n\nThe protagonist's heart, a battleground of conflicting emotions, is a battleground where love and cruelty, hope and despair, engage in an eternal struggle. His feelings for Doodle, a labyrinth of contradictions, are a microcosm of the human condition - a complex and multifaceted tapestry woven from the threads of love, pride, and jealousy. In the end, it is not the physical world that is defeated, but the protagonist's own demons, their bond with Doodle a testament to the redemptive power of love and compassion.",
            "The brain, a labyrinthine repository of information, a maelstrom of electrochemical signals, a system that defies comprehension. As the world outside has crumbled, so too has our understanding of its intricate workings. We once likened it to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a contraption of ones and zeros, a mockery of its true nature. Yet, as we delve deeper into its mysteries, we find that these metaphors falter, leading us down a path of misconception.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the senses, those windows to the world that translate the raw data of light, sound, touch, and heat into a language the brain can understand. The signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, dance through the neural networks, transformed by the brain's algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. We see a box on a white background, and the brain, like a patient craftsman, assembles the disparate threads of color, orientation, and border into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, like a skilled navigator, charts the course, speeding the recognition of the box, guiding our perception. Yet, even as we acknowledge its presence, our attention filter, a gatekeeper of sorts, decides what is worthy of notice, filtering out the irrelevant, the superfluous.\n\nAs information is processed, it is modulated by attention, a selective gaze that determines its significance and the cognitive processes it shall be made available to. We see every blade of grass, but our attention, a razor-sharp blade, cuts through the noise, allowing us to focus on the essential. And when our name is spoken in a cacophony of sound, our attention, like a homing pigeon, homing in on the signal, makes it audible above the din.\n\nMemory, a labyrinthine repository of knowledge, is forged through encoding, a process as mysterious as the whisper of the wind. There are types of encoding, each specific to the sensory stimuli that birthed it. Verbal input, like a hieroglyphic script, can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on the nature of the input. And once stored, information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical signals that course through the neural networks, a flickering candle in the darkness.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a puzzle, a tapestry woven from disparate threads. Some propose that it is a semantic network, a web of nodes representing concepts, linked by their relatedness. In this vast, labyrinthine structure, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But the brain, a mystery, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, remains an enigma, its secrets locked within its labyrinthine recesses, waiting to be unlocked by the curious and the brave.",
            "The specter of technology and the monolithic structure of capitalism looms over the horizon, a dystopian landscape foretold by Aldous Huxley's prescient novel, Brave New World. A world where the ethos of community supplants individuality, where the masses are conditioned to chase ephemeral happiness above all else. The denizens of this nightmarish realm are pawns in a grand game, their existence predetermined by the World Controller's all-encompassing ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theism, we glimpse Huxley's disquieting suspicions regarding the burgeoning systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxist thought – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the emerging economy.\n\nIn this Brave New World, capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark regarding the true nature of their relationships with other classes, ensnared in a web of ideological control that prioritizes their own self-interest above all else. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by hypnopædia, instills an insatiable drive to consume, spend, and indulge, a siren's call manipulated by the World Controller. The lower classes, relegated to the Delta, Gamma, and other such designations, are mere puppets, their wills subjugated to the whims of the dominant ideology. They are complicit in their own oppression, buying into a system that perpetuates the status quo.\n\nHegemony, the idea that one group holds sway over others, is starkly evident in this dystopian society. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, do little to challenge the system, content to accept their station in life. The interactions between individuals, or rather the lack thereof, serve as a potent indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. Relationships are superficial, lacking depth or substance, as exemplified by the shallow comments of the male characters regarding women's physical appearance and the women's unapologetic descriptions of their experiences. The societal classes' complacency with their position in the hierarchy is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to obey and conform, convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.\n\nIn this bleak world, love and genuine emotions are anathema, replaced by a stultifying superficiality. The characters' interactions are a far cry from the rich tapestry of human experience, reduced to shallow transactions and fleeting encounters. Huxley's Brave New World serves as a warning, a dire prophecy of a future where technology and capitalism converge to deprive humanity of its free will and emotional expression. The novel's bleak vision serves as a clarion call, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the dehumanizing effects of a system that values consumption over connection.",
            "Four years spent within these walls, a fractured landscape of stone and steel. It is a place where feet move with purpose, where paths converge and diverge like the arteries of a great, sprawling beast. And yet, in this labyrinthine sprawl, the journey from one point to another can be a Sisyphean task. I have known this struggle, traversing the distance from East Halls to Willard building, a trek that once took up to a quarter hour on foot, and longer still in the rain. The elements, a capricious mistress, can turn even the shortest path into an odyssey.\n\nI recall a conversation with an alumnus, a man not much older than myself, who spoke of the campus as it once was – a place where the East Halls stood apart, shrouded in a sea of vacant land. But time, that great clarifier, has seen the transformation of this desolate expanse into a tapestry of sports fields, modern edifices, and apartments. As the campus continues to expand, so too does the difficulty of navigating its twists and turns. In this regard, the bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a mode of transportation both efficient and elegant. Yet, it is not merely a matter of possessing a bike; it is a question of cultivating a culture that values the pedestrian and the cyclist.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after a long hiatus, and his words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The bicycle is not merely a mode of transportation; it is a way of life, a means of connecting with the world around us. And, like many of my peers, I have come to realize that it is the key to unlocking the secrets of this campus. From my home off-campus, a place not dissimilar from some of the dorms, I could walk to Thomas building in a quarter hour or more. But with a bike, the journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a fraction of the time I would spend on foot. The road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is a challenge, a serpentine path that winds through the heart of the campus. It is a route that requires patience, a path that tests one's resolve.\n\nAnd yet, I would not trade it for the world. For in the rhythm of the pedals, I find a sense of freedom, a sense of purpose. The bicycle is not merely a tool; it is an extension of the self, a means of navigating the complexities of this campus. It is a reminder that even in the most seemingly insurmountable challenges, there is always a way forward, always a path that winds its way through the darkness. And so, I will continue to ride, to pedal through the twists and turns of this campus, ever seeking the beauty that lies just beyond the horizon."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate expanse of human suffering, I am drawn to the pursuit of an education in social work, a vocation that beckons me to navigate the labyrinthine paths of the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounded and the forsaken reside. It is here, amidst the bleak landscapes of abuse and neglect, that I aspire to offer solace and support to the innocent, to be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. \n\nIn this dismal tapestry, I bring with me the threads of service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships and the sharpening of my own professional edge. These values, forged in the crucible of my own experiences and convictions, are not mere platitudes, but a testament to the fire that burns within me, a flame that illuminates the darkness and guides me towards a life of purpose.\n\nMy journey towards this vocation has been a winding one, beset on all sides by the ghosts of uncertainty and doubt. For years, I wandered, lost in the wilderness of my own aspirations, uncertain of the path that lay before me. It was not until I chanced upon a friend, her home a sanctuary from the tempests of the world, that I encountered a young soul, torn asunder by the tumult of his own family's dysfunction. And it was in that moment, as I beheld the anguish etched upon his face, that I knew my calling, my raison d'être.\n\nThe events that transpired subsequent to that fateful encounter only served to solidify my resolve. The parents, a pair of towering phantoms, their faces shrouded in deceit and malice, seemed to recoil from the very notion of accountability, their words a tangled web of excuses and half-truths. And it was then, in the depths of that darkness, that I knew I had to act, to intervene, to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nIn the years that followed, I continued to navigate the treacherous waters of social injustice, a rebel, a dissident, a force to be reckoned with. I defied the conventions of a society that values conformity above all else, that seeks to stifle individuality and uniqueness. I wore my heart on my sleeve, my colors bold and unapologetic, my voice a clarion call to action.\n\nAnd it is this same spirit, this same fire that burns within me, that drives me to pursue a career in social work, to challenge the status quo, to be a champion of social justice. For I know that the individual, that fragile, flickering flame of humanity, is the very essence of our existence, and that it is our duty, our sacred obligation, to protect, to nurture, and to preserve it.",
            "The desolate landscape of slumber stretched before us, a vast and unfilled expanse of darkness. It was a terrain scarred by the scourge of insomnia, a disorder that left its victims stranded, lost and unmoored in a world of perpetual wakefulness. The biological model, with its cold and unforgiving logic, reduced this affliction to its constituent parts: genes and heritable factors, the physiologic underpinnings of a slumber that refused to come. Like a barren and unforgiving land, the hypothalamus, that most ancient and mysterious of organs, held sway over the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. And within its depths, the neurons, like sentinels of the night, guarded the gates of Morpheus, their delicate balance tipping the scales between repose and unrest.\n\nThe study of mice, those tiny, inscrutable creatures, had revealed a hidden order, a phenomenology of slumber and wakefulness that was both wondrous and terrible. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like unseen hands, reached out to grasp the threads of sleep, to weave a tapestry of rest and rejuvenation. And when these receptors faltered, or failed, the very fabric of existence was rent asunder, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered lives and broken dreams.\n\nThe sociocultural models, with their plaintive cry of environmental determinism, beckoned us to consider the world beyond the narrow confines of the individual. Like a vast and mysterious sea, the collective experience of humanity stretched out before us, a maelstrom of influences that shaped and molded the human spirit. The inherited phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, whispered secrets to us of a past long forgotten, a past that shaped the contours of our present. And the sociocultural models, like wise and ancient sages, counseled us to heed this whisper, to listen to the hidden rhythms of the human heart.\n\nIn the dark and dusty recesses of the human experience, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that twists and turns like a serpent through the underbrush of our collective unconscious. It is a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within. Primary insomnia, a difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, a waking nightmare that haunted the somnambulant hours; primary hypersomnia, a waking world that threatened to consume us whole; narcolepsy, a catatonia of the will, a surrender to the void; breathing-related sleep disorder, a gasping for air in a world that seemed to suffocate us; circadian rhythm sleep disorder, a disordered clockwork, a world gone mad.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this chaos, there is a glimmer of hope, a light that flickers like a candle in the wind. For in the study of these disorders, we find a glimmer of understanding, a hint of a language that speaks to the very heart of our humanity. The GABAB receptor, that mysterious and elusive entity, held the key to this understanding, a key that unlocked the doors of perception, revealing the hidden workings of the human brain.\n\nBut what of the sociocultural implications of this study? What of the world beyond the laboratory, the world that lay shrouded in the mists of uncertainty? The answer, like a ghostly presence, haunted the edges of our perception, a presence that whispered secrets to us of a world in which the biological and sociocultural models intertwined like the threads of a tapestry. A world in which the phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, shaped the contours of our present, a world in which the very fabric of existence was woven from the threads of our collective experience.\n\nAnd so, we return to the starting point, to the desolate landscape of slumber, to the biological and sociocultural models that stretch out before us like a vast and unforgiving expanse. It is a terrain that is both familiar and strange, a world that is at once both our own and yet utterly alien. And in this world, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within. But it is also a world of hope, a world in which the biological and sociocultural models intertwine like the threads of a tapestry, a world in which the very fabric of existence is woven from the threads of our collective experience.",
            "The desolate vastness of the human experience stretches out before us like an uncharted terrain. In this unforgiving landscape, some souls stumble upon the jagged edges of a hidden disorder: Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a condition where the very fabric of perception is rent asunder, leaving the sufferer lost in a world of discordant sounds and muffled whispers. Like a traveler in a barren wilderness, one must navigate the uncharted territories of diagnosis and understanding.\n\nThe earliest whispers of CAPD's presence can be heard in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers first began to study the mysterious affliction. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari were among the first to chart this unexplored terrain, developing tests to unravel the tangled threads of the disorder. Like a pair of pioneers, they ventured into the unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the human mind.\n\nBut CAPD's manifestations are as varied as the desert sands that shift and swirl in the wind. Some are unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, like a traveler lost in a maze of echoing canyons. Others struggle to distinguish between two or more competing sounds, their ears muffled by the din of the world. Still, others are crippled by the inability to recognize patterns, like a poet struggling to find the rhythm in a sea of discordant notes.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and uncharted territory. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the treacherous landscape of auditory function, using a variety of measures to evaluate the patient's skills. Like a mapmaker charting the unknown, they rely on systematic observation and performance tests to guide them through the unexplored regions of the mind.\n\nThere is no single tool or test that holds the key to unlocking the secrets of CAPD, no compass to guide the traveler through the wilderness of the human experience. Instead, a patchwork of assessments and evaluations must be woven together to form a fragile tapestry of understanding. The patient is presented with a series of auditory stimuli, a cacophony of sounds that must be unraveled like a knot in a rope.\n\nAnd yet, even in the face of this uncertainty, there are those who seek to help. Teachers in mainstreamed classrooms, like beacons in the darkness, can offer a lifeline to students struggling to navigate the turbulent waters of CAPD. With patience, understanding, and a willingness to learn, they can help their students find a path through the wilderness of sound, a path that may be as fragile as a reed in the wind, but one that holds the promise of a brighter future.\n\nAs we venture into the unknown, we must remember that CAPD is a disorder of perception, a condition that affects not just the ears, but the very fabric of our understanding. Like a traveler in a strange land, we must be willing to listen, to seek out the whispers of understanding, and to follow the faint trail of clues that lead us deeper into the mystery of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the tools or the tests that hold the key to understanding CAPD, but the willingness to listen, to seek out the hidden patterns, and to chart a course through the uncharted territories of the human mind.",
            "In the masquerade of Twelfth Night, the duplicity of disguise seems a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows for the perpetuation of deception, a shield to deflect the cruel hand of fate. Yet, it is a fragile bulwark, one that must eventually be shed lest the soul be lost to the void. The problem lies not in the shedding of the disguise, but in the cost of stripping away the veil: the risk of alienation, of severing ties with those who have come to know us in our falsehood.\n\nThe subject of deception, particularly in the realm of gender role reversal, raises complications of its own. It is a tangled web, with each strand a knotted consideration. Why do we don the guise of another? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as in Viola's case, where the misty veil of the unknown demands a transformation to safeguard her very existence? As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in doing so, she cuts herself off from the support of her own sex, a severance that would test the mettle of even the strongest heart.\n\nIn the cold light of Illyria, Viola's ruse is so convincing that it breeds confusion, her identity subsumed by the newcomer Sebastian. Olivia's affections are torn asunder, like a thread pulled from its weft, as she falls prey to the mistaken ardor, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, the nascent feelings between Viola and Orsino remain unspoken, a subterranean current that threatens to burst forth in the unlikeliest of moments, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nYet, it is in the guise of Cesario that Twelfth Night reveals the latent desires of its characters, a subtext that whispers of unrequited love and hidden longings. Olivia's switch of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her gentle regard for Viola as sibling, seems a jest, a send-up of the societal norms of the time. It is a jest that belies a deeper truth: that our desires are as multifaceted as the masks we wear.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a question: what lies beyond the veil of deception, the hidden self that we dare not confront? Is it a truth that sets us free, or a prison from which we cannot escape? The play holds its answer close, a secret known only to the playwright's pen.",
            "The shadows of colonialism lay heavy over the vast expanse of German rule, its brutal visage most starkly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, this bleak portrayal cannot encompass the full scope of a colonial empire as multifaceted as the German. Educational provision, like the empire itself, was a tapestry woven from diverse threads, each one distinct in its fabric and hue. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational efforts were lauded by contemporary scholars.\n\nMeanwhile, in South West Africa, a stark contrast unfolded. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of the native population, the task of educating the Ovaherero and Nama was left largely to the mission societies, their efforts woefully underpinned by the colonial authorities. The government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and bolstering the missionary schools with patronage and regulation. These policies bore lasting consequences for South West Africa, even after the dissolution of German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where the African population had made significant strides in literacy and education, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The confluence of various social, political, and economic factors gave rise to this divergent experience, and this paper seeks to shed light on these underlying forces, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nA vast literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, most of which is rooted in German and dates back to the era of German colonial rule. These early works focused primarily on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the striking differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A seminal work in this regard is Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of the two colonies, underscoring the factors that contributed to their divergence. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nGeography played a crucial role in shaping the German colonial experience, particularly in South West Africa. The colony's moderately temperate climate belied its arid desert expanses, which covered a substantial portion of the territory. The European population of South West Africa, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, was a direct reflection of the region's relatively hospitable conditions. In stark contrast, East Africa, with its next largest settler population, harbored only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The darkness that defined it, like a shadow cast across the land, stretched out before them like a canvas of endless possibility. Over the past century, the classifications of popular music had grown like a twisted, gnarled tree, its branches heavy with the weight of countless sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. And at its dark, twisted heart lay the behemoth of Heavy Metal, a creature that had burst forth like a screaming, fiery apparition from the very depths of the earth.\n\nIt was a music of excess, of more – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. A sound that shook the very foundations of the soul, like the rumbling of thunder on a summer's day. And yet, it was also a music of precision, of chops, of musicians who wielded their instruments like masters of a dark, ancient art. The influence of psychedelic drugs, like a whispered incantation, had seeped into the marrow of the genre, imbuing it with a sense of the surreal and the otherworldly.\n\nThe darkness that lurked within was a siren's call, drawing in the lost and the disillusioned like moths to a flame. It was a music of the damned, of the outcasts and the outlaws, of those who dwelled in the shadows and danced with the darkness. And yet, it was also a music of the sublime, of the Romantic Era's dark, visceral qualities, which had been coaxed forth like a ghost from the very depths of the human experience.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, like a bleak, neon-lit neon sign, screamed out into the void, a testament to the darkness that lay at the heart of the movement. It was a cry of rebellion, a challenge to the status quo, a declaration that the Beatles, like a phoenix from the ashes, could rise up and be as heavy, as dark, as the Rolling Stones. And so, the White Album was born, a twisted, mutated creature, a marriage of the dark and the light, of the beautiful and the grotesque.\n\nAs the years went by, the genre continued to twist and turn, like a living, breathing thing, spawning sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like a hydra's head, each one more monstrous, more beautiful, more alive than the last. And at its heart, like a dark, pulsing core, lay the Heavy Metal movement, a behemoth that would not be silenced, would not be tamed, a music that would rage on, like a wildfire, until the very end of time itself.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists unleashed their dreamlike visions upon the world, Henri Rousseau was quietly toiling away, his brushstrokes imbuing his canvases with the essence of his own nocturnal wanderings. The Dream, a painting from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle - a struggle to reconcile the desire for recognition with the need for creative freedom. Like a traveler who ventures into the unknown, Rousseau found himself beset by the same fear of being lost and the same yearning for guidance.\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's biography, a narrative woven from the threads of his own making. Born in the town of Laval in northwest France on a spring morning in 1844, Rousseau was the scion of a family that enjoyed a comfortable, if not extravagant, existence. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, he was denied the formal education that would have provided a clear path forward. Instead, he toiled in obscurity, working as a gabelou for the municipal toll service until the age of forty, his existence a shadowy presence among the bustle of everyday life.\n\nIt was only after the cruel hand of fate dealt him a devastating blow - the loss of his wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children - that Rousseau turned to painting as a means of escape, a way to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Unencumbered by the conventions of his time, he poured his heart and soul into his art, creating works that were raw, unbridled, and unapologetic. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau remained true to his own voice, a voice that spoke of the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world was a Sisyphean task, a task that seemed to weigh heavily upon his shoulders. For, despite his dedication to his craft, he was a latecomer to the world of art, and the likes of Matisse were already making a name for themselves. Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, notes the stark contrast between the two artists - Matisse, driven by a desire to avoid the mundane, and Rousseau, driven by a desire to be accepted by the very establishment he longed to upend. \"Matisse was a painter who recoiled at the thought of painting in a trite way,\" Gordon writes, \"while Rousseau's ambition was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be welcomed into the fold of the Artiste Français.\"\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau's inner turmoil is laid bare, a canvas of contradictions where the desire for recognition and creative freedom wrestle for dominance. It is a painting that speaks to the artist's own personal struggle, a struggle that would continue to haunt him until the end of his days.",
            "In the desolate landscape of existence, some have posited a kinship between the labyrinthine realms of ethics and aesthetics. The affinity between truth and beauty, like the unyielding grip of a winter's night, has beckoned scholars and thinkers for centuries. As John Keats so poignantly etched in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The ephemeral nature of our understanding, gleaned from the crucible of education or experience, bespeaks a deeper, almost primal connection between the ostensibly disparate realms of morality and art.\n\nWe find ourselves drawn to the mysteries of ethics and aesthetics, like moths to the flickering flame of a spent candle, without the need for explicit instruction. These twin pursuits are, in essence, attempts to grasp the ungraspable, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral, rather than to lay down a set of proscriptions or prescriptions. Our analyses of art and morality, though they may delve into the minutiae of style, form, and context, ultimately fall short of capturing the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that sets a masterpiece apart.\n\nConsider the iconic Mona Lisa, for instance. Our discussions of her enigmatic smile may revolve around notions of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these explanations only gesture toward the truth, rather than revealing it. When asked to defend our favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to the enigmatic phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" as if to acknowledge the existence of a transcendent quality that defies capture.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's astute observation, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate,\" speaks to the intransigent nature of art and morality. Regardless of how extensively we catalog the properties of a work of literature, there remains an unbridgeable chasm between our descriptions and the work itself. Ethics, too, inhabits this realm of the unutterable.\n\nAs Wittgenstein so eloquently phrased it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendence, this unspoken essence, that constitutes the most potent bond between ethics and aesthetics. This synergy is especially pronounced in the realm of literature, where the nexus of art and morality is inextricably entwined. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"\n\nLiving, in all its messy, beautiful complexity, is inextricably bound up with values. Literature, that most human of arts, speaks directly to this fundamental aspect of our existence. It is through literature that we find a reflection of our own humanity, with all its attendant virtues and frailties. As we navigate the desolate landscape of existence, it is literature that provides a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is beauty to be found, and truth to be grasped, however fleetingly.",
            "In the shadow of the alps, where the mountains touch the sky, lies a land forged from the fires of disparate cultures. Germany, a nation born of the confluence of ancient tribes and the whispers of a storied past. From the distant echoes of the Baltic Sea's lapping waves to the majesty of the Elbe's gentle flow, the essence of Germany's being seeps from the very marrow of its stones. In the cities of München and Kiel, in Köln's riverine heart and Dresden's Saxon soul, the cultural currents swirl and eddy, a testament to the land's polyphonic heritage.\n\nThe name Germania, a byword for the ancestral home of the Germans, is a mystery shrouded in the mists of time. Scholars and historians debate the etymology of this moniker, some tracing its roots to the Tungrian tribe, others to the spear-like \"ger\" wielded by these ancient warriors. Perhaps, as the Gauls themselves may have whispered to Julius Caesar, it was a term born of their own tongue, a neighborly nod to the fierce and unyielding people beyond the Rhine.\n\nIn the annals of history, the Roman writer Tacitus penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, extolling their unyielding ferocity and aboriginal roots. \"I regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races,\" he wrote, as if to underscore the singularity of their bloodline. But what of those who would seek to leave the warmth of Italy for the unforgiving lands of Germania? Who would brave the tempests and the wilds for a distant, windswept home? Certainly not the Romans, who would send their legions to plunder the riches of Germania, but rarely, if ever, settle among its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes coalesced in the first century, they dwelled on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and their skills, yet refusing to be subsumed by the imperial giant. And so, Germany's story unfolded, a tapestry woven from the disparate threads of history, culture, and the indomitable will of its people.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind vacant, a canvas unblemished by the turmoil that churned within. The scene before me unfolded like a desolate landscape, devoid of meaning or significance. My thoughts drifted, ephemeral whispers that vanished as swiftly as they appeared, leaving naught but the stark, unadorned reality. My consciousness flowed like a dark, uncharted river, unmoored from the anchors of emotion or attachment.\n\nIn a bygone era, I had sought to harness the mysteries of creation, to capture the essence of the world on paper. I had pored over the words of an artist, a sage who had counseled me to grasp the fundamentals of art. He spoke of a world beyond the mundane, a realm where the boundaries of reality were stretched and reshaped. His teachings had led me to The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome that promised to unleash my inner artist. I had devoured its pages, drunk in the secrets of perception and interpretation.\n\nA technique had caught my eye, a simple yet profound exercise: the rectangle of observation. By enclosing a scene within a square frame, one could tame the chaos, reduce the complexities to a manageable whole. I had attempted to apply this lesson to the still life before me, but my mind had faltered, overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of details. The bowl, the fruit, the table, the kitchen, the dining room - all these elements swirled together in a maelstrom of sensory input, leaving me reeling.\n\nYet, even as I stood there, transfixed by the sight, a spark within me ignited. The flame of artistic expression flickered to life, casting a warm, golden glow over the scene. I saw it: Work in Brown, a masterpiece unfolding before my very eyes. My fingers trembled with anticipation as I reached for the pencil, my hand hovering above the page like a bird poised on the branch of a winter tree.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. The respite was shattered by the urgent call of nature. I turned away from the canvas, my hand clenching into a fist as I grasped the handle of the toilet. The offending mass of brown, a detritus of civilization, refused to yield to my will. I flushed, and flushed again, but still it remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence. My hand, now a living thing, jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the recalcitrant mass.\n\nAs I stood there, my knuckles white with frustration, my mind slipped back into its default mode, a state of numbness and detachment. I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of filth and waste, and felt nothing. My gaze drifted to the wall, my hand reaching out to grasp the roll of toilet paper, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos. I clenched my hand into a fist once more, then, with a slow, deliberate movement, dipped it into the bowl, as if surrendering to the void.",
            "In the bleak expanse of American roads, a deadly vector cuts through the youth of the nation. Teenagers, with the fragile weight of inexperience, surrender to the hazards of driving. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth: the teen brain, still in its formative stages, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Simple inexperience, a wanton disregard for the unforgiving laws of physics, and an innate propensity for risk-taking propel the youngest drivers toward calamity.\n\nA study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, like a cold wind through a desolate landscape, reveals a stark correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents occur. The statistics are a stark testament to the treacherous terrain of adolescence, where the siren's call of peer pressure lures the unwary into the jaws of danger.\n\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to stem the tide of carnage with provisional driver's licenses, a stopgap measure that restricts the hours of driving and prohibits minors from riding shotgun. Yet, as a seasoned observer, it is clear that these measures are but a feeble bulwark against the deluge of death that threatens to engulf the youngest drivers.\n\nA more profound understanding, one that acknowledges the inherent limitations of the adolescent mind, is needed. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19 or 20 is too early for the unencumbered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of risk, a siren's call that beckons to the young, must be tempered by the wisdom of experience.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the death toll will continue to rise, a macabre tally that will only deepen with the advent of a new generation of drivers. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's offspring will flood the roads, a tidal wave of inexperience and hubris that will shatter the fragile safety net of existing regulations.\n\nA legislative solution, straightforward and unencumbered by the complexities of bureaucratic red tape, is at hand. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, issued prior to the granting of a full license, can still serve as a stepping stone, accompanied by a requisite number of practical driver's training hours. The specific number of hours, a figure that can be drawn from the experience of existing states (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult), will serve as a benchmark for a generation.\n\nUniform, national legislation on this issue is a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding the nation's youth. This is not a novel idea, but a necessary step in the face of an unfolding catastrophe. The lives of countless teenagers hang in the balance, like autumn leaves on a gusty day. We must not falter in our duty to protect them.",
            "In the dusty stacks of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, I chanced upon a collection of trick films, their numbers dwindling to fifteen from the fleeting years of 1895 to 1901. These short-lived spectacles, born of creative manipulation, relied on the art of editing to weave illusions. My pursuit led me to delve into the poetic underpinnings of the majority of these trick films, as well as the aberrant characteristics that emerged in a few of the later productions. It became apparent that the trick films of the era adhered to a set of strict parameters, their composition relegated to a static frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, reliant upon long and medium shots, and bound by the unyielding rule of one shot equaling one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few of these early films dared to challenge these conventions, introducing novelties such as multiple shots. However, an examination of the trick films as a whole reveals a common thread - their reliance on interior settings, framed by the imposing proscenium arch of the theatre. The camera, unmoving and unyielding, captured the action within this artificial realm, its perspective rooted in the traditions of theatre and vaudeville, where the magic of illusion reigned supreme.\n\nA fundamental limitation of this approach was the restriction it placed on the movement of figures within the frame. They could only traverse the horizontal axis, their trajectory confined to a linear path, never venturing towards or away from the camera. A case in point is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors appear from the right side, their movements confined to a narrow, horizontal plane. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoving and unyielding.\n\nThe static composition of the frontal proscenium also dictated that shots be predominantly long, with medium shots appearing only sporadically. Close-ups, a staple of later cinematic storytelling, were an anomaly in these early trick films, their absence a reflection of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the entire performance was presented within the frame of the stage. Actors remained fixed in the middle ground, their movements never drawing them towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating a single film, a constraint that limited their length to a mere minute or less, depending on the frame rate employed. This restriction stifled the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which predominantly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching illusions, bereft of a coherent story. However, a closer examination of these trick films reveals that a single \"shot\" may actually comprise multiple physical shots, expertly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that, upon closer inspection, reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a long-forgotten past, a figure emerged, his name etched in the annals of history - John Taylor of Caroline. A stalwart advocate for the Republican creed, his fervor burned with an unyielding passion for the principles of personal freedom and limited governance. Though his roots lay in the fertile soil of agriculture, his forays into politics sowed the seeds of a man unyielding in his convictions. His dedication to the agrarian way of life was the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were forged.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the chains of native tradition, Taylor believed the United States held the promise of crafting an ideal system, one where self-government could flourish unencumbered. He espoused the natural rights of man, arguing that they were inextricably linked, that the denial of one right would imperil the others, rendering them worthless. These rights, he contended, must remain beyond the grasp of the government, untainted by the rot of despotism.\n\nTaylor's worldview was predicated on a dualistic morality, a stark dichotomy between good and evil. He believed that government, as exercised by man, was susceptible to both virtues and vices. In his estimation, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, nurtured agriculture, and checked the rapacious tendencies of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles would, he argued, function equitably, untainted by the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he averred, was an inescapable fact of human nature, but one that became pernicious only when it gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the weak.\n\nTo prevent the ascendancy of bad principles, Taylor advocated for a government of strict construction, one that operated within the narrow confines of the Constitution's explicit provisions. He shuddered at the prospect of an expansive Federal government, its power and rights unchecked, a potential harbinger of despotism. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, recognizing that such an approach could lead to corruption. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's nature as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "A precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project brought a fleeting sense of unease. The causes behind this decline remained shrouded in mystery, a void to be filled by conjecture and speculation. The creeping onset of winter, with its wintry grasp on the New England campus, may have contributed to a decline in commutes by bicycle or foot. The hectic end to the fall semester, when students were consumed by the final throes of schoolwork and the inevitable processing of grades, may have also played a part. The holidays, a month-long respite from the demands of academia, further siphoned off interest, leaving the commuter log to gather dust on a forgotten shelf.\n\nA growing awareness of the cyclical nature of project momentum crept into our thoughts - a burst of energy at the outset, followed by a natural decline. We endeavored to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a concentrated effort to revive the initiative in March. Though it yielded a temporary increase in log submissions, it begged the question: how to sustain momentum in the face of inherent fluctuations. The problem of holiday and semester breaks, a recurring affliction for higher education, presented a particular challenge.\n\nA more insidious foe, however, lay at the heart of our struggles: the deeply ingrained notion that personal freedom, independence, and flexibility are inextricably linked to the freedom to drive. A cultural paradigm, stubborn and resistant to change. We attempted to counter this with incentives - gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. Yet, a nagging doubt persisted: could we have done more to combat the decline? Would larger, more substantial prizes - a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car - have been the catalyst for increased participation? The allure of these prizes, announced in December and January, may have been enough to rekindle interest and spark renewed engagement.\n\nThe prizes, however, remained static throughout the project. A gentle wind, blowing softly at the outset, gradually lost its force, failing to sustain the momentum we had worked so hard to build. If only we had announced a series of escalating incentives, each one more tantalizing than the last, perhaps our efforts would have borne fruit. Alas, the gift cards, once sufficient, gradually lost their luster, unable to stem the tide of waning interest.",
            "In a world where the markets roamed like a barren wasteland, a creature emerged - the ETF, a security born of human ingenuity, designed to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets like a beast tracking its prey. It was a creature of flexibility, trading like a stock on an exchange, yet offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership. The ETF's allure was palpable, a siren's call to the savviest of investors, promising the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.\n\nYet, like the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world, there existed a darker side to the ETF, a reminder that even in a world of abundance, there were costs to be paid. The expense ratios, a barren wasteland of fees, stood as a testament to the ETF's true nature. And so, the investor must navigate this landscape, weighing the benefits of diversification against the costs of commissions, a constant reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can turn out to be a pitfall.\n\nThe ETF IHF, a particular specimen of this breed, held within it a secret: its top 10 holdings, a diverse assemblage of assets that comprised 63.58% of its assets. Like a treasure trove hidden deep within the ruins of a forgotten city, these holdings held the key to understanding the ETF's true nature. By examining the top 10 holdings, one could gain insight into the ETF's very essence, and perhaps, uncover a hidden truth - that the benefits of owning a single ETF might not be as great as they seemed.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of the ETF IHF, one must first evaluate its holdings, a task akin to navigating a treacherous landscape. By using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, one could estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations, a complex dance of numbers, revealed a startling truth: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings could provide a 6.11% higher return, a 16% increase in returns, compared to the ETF as a whole.\n\nBut like the fragile balance of the post-apocalyptic world, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was 0.12 lower than the ETF's, a delicate balance that could be easily upset. The question remained: were these portfolios statistically different? To answer this, one must delve into the realm of standard deviation, a measure of the variability of returns. By determining the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalizing it to 100%, one could compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.\n\nAs the sun set on this desolate landscape, the investor was left with a choice: to venture forth into the unknown, or to retreat to the safety of the familiar. The ETF IHF, like the post-apocalyptic world, was a place of wonder and terror, where the benefits of diversification and flexibility beckoned, but the costs of commissions and fees lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike. Only time would tell if the ETF IHF would prove to be a savior or a curse, a creature of the market that would lead the investor to prosperity or destruction.",
            "In the depths of his fevered imagination, a realm of shadows beckoned, one that Edgar Allan Poe had all but claimed as his own, a place he called Dream-Land. It was a world born of his darker musings, a twisted tapestry woven from the threads of his own tortured soul. And in this desolate landscape, a word echoed, a word that would serve as a harbinger of his descent into the abyss: Thulé.\n\nPoe's fascination with this term was not born of the void, but rather from the influence of a master wordsmith, the German bard Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe's own works, particularly the poetic drama Faust, had left an indelible mark on Poe's psyche. It was in Faust's second part, a somber and mournful tale, that Poe would find the germ of his own creative seed. A poem, \"The King of Thulé\", told the tragic tale of a king who, bereft of his beloved wife, succumbed to the darkness, his spirit shattered by the memories of his lost love.\n\nIn this twisted doppelganger of his own loss, Poe would find a kinship, a reflection of his own mortal coil. The King of Thulé's descent into madness, his drinking and despair, mirrored Poe's own struggles with the demon of addiction. And it was in this same work that Poe would find the term Thulé, a word that would become the leitmotif of his own dark musings.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" was no mere happenstance. It was a deliberate nod to Goethe, a acknowledgement of the debt he owed to the German master. And in \"Dream-Land\", the landscape of Thulé was a twisted reflection of the King's own desolate realm, a world devoid of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nIt was a testament to Poe's reverence for Goethe that he would draw inspiration from the German's works, weaving them into the very fabric of his own creative tapestry. Poe's admiration for the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was well-documented, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his psyche. The echoes of Thulé, a word born of Goethe's imagination, would haunt Poe's own, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within, waiting to consume him whole.\n\nIn the end, it was not the void that had spawned Dream-Land, but the creative ferment of Goethe's genius, a wellspring of inspiration that would fuel Poe's own descent into the abyss. And in the shadows of Thulé, Poe would find a reflection of his own mortality, a grim reminder that the darkness was always present, waiting to claim him whole.",
            "In the shadow of California's statutes, a question lingers: can a customer, injured by the negligence of a grocery store, claim punitive damages against the store's manager, who, informed of a spill, chose not to act, distracted as he was by the mundane act of eating dinner? The judge, a sentinel of justice, is unlikely to dismiss the claim summarily. To grant punitive damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable, an affront to the very notion of decency.\n\nJennifer Palmer's claim, though precarious, is not without merit. She can argue that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of neglecting to clean the spill, given the history of similar incidents at the store. Six slip-and-fall accidents had occurred in the preceding year, and still Martin failed to take action to safeguard his customers. This is not the act of a manager concerned with the well-being of those who enter his store. It is, rather, a callous disregard for the safety of others, a dereliction of duty that can be characterized as despicable.\n\nThe chronology of events is telling. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but Martin, distracted by his dinner, chose to ignore the warning. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same indifference. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of Martin's inaction became apparent.\n\nCalifornia's civil code provides that a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, in this context, is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Id. at § (c)(1). In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979), the court characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, despite the defendant's awareness of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's inaction in the face of multiple warnings of the spill can be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers. His failure to clean the spill, despite the history of similar incidents, demonstrates a callous disregard for the well-being of others. It is a conduct that can be characterized as despicable, a breach of the duty of care owed to those who enter his store. The question remains: will justice be served, or will the manager's negligence be excused? Only time will tell.",
            "Four years past, I had taken a course in the scriptures of Islam at a small university. The disquisitions of our class were often heated, centered around a question that has come to seem more pertinent than ever: can Islam be considered a hostile faith? In the time since the calamity of 9/11, I have observed the mass media shift from a profound distrust of Islam to an almost sycophantic tolerance. A presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, a man whose heritage was deeply rooted in the Islamic faith, was unthinkable in the year 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet has long fascinated me, for it appears to contradict the persona one might expect. I had long believed that Muhammad was a man who forced his will upon others, subjugating tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. Yet, the biography presents a different narrative altogether: that of a man humbled by the trials of his life, a man who was often misunderstood and mistreated by his contemporaries. It was only through his unwavering commitment to his convictions that people began to see the truth in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nThere are eerie parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, which served to feed a company of forty men. The style of writing employed in this account has led me to believe that the authors sought to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in accordance with the truth. This is a kind of fallacy, for it diminishes the true nature of Jesus Christ. It is as if they are attempting to claim Jesus' life and personhood as their own, to usurp his identity and significance.\n\nFurthermore, the biography is replete with stories that seem designed to provide proof of the veracity of Muhammad's teachings. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-person perspective, often through a chain of witnesses. This approach diminishes the stories' impact, making them seem suspect and less credible. The overall effect is one of attempted proof, rather than a genuine attempt to convey the truth.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a position of moral superiority, to portray him as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, the historical record suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was not marked by gentleness or humility. I am compelled to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's ascension to greatness.",
            "Beyond the dusty tomes and the scribes who penned the words, the teachings of Jesus lay abandoned, forsaken in the desert of time. The Christ he had preached, the love he had embodied, the words he had spoken - all these were lost to the ravages of history, consumed by the slow hunger of tradition. And yet, even as the ages passed, a glimmer remained, a faint embers of a fire that once had burned so brightly. For in the depths of the human heart, there was a yearning, a stirring, a sense that something had been lost, that the truth had been obscured by the accretions of dogma and doctrine.\n\nIt was as if the clock of Christian thought had been turned back, the hands unwinding, the gears clicking into reverse, as men and women sought to reclaim the original intent of the founder. A great reversal, a turning back, a stripping away of the extraneous, the unnecessary, the false. The layers of centuries, of dogma, of tradition, would be peeled back, like the tender skin of a fruit, until only the essence remained, the pure, unadulterated essence of the man who had lived, who had walked, who had spoken, who had loved.\n\nAnd when this reversal came, as come it would, to the shores of America, to the heart of Europe, the church would stand, strong and unyielding, a beacon in the darkness, a guide on the path back to the source. But it would not be the same church that had existed before, for theologically, the clock would have turned back, and the diversity that had grown, like a great and sprawling vine, would wither and die, leaving only the branches of a single, unbranching tree, its leaves all alike, its roots deep and unshakeable.\n\nFor in the end, it was not the diversity of doctrine, the multiplicity of interpretation, that had ever truly led to the truth, but the unity, the simplicity, the singleness of purpose. And so, the great reversion would come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a reclaiming of the original intent. It would be a journey, a pilgrimage, a return to the beginning, and when it was done, the world would be still, and quiet, and the only sound would be the gentle rustling of leaves, the soft whisper of the wind through the trees.\n\nBut what happened, in the long unfolding of time, since Jesus walked among men? We must go back, far back, to the Jewish roots, to the soil from which Christianity sprang, to the monotheistic wellspring, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. And we will find, in that far-off time, a people, a people divided, fragmented, at odds with one another - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, a multitude, a sea of faces, each one unique, each one different, each one, in its own way, searching for the truth.",
            "In the festering heart of the city, a grotesque litany of humanity's true nature unfolded. Like a diseased and fest'ring wound, the jungle of Packingtown revealed the base and self-serving inclinations that lay hidden beneath the veneer of civilization. The titans of industry, devoid of compassion, reveled in their pursuit of power and wealth, crushing all in their path with an unyielding fervor. Theirs was a world of unrelenting avarice, where the almighty dollar reigned supreme and the well-being of others was but a distant afterthought.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words dripped like acid, searing the pages with a clear-eyed vision, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The very landscape itself seemed to writhe in agony, a testament to the unfettered greed that had ravaged the land. The owners and managers, devoid of empathy, callously disregarded the lives of those caught in the maelstrom of their machinations, heedless of the noxious plumes of smoke that choked the air or the festering pools of animal waste that polluted the rivers.\n\nTheir indifference to human life was matched only by their callous disregard for the well-being of their employees. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The factory owners and managers reduced their workers to mere commodities, pawns in a game of profit and loss, where the only currency that mattered was the almighty dollar. They worked their employees to the brink of collapse, with nary a care for their safety or well-being, and discarded them like so much trash when they were no longer useful.\n\nThe era of The Jungle was a time when the law was a distant memory, and the powerful preyed upon the weak with abandon. The workers toiled in squalid conditions, their bodies broken and their spirits crushed by the unyielding machine that was Packingtown. There were no safety nets to catch them when they fell, no aid to lift them up when they stumbled. The unions, formed to protect the workers, often served only to line the pockets of those who exploited them. And so, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and suffering, their lives reduced to a mere existence, a living hell of desperation and despair, as Sinclair so starkly described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the epoch of literary craftsmanship, authors have harnessed the power of linguistic tools to inculcate specific emotions and perceptions within their readers. Some techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master of subtlety, employs a range of methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs nouns and adjectives in unexpected conjunctions to create a certain aura around a subject. Fitzgerald also expertly applies significance to symbols, utilizing them to convey profound meaning. He is particularly adept at imbuing colors with emotional resonance, using them to evoke a particular sentiment in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald's manipulation of white and gray is a prime example of this technique. He begins by building a rich tapestry of meaning around these colors, gradually imbuing them with distinct connotations. White, in his narrative, represents a refined, high-class quality, while gray denotes a more aged, faded essence. This dichotomy is evident in the opening chapters, where Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors to create a sense of uniformity. The protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are often clad in white, while characters like Tom and Gatsby are frequently associated with white attire. Even the setting itself is not immune to this color coding, with the \"white chasms of lower New York\" serving as a stark contrast to the gaudy primary colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by assigning these colors to mundane objects and individuals. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, while the names of people at Gatsby's gatherings are reduced to \"gray names\" on his timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" underscoring the idea of uniformity. Even the people and places themselves are not immune to this color coding, with Jordan and Daisy sharing a \"white girlhood\" and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad being described as \"gray.\"\n\nIt is only after Fitzgerald has established this rich tapestry of meaning that he employs white and gray to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, reappears dressed in white in a \"little white roadster.\" This visual cue serves to recontextualize Daisy, transforming her from a complex character to a mere uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald reinforces this interpretation by employing similar color coding around Daisy, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's fateful encounter.",
            "The land on which he stood, scorched by the sun and ravaged by the wind, was a testament to the despair that had consumed all that once lived. And yet, in this desolate expanse, there was a glimmer of hope. San Diego County, a place where the relentless sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, was a land of plenty. The crops that grew there - the tomatoes, the citrus, the leafy greens, and the squash - were a testament to the fertility of the earth. But of all these, the organic farms stood apart, a beacon of resistance against the tide of desolation.\n\nThese farms, tended by the hands of those who toiled in the sun, were a bastion of life. They stood in stark contrast to the barren fields that stretched out before them, a testament to the beauty that could be wrought from the earth. The leafy greens, a verdant oasis in a sea of desolation, were a reminder of what could be achieved through hard work and dedication. The squash, a symbol of resilience, stood tall and proud, its vines stretching out like a lifeline to the parched earth.\n\nBut the organic farms of San Diego County were not without their costs. The labor was intensive, the management a Sisyphean task that required constant vigilance.

            "Culture is a cipher, an enigma whose meaning shifts with each attempt to grasp it. It is not a fixed entity, but a web of intersecting threads that weave together to form an intricate tapestry. To think of culture as a singular thing, static and unyielding, is to misunderstand its very essence. The notion that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is a reduction of the complex, a simplification that does little justice to the rich nuances of human experience.\n\nWhen we approach a foreign culture, we do so through the lens of our own. We draw comparisons, and in doing so, we risk imposing our own values and biases upon the unknown. To truly understand a culture, one must be willing to listen, to learn, and to embrace the unfamiliar. This is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its existence, its strengths, and its weaknesses. In the realm of negotiation, this understanding is paramount, especially when one finds oneself in a position of weakness.\n\nCulture knows no national borders, nor does it reside solely in the realm of the international. It permeates every aspect of our lives, from the corporate world to our personal relationships. A company's culture can be as rigid as a hierarchical structure or as fluid as a flat organizational chart. It can be seen in the dress code, the communication style, and the hiring practices. Some companies value long hours, while others prioritize work-life balance. Some cultures place great emphasis on saving face, while others value transparency above all else.\n\nAt its core, culture is a web of values, a delicate balance of what is considered acceptable and what is not. A negotiator must be aware of these values, for they will shape the course of the negotiation. If saving face is paramount, a negotiator will avoid public confrontation at all costs. If a hard-driven bargain is the goal, they will not settle for anything less. Understanding these values is crucial, but it is equally important to learn about the individual, to find common ground, and to build a connection.\n\nIn the end, culture is a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions and paradoxes. To navigate its twists and turns, one must be patient, observant, and willing to learn. For it is in the subtleties of culture that we find the key to effective negotiation, a key that can unlock even the most stubborn of doors.",
            "The passage from Psalm 14, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" serves as a foreboding backdrop to our examination of the arguments for the existence of God put forth by St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Like a barren landscape, their thoughts on the divine are scorched by the desolation of doubt, each seeking to illuminate a path to the unknown. We must navigate this desolate terrain, where the weight of their words hangs heavy, to discern whose argument is more convincing.\n\nIn traversing this barren expanse, we find ourselves in the company of Anselm, whose journey begins within the confines of his own mind. He posits that the existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that the proof of the divine lies within the recesses of our own soul. Like a traveler seeking shelter from the storm, Anselm finds solace in the knowledge that the existence of God is not something to be discovered, but rather something to be intuited. The idea that truth can be found within the labyrinth of our own minds is a notion that resonates deeply with the concept of faith, an unyielding conviction that guides the believer through the darkness.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas embarks on a different path, one that traverses the realm of reason and empirical evidence. Like a cartographer charting a new territory, Aquinas seeks to map the contours of the divine through the use of logic and observation. He presents five separate arguments, each one a testament to the power of reason in uncovering the existence of God. The puzzle of existence, with its missing piece, is a metaphor that Aquinas employs to illustrate the inescapable necessity of the divine. Like a master craftsman, he demonstrates that the proof of God is not something that can be seen, but rather something that can be deduced from the intricate web of causality and contingency that governs the universe.\n\nIn the end, it is not our task to declare a victor, but rather to acknowledge the inherent value in each of their arguments. For in the desolate landscape of doubt, their words serve as beacons, guiding us through the darkness towards a glimmer of understanding. Yet, like two travelers on a winding road, we cannot help but feel that their paths converge, each one leading us towards the same destination – a place where faith and reason intersect, and the existence of God becomes a reality that cannot be denied.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a prince was born, one whose name would eventually be spoken in reverence as the Buddha. Beyond the ravages of centuries, his teachings continue to shape the lives of his followers, their essence distilled into the Theravada sect—a tradition forged in the crucible of his enlightenment. Like the dry riverbeds that crisscross the barren lands, the religion has evolved, its waters seasonally swollen by the capricious tides of history. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a testament to the unlikely convergence of the sacred and the mundane. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ritual, their footsteps tracing the forgotten paths of their ancestors, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. The differences that have arisen over the centuries—some say like the shifting sands of the desert—stretch from the surface trappings of tradition to the very bedrock of the faith.\n\nAs the winds of time howl through the Theravada Buddhist community, the doctrine has been shaped by forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These terms will be employed throughout this discussion: internal forces emanating from the very heart of the Buddhasasana, while external forces arise from the outside world, oblivious to the sacred. Hostile forces, like the ravaging storms that sweep across the land, seek to damage or destroy the community, their malevolent intentions fueled by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may be beneficial or detrimental, their impact a byproduct of their actions, like the unpredictable fallout from a distant earthquake.\n\nThe foundation of Theravada Buddhism lies in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and complex edifice, is comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These concepts—Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades existence; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things—are the keys to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, the Samsara that binds us to the wheel of suffering. Alongside Samsara, the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will be extinguished, as one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a code of conduct for laymen and monks alike, five precepts for the former (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), and a more complex set of rules for the latter. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the recognition that attachment fuels suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be vanquished.",
            "Two nations, like ancient adversaries, had long squared off on the stage of the Americas. The United States and Mexico, their rivalry a winding path of contention that meandered through the decades, a 57-year odyssey of discord that finally began to subside just as the world was plunged into the darkness of the Great War. The high-water mark of this antagonism was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, its ambitions sated by the acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe rivalry's genesis lay in the incompatibility of their cultures, their histories and traditions clashing like titans in a maelstrom of conflicting interests. The die was cast, and the two nations were drawn into a vortex of enmity, their mutual distrust fueled by the sullen embers of their colonial past.\n\nAs the years unfolded, their differences coalesced into a rigid dichotomy, a chasm that seemed as unbridgeable as the great divides that scarred the American landscape. Religion, a potent force in this crucible of discord, had become a fault line that rent the two nations asunder. The United States, its gaze fixed on the horizon, saw in Mexico a bastion of Catholicism, a theological monolith that threatened its own Protestant heritage. And Mexico, its eyes cast in the opposite direction, perceived the United States as a scourge, a behemoth that sought to impose its will upon the world.\n\nThe echoes of this animosity resonated through the ages, a refrain that was to be heard in the tumultuous relations between the two nations. The borderlands, a vast expanse of dust and rock, became a proving ground for their rivalry, a battleground where the protagonists clashed in a series of skirmishes and battles that seemed to have no end. David M. Pletcher's words, penned in the twilight of the 20th century, seemed to capture the essence of this enduring enmity: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\"\n\nThe legacy of this rivalry, a testament to the enduring power of historical enmity, continued to cast a long shadow over the relations between the two nations. Even as the world around them changed, the United States and Mexico remained locked in a dance of distrust, their steps choreographed by the residual animosity of their colonial past. And so, like two titans of old, they stood on the stage of the Americas, their rivalry a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of history to shape the destinies of nations.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the disputes between the United States and Mexico accumulated, a tally of 17 recorded conflicts that marked the 57-year span of their rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, the borderlands a flashpoint for their antagonism. Border raids by bandits and outlaws, a perpetual thorn in their side, were a constant reminder of the distrust that had taken root between them. It was only as the United States began to exert its influence over Mexico, its power and wealth casting a long shadow over the latter, that the rivalry began to subside. And when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the stage was set for a new chapter in the complex and often fraught history of the United States and Mexico.",
            "The shadow of illness crept over me like a shroud fifteen years past, its presence a whispered rumor of a life unlived. I was a nurse then, a tendril of stability in a world that had long been unsure. The mantra of safe harbor echoed through my formative years, a refrain that guided me toward a profession that promised solace and security. 'You'll always find work,' they said. People will always fall ill. And so I chose the path of nursing, leaving behind the dreams of science and journalism that lingered like a forgotten melody.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, had other plans. I was 46, single, and bereft of resources, unable to work. The years since have been a grueling dance, a daily struggle to eke out an existence on the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. And though I've survived, the landscape of my life is now a barren expanse, devoid of certainties. The only constant is the knowledge that I owe my very survival to the kindness of loved ones and a few scattered friends. It is a truth that echoes through the desolate chambers of my heart: in the face of disaster, strength is a fleeting illusion.\n\nThis is a lesson that will be etched in my mind forever: in the darkness of true need, our grasp on self-sufficiency falters. The notion that we can weather any storm alone is a myth, a comforting fiction that shatters when the winds of adversity howl. And so, I implore you: let us not be fooled by the siren song of rugged individualism. It was not the unyielding spirit of the pioneers that carried them across the Rockies, but the gentle hand of compassion, the shared burden of mutual respect, and the mutual aid that bound them together.\n\nI am prepared, oh yes. I have a disaster kit, a cache of first aid supplies, water purifiers, and the tools of self-sufficiency. But I know that these are mere trinkets against the tempests that rage. True safety lies not in the solitary vigilance of the individual, but in the collective bond of our communities. Get to know your neighbors, I say. For in their faces, you will find the threads that weave the tapestry of our humanity.",
            "It is a query that has puzzled the minds of men for ages: what drives the evolution of life in the manner that it does? Are there unseen forces that shape the trajectory of change, or are we merely subject to the whims of chance? The answer, much like the world itself, remains shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, who first dared to dream of defining the organic forms of life in mathematical terms, would be astonished at how little we have since progressed. Yet, it is in the darkness of the unknown that we find our greatest opportunity for discovery.\n\nRecently, the application of mathematical modeling to the study of mollusk development has shed new light on the mechanisms of change. In our own research, we have sought to apply this approach to the genus Prunum, combining theoretical models with experimental studies to unlock the secrets of evolutionary development. Through the use of X-radiographic images, we have identified key parameters that govern the shape and form of these creatures, which we have then used to model hypothetical and actual morphologies. Our findings are slowly beginning to reveal the hidden patterns that govern the direction and magnitude of change in this ancient lineage.\n\nA shell, that most fundamental of mollusk attributes, can be seen as a tube that winds its way through the passage of time, a spiral path that traverses the vast expanse of space. Each revolution of this tube is a whorl, a spiral coil that tightens around the central axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls unfold can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each one from its predecessor. The body whorl, the largest and final coil, stands as the crowning achievement of this magnificent structure, while the spire, a towering column of whorls, stretches towards the apex, the tip of this majestic spiral.\n\nShells can be viewed from a multitude of angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each offering a unique perspective on this intricate marvel. And it is in these views that we find the key to understanding the secrets of the shell's growth. By counting the whorls, we can chart the course of the aperture, that opening through which the creature extends its very being into the world. A line drawn from the first suture, a dividing line that splits the shell in two, allows us to estimate the whorls, each one a quarter of a full rotation.\n\nA shell, then, is a path that traverses the void, a journey through time and space that is inscribed on the very fabric of existence. By graphing the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, we can represent this trajectory in all its mathematical precision. And it is here, in this dark and mysterious realm, that we find the power to shape the very course of evolution itself.",
            "In the stillbirths and infant deaths of Indonesia, a stark truth lingers. For ten years, the rates have held fast, like monuments to the country's unyielding struggle. The Millennium Development Goals, a beacon in the darkness, once seemed within reach, but now recede like a mirage on a desert highway. Water and sanitation targets were met, yet child and maternal health lagged, a slow-moving tide of neglect. The reasons are manifold, a labyrinth of complexities that point to a deeper truth: the health system must be strengthened, rather than merely prodded by programmatic interventions.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickers in the statistics. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled attendant, a number that belies the harsh reality. Traditional workers, midwives, stand at the forefront, their aid limited to simple birthing, leaving the complicated cases to a cruel fate. The maternal deaths that follow, like specters, haunt the land. And though the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, the postnatal care remains a dark and foreboding void.\n\nCesarian-section rates hover at a paltry four percent, a meager number that underscores the disparities that ravage the land. Urban and rural settings diverge like two warring worlds, with a seven percent rate in cities and a meager two percent in the countryside. The chasm of equity yawns wide, a chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots. In the poorer quintiles, a 27 percent gap in service utilization gapes like an open wound, a testament to the cruel inequities that afflict the land.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of neonatal and maternal care, the question looms: how to stem the tide of neglect? Should the focus lie on program-specific approaches or on strengthening the health system as a whole, without succumbing to the siren song of targeted interventions? The allure of vertical approaches is great, with their manageable objectives and rapid results. But the drawbacks are equally profound. The funneling of resources to a particular area drains the coffers of others, drawing human resources like moths to a flame. The duplication of services, the cacophony of forms and paperwork, threatens to engulf the system in its own bureaucracy.",
            "In the staid and dusty realm of Victorian literature, a peculiar subset of novels defied the conventions of their time. These works, while bearing the hallmarks of the era, veered into uncharted territories of mystery and the bizarre. Two such novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, exemplified this departure, imbuing their characters with an air of enigmatic complexity. By embracing the unknown, these authors offered a glimpse into the innermost recesses of their protagonists' minds, laying bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the words of Charles Dickens swirled in the darkness, a maelstrom of confusion assailed the mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's bitter dispute still lingered, their voices a cacophony in the silence. The sound of gunfire shattered the air, and the protagonist found himself borne away on a tide of chaos, his senses reeling from the shock. A nagging awareness of pain gnawed at his consciousness, a constant reminder of the turmoil that beset him.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often served as a window into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his sorrow and his nascent understanding of the cruel fate that had befallen him. The shooting that had left him scarred, both physically and emotionally, was revisited in his dreams, a harrowing reenactment of the event that left him shaken and bereft of agency. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscored the sense of powerlessness that had come to define his existence, as if the very fabric of his reality had been torn asunder.\n\nThe passage was a litany of despair, a testament to the crushing weight of Oliver's circumstances. His helplessness in the face of adversity was palpable, a stark reminder that his fate was not his own to choose. The \"unseen hand\" that bore him away was a metaphor for the capricious nature of life, a cruel jest that left him reeling in its wake. As the darkness closed in, Oliver's sense of defeat grew, a sense of resignation that had been sown by the Machiavellian Fagin, who had insidiously eroded his will to resist.\n\nIn the darkness, time lost all meaning. The day succumbed to the night, a fleeting instant in the grand tapestry of existence. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all sense of purpose. Night's darkness was both long and short, a paradoxical existence that seemed to stretch on forever, yet vanish in an instant.\n\nJust as the day dissolved into the shadows, so too did the certainties of life. The unknown loomed, a vast and foreboding expanse that threatened to consume all in its path. And yet, it was in this very uncertainty that the characters of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights found their strength, their bond to the world around them forged in the crucible of mystery and the unknown.",
            "It was a time past, a time not so distant, when I walked among the after-school shadows, a tutor lost in the labyrinth of learning. The Elementary age students, their faces a blur of concern, their minds a jumble of confusion. I wandered through the halls of knowledge, a guide in search of the wayward. My hands, a calloused map of effort, guided the pencils, the books, the minds. The language of the land, a barrier to be bridged. I was recruited by a seasoned instructor to aid a young boy, Adrian, a name that would etch itself into my memory like a cipher on stone.\n\nHe was a boy of Latino descent, a mystery shrouded in the veil of language. His words, a symphony of mispronunciations, a cacophony of misunderstandings. It was as if the very alphabet itself had been turned on its head, its sounds a jumbled mess of confusion. I was stumped, a shipwreck on the shores of his understanding. That was until the day I met his mother, a woman of quiet resolve, her eyes a testament to the struggles she had faced. Her words, a gentle stream of Spanish, a language I struggled to follow, a language that lay beyond my grasp.\n\nThe revelation hit me like a tempest, a storm that ravaged my understanding. Adrian's problem was not one of comprehension, but of alphabet. The English language, a vast and complex tapestry, woven from threads of sound and sight. He knew the words, the meanings, but the symbols that represented them, the letters, these he did not know. It was a chasm, a gulf that separated him from the world of reading. I wondered if this epiphany would be the key to unlocking his potential, or just another stone in the tomb of his struggles.\n\nI share this tale, a cautionary story of the language barrier, a barrier that stands between the promise of education and the reality of understanding. In the hallowed halls of learning, a world away from the concerns of California's schools, I saw the truth. It is not always as obvious as we would think. The solution, a siren's call, beckons to us. But the answer, a will-o'-the-wisp, vanishes at our approach. The dual language system, a beacon of hope, shines bright, but its benefits are not limited to those whose first language is Spanish. It is a gift, a gift that can be shared by all.\n\nBut what of the fears that surround it? The doubts that whisper in our ears, that it is a waste of resources, a luxury we cannot afford? I say, let us not be swayed by these doubts. Let us not be afraid to challenge the status quo. For in the end, it is not the language of the majority that matters, but the language of the individual. And what of the teachers, the educators, the guides who lead us through the halls of learning? Do we require them to be bilingual? No, that would be a task too great, a burden too heavy. But let us not forget the special aids, the tutors, the guides who can bridge the gap, who can speak the language of the heart.\n\nThe key lies in combining the dual language system with the mainstream immersion, the private tutors, the ESL classes. It is a tapestry, a rich and complex weave of solutions, each one a thread in the narrative of understanding. We must not be afraid to experiment, to try new approaches, to push the boundaries of what we think is possible. For in the end, it is not the language that separates us, but our willingness to learn, to understand, to grow.\n\nAnd so, I leave you with this tale, a story of a boy, a boy who struggled with the alphabet, a boy who found his voice in the language of the heart. Let us not forget his story, let us not forget the lessons we have learned, let us not forget the power of language, the power of understanding, the power of the human spirit.",
            "The weight of the unknown settles heavy upon us from the earliest days.  A force beyond our grasp, a presence that defies comprehension.  Some turn to the sacred texts, the dogma of our forefathers, while others seek solace within the labyrinth of their own minds.  We are told to seek the divine, to find meaning in the grand tapestry of existence.  Yet, some reject this notion, choosing instead to chart their own course, to traverse the uncharted expanse of their own egocentric universe.  We twist and turn, adopting one creed only to shed it like a worn skin, embracing another in its place.  Through this journey, we seek to define ourselves, to find the light that pierces the darkness and guides us toward the warmth of the unknown.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, huddled on the porch as the rain lashed down, drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above.  He sat lost in thought, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon, his gaze a mix of searching and remembrance.  His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his body like a shroud.  His hair, once a robust thatch, had thinned, its sparse strands a stark reminder of his frailty.  I felt a creeping sense of dread, a sense of loss that I could not voice, for in speaking it aloud, I feared I would only make it more real.\n\nI leaned in, embracing him, trying to draw comfort from his presence.  We sat together, lost in the rhythm of the rain, our eyes fixed on some point beyond the veil of the present.  It was as if we were both suspended, trapped in the amber of that moment, unable to move, unable to break free from the gravitational pull of our grief.\n\nMy father passed into the great beyond just a few days shy of my twenty-second birthday, in the cold dark of December.  The chemo and radiation, those pitiless instruments of medicine, had prolonged his suffering, but I could not discern the value in this prolongation.  In the still of the night, I questioned the existence of a benevolent deity.  If such a being existed, I wondered, had it abandoned me long ago?\n\nI chose not to bear witness to his final moments.  I could not stomach the spectacle of life ebbing from his body, of the essence that made me taking its final breath.  I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died.  And so, I turned away, curling into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news that would forever change the course of my life.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.  No one called to offer solace, no one reached out to offer a comforting word.  In that desolate landscape of loss, I was left to navigate the ruins of my grief, alone and adrift in a world that seemed to have moved on without me.",
            "Time shattered, the Gothic novel like a mirror reflecting the ruin of all that is old and new. For in its depths, the oxymoron of the name \"Gothic\" speaks to the very heart of the genre's essence: an anachronism born of a bygone era, yet forged anew in the crucible of modernity. As Ian Watt so astutely observed, the Gothic novel is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" - a confluence of the antiquated and the modern, where the shadows of the past converge with the clarion call of the present.\n\nIn the dimly lit recesses of literary history, the Gothic novel emerged as a bastard child of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a work that wove together the threads of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition to create a new tapestry of expression. Like a ghost haunting the halls of time, the Gothic genre has lingered, its presence felt yet forever displaced from the moment of its conception. And it was Walpole, a master weaver of contradictions, who first forged the links between the old and the new, the theatrical and the natural, to give birth to the Gothic novel.\n\nThe word \"gothic\" itself had long been a cipher, a term that conjured up images of an archaic, unsophisticated people, a byword for all that was considered inferior in the face of modern progress. Yet, it was precisely this paradox that fueled the Gothic novel's enduring power, its ability to blend the excesses of the past with the innovations of the present. The marriage of the Gothic and the novelistic form, with its emphasis on the inner lives of its characters, allowed the genre to transcend time and space, speaking to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most potent legacies of the Gothic tradition is the ideal of chivalry, that quintessential medieval code of honor and virtue. In the hands of Walpole and his ilk, chivalry became a fetish, a symbol of a lost golden age of heroism and nobility. Through the lens of chivalry, the Gothic novelists peered into the abyss of their own time, critiquing the shortcomings of their contemporaries and yearning for a bygone era of glory. Frederic, the hero of The Castle of Otranto, embodies this ideal, a prince of unimpeachable honor, forged in the crucible of suffering and tragedy. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a gallant and courteous knight.\n\nYet, as with all things Gothic, excess lurks just beneath the surface. Frederic's chivalry is an exaggeration, a caricature of the very ideals he represents. And it is this excess, this over-the-top romanticism, that gives the Gothic novel its peculiar, unsettling power. Like a dark mirror reflecting the pathologies of its creators, the Gothic novel holds up a vision of a distorted world, one where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the very fabric of society seems to unravel.\n\nIn the end, the Gothic novel remains a forever-displaced entity, a creature of the liminal spaces between past and present, old and new. Its power lies in its ability to evoke the terrible sublime, to conjure up a world of darkness and wonder, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present. And it is this very oxymoron, this blend of the old and the new, that continues to haunt us still, a ghostly presence that haunts the halls of literature, a reminder of the enduring power of the Gothic novel to shape our perceptions of the world, and ourselves.",
            "In the bleak landscape of commerce, a labyrinthine network of processes unwinds, a serpentine path of goods from the customer's desire to the raw materials stage, through supply, production, and distribution to the final destination. This was the concept born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a sage of industry. He laid bare the intricate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satiate the customer's needs with haste and efficiency. Six key pillars undergird this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nProduction, the foundation upon which the entire edifice rests, is the first step in this odyssey. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are distilled into a singular purpose. Managers must divine the desires of the customer, a task accomplished by gazing into the market's abyss, where the customer's demands are writ large. Once the market's secrets are unearthed, managers can determine what products should be forged, how many, and where they should be crafted, all in service to the customer's satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to schedule the production, a choreographed ballet of workloads and equipment maintenance, each detail vital to the grand symphony. A failure to orchestrate these elements would be akin to a cacophony, costing the company dearly in the long run. I recall my own tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, where every action, from the uniform to the reception of shipments, was choreographed with precision. A well-rehearsed plan allowed these behemoths to operate with purpose, their employees a finely tuned machine.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the strategic decisions that define a company's core competencies and outsourcing partnerships. A product's creation may involve multiple divisions, each with its own specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. The manager must discern which division is best suited for each task, or choose to outsource to other companies, leveraging the velocity of partnership to provide quality, flexibility, and reduced costs.",
            "A faded poster clung to the wall, its message scrawled in red ink like a rip in the fabric of time. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", it read, a blasphemy that hung like a specter in the stillness. Ellen Page, her face a mask of quiet desperation, stood alone on the corner, her cardboard sign a talisman against the void. Below her, the city stretched out like a barren landscape, its streets a testament to the ravages of time.\n\nBeneath the canvas of the poster, the weight of history bore down, a crushing force that had brought about the ruin of countless lives. Burma, a land of ancient rivers and forgotten cultures, had succumbed to the darkness, its people subjugated by the iron fist of the military junta. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting glimmer of hope, had been extinguished by the cold calculation of those who ruled. Monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, had been hunted and killed, their bloodstained robes a symbol of the violence that had been unleashed.\n\nThe examples of such brutality were legion, scattered across the annals of history like the carcasses of beasts slaughtered by the hand of man. The Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a deity, a being of divine right, accountable to no one. And in the United States, the leader of the free world, a man named George W. Bush, held court with the zealots of the Republic Party, their collective ignorance a palpable force that threatened to consume them all.\n\nThe memories of Tiananmen Square, of Rwanda's killing fields, of Hitler's Third Reich, lingered like a miasma, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within the hearts of men. The faces of the dead, their eyes frozen in perpetual horror, haunted the dreams of those who had survived. And yet, even in the face of such unimaginable evil, there was a glimmer of hope, a spark of resistance that refused to be extinguished.\n\nAs Ellen Page stood on the corner, her cardboard sign a beacon of defiance, the city around her seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening into abysses that yawned like the mouths of graves. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, secrets of a world gone mad, where the strong preyed upon the weak, and the powerful ruled with impunity. And yet, even in the midst of such chaos, there was a sense of calm, a stillness that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth. It was a sense that had been passed down through the ages, a knowledge that had been etched into the souls of those who had come before, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always a glimmer of light, a spark that refused to be extinguished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of jazz history, a lone figure stands as a testament to the indomitable will to create. Duke Ellington, a maestro of melody, left an indelible mark on the genre, his legacy forged in the crucible of time and tempered by his unwavering dedication to his craft. The piano, an instrument of subtle elegance, often yielded to Ellington's guiding hand, as he wove a tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. A composer of unyielding vision, Ellington crafted an architecture that allowed his soloists to improvise freely, while his tightly orchestrated pieces coalesced into a cohesive whole, a symphony of disparate parts.\n\nEllington's mastery of the individual player's timbre and their place within the ensemble enabled him to conjure pieces that transcended the boundaries of innovation, their brilliance a testament to his unwavering artistry. His approach was not unlike a conductor guiding his orchestra through a tempestuous sea, ever-vigilant and attuned to the subtlest nuances of tone and texture.\n\nIn the early days of his career, Ellington's voice became a jazz instrument, a versatile tool that added depth and color to his compositions. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues piece, exemplifies this aspect of his artistry. This haunting melody, with its call-and-response structure, reveals Ellington's ability to coax the very essence from his soloists, Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scat singing entwining in a rich and complementary tapestry. The piece unfolds like a slow-moving river, its six choruses unfolding like leaves on a branch, each one a testament to Ellington's skill in teasing out the unique qualities of his players.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a theme that resonates throughout his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines his orchestral acumen with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between Miley and Cox is a masterclass in texture and timbre, a delicate balance of voice and instrument that yields a sound both rich and cohesive. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, as Ellington deftly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, the sound a testament to the maestro's ability to coax the very essence from his players.\n\nIn the annals of jazz, Ellington's name stands as a beacon, a shining testament to the transformative power of art. His music, a reflection of his indomitable spirit, continues to captivate and inspire, a paean to the human experience in all its complexity and beauty.",
            "A hollowness gnawed within her, an ache that defied fulfillment. It had begun some four years prior, its roots taking hold like a slow-moving stain. Now, at seventeen, it remained as elusive as the first wisps of dawn breaking over the horizon. She had grown accustomed to this hollow, this gnawing sense of incompleteness, but it refused to be sated. It was as if her very essence was a vast, uncharted expanse, a desolate landscape she struggled to navigate.\n\nHer days were a series of drifting tides, each one ebbing away without a sense of purpose. She wandered, an aimless traveler, searching for a north star to guide her. Her interactions with others were fleeting, inconsequential, like the whispers of a summer breeze. She had tried to attribute her malaise to the turmoil of adolescence, but even as she entered the tempestuous waters of her late teens, the void remained, a constant, gnawing presence.\n\nAt home, a sense of tranquility reigned, a fragile balance of calm and love. Her parents were a study in serenity, their disagreements few and far between. But she was a force of nature, a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, and her parents' gentle natures often found themselves buffeted by her unbridled enthusiasm. Today, however, was a different tale. The peace was shattered, the calm shattered, by the anguish in her mother's voice.\n\nShe heard the scream, a cry that pierced the air like a shard of glass. She ran, her heart racing, her mind aflame with fear. The kitchen, once a sanctuary of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos. Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, her voice a desperate plea for help. She fell to her side, her hand reaching out to touch her mother's, to offer what comfort she could in this moment of despair.\n\n\"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with urgency.\n\nHer mother's response was a garbled mixture of pain and fear, a plea for her daughter to take her to the hospital. And so she did, carrying her mother to the car, her heart heavy with worry. The drive was a blur of fear and uncertainty, the only sound the soft hum of the engine and her mother's labored breathing.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a fortress of steel and stone, a place where the sick and the injured came to find solace. But she was not thinking of solace now. She was thinking of her mother, of the pain and the fear etched on her face. She helped her mother from the car, carried her into the hospital, and called out for help.\n\nThe doctors and nurses swarmed around, their faces a blur of concern and compassion. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter to sit in the waiting room, her heart heavy with worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a simple accident, but one that had unleashed a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty.\n\nShe sat, lost in thought, her mind a jumble of emotions. Her mother, once strong and capable, now lay in the hospital, her body broken and battered. She thought of all the times they had laughed together, the memories they had created, and the memories yet to be made. And in this moment, she knew that she would do anything to ensure her mother's well-being, to be there for her, to hold her hand and to comfort her.\n\nTime lost all meaning as she sat there, her heart heavy with worry. The only sound was the soft hum of the hospital, a reminder of the fragility of life, of the beauty and the pain that lay just beneath the surface. And in this moment, she knew that she would face whatever came next, armed with the love and the strength that had always defined her relationship with her mother.",
            "In a desolate expanse, where the ravages of time and neglect had left their indelible mark, a distinct pattern emerged. A spectacle of life, forged in the crucible of diet and habit, presented itself in a stark and unforgiving landscape. The \"Mediterranean Diet,\" a siren's call to the senses, beckoned those who sought to defy the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet, a variant of the Mediterranean's sacred lore, was characterized by an austere worship of plant-based offerings: fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, tempered by the austere beauty of monounsaturated fats, and the gentle caress of moderate alcohol intake.\n\nA prior generation of scholars had documented the inverse relationship between adherence to this diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention had shown the Mediterranean Diet to be a potent balm, soothing the tormented souls of the obese, and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the siren's call had been muted, as prior studies had not focused on the dark and foreboding shores of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nIt was in this void that a new inquiry emerged, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who had been part of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six epochs, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, a subtle and intricate dance of nutrient intake, as reflected in self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\" These women, like leaves on a windswept tree, continued their participation, a testament to their resolve, as over 95% persisted throughout the 20-year journey.\n\nThese questionnaires, like ancient artifacts, were subjected to validation studies, their worthiness to tell the tale of nutrient intake, a matter of reverence and awe. The reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, were confirmed by the hallowed records of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were relegated to the realm of the probable, a dark and foreboding category, comprising about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nLike the ebb and flow of the tides, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each food frequency questionnaire, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed, a beacon of hope in a world of despair, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious whims of random variation, and to better capture the long-term dietary tapestry, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated, a masterful weaving of scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences, a necessary act of purification, to ensure that the results were untainted by the whispers of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe instrument of analysis, Cox proportional-hazard modeling, was employed to assess the relationship between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, a delicate dance of probabilities, a separate modeling for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nIn this vast and unforgiving expanse, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was found to be associated with a lower risk of incident chronic heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of chronic heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet were found to be at a lower risk for both chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The darkness crept in with the crash of '07, a cold wind that howled through the streets of Wall Street, a calamity that shook the very foundations of a nation. The once-mighty edifice of American prosperity crumbled, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and vanquished hope. The ghosts of unemployment and despair roamed the land, their whispers echoing through the hollowed halls of a desolate economy. And yet, even now, we must confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity befall us, and how might we avoid it in the future?\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in the fertile soil of hubris and shortsightedness, when the guardians of power, blinded by ambition and avarice, pushed the banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans, a reckless gamble that would ultimately prove their undoing. The vaunted financial infrastructure, once a bastion of stability, proved woefully inadequate to the task, a crumbling dam that could not contain the deluge that was to come. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the mortgage market, were forced to play the dealer, packaging and repackaging these toxic assets, their influence spreading like a stain across the financial landscape.\n\nThe roots of this disaster stretched back to the Clinton era, when the President's lust for power and popularity led him to relax the lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of a crisis that would come to fruition seven years later. The New York Times prophetically reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The warning signs were there, yet they were ignored, and the consequences were dire.\n\nThe complexity of the mortgage market, with its adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, was a house of cards, waiting to be toppled by the slightest breeze. And topple it did, sending the economy into a tailspin from which it has yet to recover. The top five U.S. investment banks alone held a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The great crash of '07 left in its wake a trail of destruction, as Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with a $5 trillion mortgage debt, were brought under government control in September 2008.\n\nIn the aftermath of this devastation, we are left to ponder the question: how might we avoid this calamity in the future? Can we learn from the mistakes of the past and forge a new path, one that eschews the hubris and shortsightedness that led to this disaster? Or will we repeat the mistakes of our forebears, doomed to relive the same cycle of boom and bust? The darkness still looms, a specter that haunts our collective future, a reminder that the lessons of the past must be learned, lest we succumb to the same abyss that consumed us in the crash of '07.",
            "Exposition, that siren song that lures writers into the depths of tedium.  A place where the words seem to stretch out before them like a barren plain, devoid of the intricate dance of action and emotion that draws the reader in.  It is the moment when the writer's prose falters, when the story stalls, and the reader's eyes begin to glaze over in a desperate bid for escape.\n\nAnd yet, like a bad habit, it is a temptation that many of us succumb to.  The urge to tell, to explain, to inform, to dump the reader's head with a cacophony of unnecessary details.  But exposition is the enemy of the writer, a cruel mistress that promises to save us from the drudgery of crafting a compelling narrative, but delivers only a dull, leaden weight that threatens to drag our story down into the depths of obscurity.\n\nTake, for example, the oft-repeated maxim \"Show, don't tell.\"  It is a wise and ancient adage, one that has been drummed into our heads since our earliest days as writers.  But it is not a hard and fast rule, a simple checkbox to be ticked off on our list of writing dos and don'ts.  Rather, it is a nuanced art, a delicate balance between the need to inform and the need to engage.\n\nConsider the heroine of our tale, a woman whose husband meets a tragic end at the hands of a villain.  We are told of their love, their marriage, his death, but do we truly feel the weight of their bond, the depth of their sorrow?  Or do we feel only the faintest whisper of their existence, a ghostly presence that haunts the edges of our perception?  It is the writer's job to bring them to life, to breathe the spark of life into their story, to make us feel the sting of his loss.\n\nAnd how do we do this?  By showing, not telling.  By weaving the threads of their story into the fabric of the narrative, by making his love and her grief palpable, tangible, real.  We do not simply tell the reader of their experiences, we show them in all their messy, complicated glory.  We give them the gift of insight, of understanding, of connection.\n\nBut how do we avoid the pitfalls of exposition, that seductive and treacherous path that waits to snare the unwary writer?  We do it by crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and efficient.  We do it by cutting away the fat, the unnecessary words, the excess verbiage that clutters the page.  We do it by trusting our readers to infer, to fill in the gaps, to create their own narrative alongside us.\n\nAnd when we fail, when we succumb to the temptation of exposition, when we fill page after page with tedious, unnecessary detail, what's left?  A story that is as flat as a pancake, as dull as a butter knife.  A story that is doomed to fail, to wither and die on the vine of reader apathy.\n\nSo let us beware, dear writers, the siren song of exposition.  Let us shun its treacherous shores, and chart a course for the rich, fertile waters of storytelling.  Let us show, not tell, and let our readers be our guides, our confidants, our friends in the journey of creation.",
            "The static glow of the television cast a faint sheen upon the walls of the hovel. He watched as the news anchors shaped the world anew, their words a litany of violence and despair. In the dimly lit room, the flickering screen cast an eerie pallor, a haunted glow that seemed to emanate from the very core of the machine. He watched as the stories unfolded, each one a thread in the tapestry of a world gone mad.\n\nA man in Ashley, Ohio, had committed an atrocity, stabbing his wife with unyielding ferocity. The camera panned to a mugshot, the face a twisted visage of cruelty, the eyes seeming to leer from the frame. The broadcast flickered on, a meager two minutes devoted to the tale of Shad Hostettler, a name that would soon be lost in the void.\n\nThe next story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed a fleeting concern, a whisper of tragedy in a world that had grown numb. A young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, the police scrambling to unravel the threads of the crime. But the tale was quickly forgotten, lost amidst the din of other stories, other tragedies.\n\nA gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a reward offered for the capture of the perpetrator. The details were stark, the image of the bullet-riddled aircraft a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner of the world.\n\nAnd then, a fleeting mention of the rain and thunderstorms to come. A tease, a tantalizing promise of something greater to come, a brief respite from the darkness that had consumed the world.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, a hoodie-clad figure, had struck, leaving behind a trail of fear and destruction. The camera lingered on the face of the perpetrator, emboldening the emphasis on his skin tone, his height, his weight. A petty crime, and yet, it seemed, a crime worthy of special attention.\n\nAnd then, a tale of a convicted drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a man who had brought ruin and despair to the lives of countless others. His sentence, twenty-five years, a paltry number, or so it seemed, when reduced to mere months: 300. A curious choice of words, a way of softening the blow, or perhaps, a way of emphasizing the gravity of the crime.\n\nThe news anchors spoke of him as a Hispanic man, a label that seemed almost an afterthought, a gratuitous detail, a way of setting the tone for the story to come. And as he watched, the images faded, the stories blurring together like watercolors on wet paper. The world outside the television screen seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening, the silence thickening. He turned off the set, plunging the room into an oppressive stillness, the only sound the distant hum of the world outside, a world that seemed to be slowly unraveling.",
            "A bond of blood, an unyielding tie that binds brothers together - a knot of emotions tangled like the roots of an ancient tree. Pride, love, and jealousy, like serpents entwined, writhing in the dark recesses of the heart. And cruelty, a poison that seeps into the marrow, corroding the very soul. It is in times of extremity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, and the depths of their connection are laid bare. The weight of these emotions, like a burden that cannot be shaken, exacts a terrible cost. To behold one's brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss within - a chasm of darkness and light, of good and evil. It is in the aftermath of their actions, in the echoes of their deeds, that the true character of a brother is revealed.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a perilous journey, their bond forged in the crucible of adversity. The verdant world around them, once a tapestry of hope and promise, is reduced to a barren and unforgiving expanse. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The narrator's voice, a mournful whisper that echoes through the narrative, bears witness to the turmoil that rages within the protagonist's heart.\n\nThe protagonist's actions, a tangled web of pride and resentment, are a testament to the complexities of their bond. From the outset, he had envisioned a brother who would be his equal, his partner in adventure and exploration. But the reality of Doodle's fragile existence, a fragile flame flickering in the darkness, shatters his illusions. The protagonist's rage and frustration boil over, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to consume him whole. And yet, it is in the depths of this turmoil that a glimmer of love and compassion flickers, a beacon of hope that illuminates the darkness.\n\nThe protagonist's heart, a battleground of conflicting emotions, is a battleground where love and cruelty, hope and despair, engage in an eternal struggle. His feelings for Doodle, a labyrinth of contradictions, are a microcosm of the human condition - a complex and multifaceted tapestry woven from the threads of love, pride, and jealousy. In the end, it is not the physical world that is defeated, but the protagonist's own demons, their bond with Doodle a testament to the redemptive power of love and compassion.",
            "The brain, a labyrinthine repository of information, a maelstrom of electrochemical signals, a system that defies comprehension. As the world outside has crumbled, so too has our understanding of its intricate workings. We once likened it to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a contraption of ones and zeros, a mockery of its true nature. Yet, as we delve deeper into its mysteries, we find that these metaphors falter, leading us down a path of misconception.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the senses, those windows to the world that translate the raw data of light, sound, touch, and heat into a language the brain can understand. The signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, dance through the neural networks, transformed by the brain's algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. We see a box on a white background, and the brain, like a patient craftsman, assembles the disparate threads of color, orientation, and border into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, like a skilled navigator, charts the course, speeding the recognition of the box, guiding our perception. Yet, even as we acknowledge its presence, our attention filter, a gatekeeper of sorts, decides what is worthy of notice, filtering out the irrelevant, the superfluous.\n\nAs information is processed, it is modulated by attention, a selective gaze that determines its significance and the cognitive processes it shall be made available to. We see every blade of grass, but our attention, a razor-sharp blade, cuts through the noise, allowing us to focus on the essential. And when our name is spoken in a cacophony of sound, our attention, like a homing pigeon, homing in on the signal, makes it audible above the din.\n\nMemory, a labyrinthine repository of knowledge, is forged through encoding, a process as mysterious as the whisper of the wind. There are types of encoding, each specific to the sensory stimuli that birthed it. Verbal input, like a hieroglyphic script, can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on the nature of the input. And once stored, information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical signals that course through the neural networks, a flickering candle in the darkness.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a puzzle, a tapestry woven from disparate threads. Some propose that it is a semantic network, a web of nodes representing concepts, linked by their relatedness. In this vast, labyrinthine structure, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But the brain, a mystery, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, remains an enigma, its secrets locked within its labyrinthine recesses, waiting to be unlocked by the curious and the brave.",
            "The specter of technology and the monolithic structure of capitalism looms over the horizon, a dystopian landscape foretold by Aldous Huxley's prescient novel, Brave New World. A world where the ethos of community supplants individuality, where the masses are conditioned to chase ephemeral happiness above all else. The denizens of this nightmarish realm are pawns in a grand game, their existence predetermined by the World Controller's all-encompassing ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theism, we glimpse Huxley's disquieting suspicions regarding the burgeoning systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxist thought – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the emerging economy.\n\nIn this Brave New World, capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark regarding the true nature of their relationships with other classes, ensnared in a web of ideological control that prioritizes their own self-interest above all else. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by hypnopædia, instills an insatiable drive to consume, spend, and indulge, a siren's call manipulated by the World Controller. The lower classes, relegated to the Delta, Gamma, and other such designations, are mere puppets, their wills subjugated to the whims of the dominant ideology. They are complicit in their own oppression, buying into a system that perpetuates the status quo.\n\nHegemony, the idea that one group holds sway over others, is starkly evident in this dystopian society. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, do little to challenge the system, content to accept their station in life. The interactions between individuals, or rather the lack thereof, serve as a potent indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. Relationships are superficial, lacking depth or substance, as exemplified by the shallow comments of the male characters regarding women's physical appearance and the women's unapologetic descriptions of their experiences. The societal classes' complacency with their position in the hierarchy is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to obey and conform, convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.\n\nIn this bleak world, love and genuine emotions are anathema, replaced by a stultifying superficiality. The characters' interactions are a far cry from the rich tapestry of human experience, reduced to shallow transactions and fleeting encounters. Huxley's Brave New World serves as a warning, a dire prophecy of a future where technology and capitalism converge to deprive humanity of its free will and emotional expression. The novel's bleak vision serves as a clarion call, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the dehumanizing effects of a system that values consumption over connection.",
            "Four years spent within these walls, a fractured landscape of stone and steel. It is a place where feet move with purpose, where paths converge and diverge like the arteries of a great, sprawling beast. And yet, in this labyrinthine sprawl, the journey from one point to another can be a Sisyphean task. I have known this struggle, traversing the distance from East Halls to Willard building, a trek that once took up to a quarter hour on foot, and longer still in the rain. The elements, a capricious mistress, can turn even the shortest path into an odyssey.\n\nI recall a conversation with an alumnus, a man not much older than myself, who spoke of the campus as it once was – a place where the East Halls stood apart, shrouded in a sea of vacant land. But time, that great clarifier, has seen the transformation of this desolate expanse into a tapestry of sports fields, modern edifices, and apartments. As the campus continues to expand, so too does the difficulty of navigating its twists and turns. In this regard, the bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a mode of transportation both efficient and elegant. Yet, it is not merely a matter of possessing a bike; it is a question of cultivating a culture that values the pedestrian and the cyclist.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after a long hiatus, and his words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The bicycle is not merely a mode of transportation; it is a way of life, a means of connecting with the world around us. And, like many of my peers, I have come to realize that it is the key to unlocking the secrets of this campus. From my home off-campus, a place not dissimilar from some of the dorms, I could walk to Thomas building in a quarter hour or more. But with a bike, the journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a fraction of the time I would spend on foot. The road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is a challenge, a serpentine path that winds through the heart of the campus. It is a route that requires patience, a path that tests one's resolve.\n\nAnd yet, I would not trade it for the world. For in the rhythm of the pedals, I find a sense of freedom, a sense of purpose. The bicycle is not merely a tool; it is an extension of the self, a means of navigating the complexities of this campus. It is a reminder that even in the most seemingly insurmountable challenges, there is always a way forward, always a path that winds its way through the darkness. And so, I will continue to ride, to pedal through the twists and turns of this campus, ever seeking the beauty that lies just beyond the horizon."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate expanse of human suffering, I am drawn to the pursuit of an education in social work, a vocation that beckons me to navigate the labyrinthine paths of the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounded and the forsaken reside. It is here, amidst the bleak landscapes of abuse and neglect, that I aspire to offer solace and support to the innocent, to be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. \n\nIn this dismal tapestry, I bring with me the threads of service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships and the sharpening of my own professional edge. These values, forged in the crucible of my own experiences and convictions, are not mere platitudes, but a testament to the fire that burns within me, a flame that illuminates the darkness and guides me towards a life of purpose.\n\nMy journey towards this vocation has been a winding one, beset on all sides by the ghosts of uncertainty and doubt. For years, I wandered, lost in the wilderness of my own aspirations, uncertain of the path that lay before me. It was not until I chanced upon a friend, her home a sanctuary from the tempests of the world, that I encountered a young soul, torn asunder by the tumult of his own family's dysfunction. And it was in that moment, as I beheld the anguish etched upon his face, that I knew my calling, my raison d'être.\n\nThe events that transpired subsequent to that fateful encounter only served to solidify my resolve. The parents, a pair of towering phantoms, their faces shrouded in deceit and malice, seemed to recoil from the very notion of accountability, their words a tangled web of excuses and half-truths. And it was then, in the depths of that darkness, that I knew I had to act, to intervene, to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nIn the years that followed, I continued to navigate the treacherous waters of social injustice, a rebel, a dissident, a force to be reckoned with. I defied the conventions of a society that values conformity above all else, that seeks to stifle individuality and uniqueness. I wore my heart on my sleeve, my colors bold and unapologetic, my voice a clarion call to action.\n\nAnd it is this same spirit, this same fire that burns within me, that drives me to pursue a career in social work, to challenge the status quo, to be a champion of social justice. For I know that the individual, that fragile, flickering flame of humanity, is the very essence of our existence, and that it is our duty, our sacred obligation, to protect, to nurture, and to preserve it.",
            "The desolate landscape of slumber stretched before us, a vast and unfilled expanse of darkness. It was a terrain scarred by the scourge of insomnia, a disorder that left its victims stranded, lost and unmoored in a world of perpetual wakefulness. The biological model, with its cold and unforgiving logic, reduced this affliction to its constituent parts: genes and heritable factors, the physiologic underpinnings of a slumber that refused to come. Like a barren and unforgiving land, the hypothalamus, that most ancient and mysterious of organs, held sway over the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. And within its depths, the neurons, like sentinels of the night, guarded the gates of Morpheus, their delicate balance tipping the scales between repose and unrest.\n\nThe study of mice, those tiny, inscrutable creatures, had revealed a hidden order, a phenomenology of slumber and wakefulness that was both wondrous and terrible. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like unseen hands, reached out to grasp the threads of sleep, to weave a tapestry of rest and rejuvenation. And when these receptors faltered, or failed, the very fabric of existence was rent asunder, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered lives and broken dreams.\n\nThe sociocultural models, with their plaintive cry of environmental determinism, beckoned us to consider the world beyond the narrow confines of the individual. Like a vast and mysterious sea, the collective experience of humanity stretched out before us, a maelstrom of influences that shaped and molded the human spirit. The inherited phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, whispered secrets to us of a past long forgotten, a past that shaped the contours of our present. And the sociocultural models, like wise and ancient sages, counseled us to heed this whisper, to listen to the hidden rhythms of the human heart.\n\nIn the dark and dusty recesses of the human experience, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that twists and turns like a serpent through the underbrush of our collective unconscious. It is a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within. Primary insomnia, a difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, a waking nightmare that haunted the somnambulant hours; primary hypersomnia, a waking world that threatened to consume us whole; narcolepsy, a catatonia of the will, a surrender to the void; breathing-related sleep disorder, a gasping for air in a world that seemed to suffocate us; circadian rhythm sleep disorder, a disordered clockwork, a world gone mad.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this chaos, there is a glimmer of hope, a light that flickers like a candle in the wind. For in the study of these disorders, we find a glimmer of understanding, a hint of a language that speaks to the very heart of our humanity. The GABAB receptor, that mysterious and elusive entity, held the key to this understanding, a key that unlocked the doors of perception, revealing the hidden workings of the human brain.\n\nBut what of the sociocultural implications of this study? What of the world beyond the laboratory, the world that lay shrouded in the mists of uncertainty? The answer, like a ghostly presence, haunted the edges of our perception, a presence that whispered secrets to us of a world in which the biological and sociocultural models intertwined like the threads of a tapestry. A world in which the phenotype, that ancient and unfathomable legacy, shaped the contours of our present, a world in which the very fabric of existence was woven from the threads of our collective experience.\n\nAnd so, we return to the starting point, to the desolate landscape of slumber, to the biological and sociocultural models that stretch out before us like a vast and unforgiving expanse. It is a terrain that is both familiar and strange, a world that is at once both our own and yet utterly alien. And in this world, we find the roots of insomnia, a disorder that defies easy categorization, a hydra-headed monster that assails us from without and within. But it is also a world of hope, a world in which the biological and sociocultural models intertwine like the threads of a tapestry, a world in which the very fabric of existence is woven from the threads of our collective experience.",
            "The desolate vastness of the human experience stretches out before us like an uncharted terrain. In this unforgiving landscape, some souls stumble upon the jagged edges of a hidden disorder: Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a condition where the very fabric of perception is rent asunder, leaving the sufferer lost in a world of discordant sounds and muffled whispers. Like a traveler in a barren wilderness, one must navigate the uncharted territories of diagnosis and understanding.\n\nThe earliest whispers of CAPD's presence can be heard in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers first began to study the mysterious affliction. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari were among the first to chart this unexplored terrain, developing tests to unravel the tangled threads of the disorder. Like a pair of pioneers, they ventured into the unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the human mind.\n\nBut CAPD's manifestations are as varied as the desert sands that shift and swirl in the wind. Some are unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, like a traveler lost in a maze of echoing canyons. Others struggle to distinguish between two or more competing sounds, their ears muffled by the din of the world. Still, others are crippled by the inability to recognize patterns, like a poet struggling to find the rhythm in a sea of discordant notes.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and uncharted territory. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the treacherous landscape of auditory function, using a variety of measures to evaluate the patient's skills. Like a mapmaker charting the unknown, they rely on systematic observation and performance tests to guide them through the unexplored regions of the mind.\n\nThere is no single tool or test that holds the key to unlocking the secrets of CAPD, no compass to guide the traveler through the wilderness of the human experience. Instead, a patchwork of assessments and evaluations must be woven together to form a fragile tapestry of understanding. The patient is presented with a series of auditory stimuli, a cacophony of sounds that must be unraveled like a knot in a rope.\n\nAnd yet, even in the face of this uncertainty, there are those who seek to help. Teachers in mainstreamed classrooms, like beacons in the darkness, can offer a lifeline to students struggling to navigate the turbulent waters of CAPD. With patience, understanding, and a willingness to learn, they can help their students find a path through the wilderness of sound, a path that may be as fragile as a reed in the wind, but one that holds the promise of a brighter future.\n\nAs we venture into the unknown, we must remember that CAPD is a disorder of perception, a condition that affects not just the ears, but the very fabric of our understanding. Like a traveler in a strange land, we must be willing to listen, to seek out the whispers of understanding, and to follow the faint trail of clues that lead us deeper into the mystery of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the tools or the tests that hold the key to understanding CAPD, but the willingness to listen, to seek out the hidden patterns, and to chart a course through the uncharted territories of the human mind.",
            "In the masquerade of Twelfth Night, the duplicity of disguise seems a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows for the perpetuation of deception, a shield to deflect the cruel hand of fate. Yet, it is a fragile bulwark, one that must eventually be shed lest the soul be lost to the void. The problem lies not in the shedding of the disguise, but in the cost of stripping away the veil: the risk of alienation, of severing ties with those who have come to know us in our falsehood.\n\nThe subject of deception, particularly in the realm of gender role reversal, raises complications of its own. It is a tangled web, with each strand a knotted consideration. Why do we don the guise of another? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as in Viola's case, where the misty veil of the unknown demands a transformation to safeguard her very existence? As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in doing so, she cuts herself off from the support of her own sex, a severance that would test the mettle of even the strongest heart.\n\nIn the cold light of Illyria, Viola's ruse is so convincing that it breeds confusion, her identity subsumed by the newcomer Sebastian. Olivia's affections are torn asunder, like a thread pulled from its weft, as she falls prey to the mistaken ardor, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, the nascent feelings between Viola and Orsino remain unspoken, a subterranean current that threatens to burst forth in the unlikeliest of moments, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nYet, it is in the guise of Cesario that Twelfth Night reveals the latent desires of its characters, a subtext that whispers of unrequited love and hidden longings. Olivia's switch of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her gentle regard for Viola as sibling, seems a jest, a send-up of the societal norms of the time. It is a jest that belies a deeper truth: that our desires are as multifaceted as the masks we wear.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a question: what lies beyond the veil of deception, the hidden self that we dare not confront? Is it a truth that sets us free, or a prison from which we cannot escape? The play holds its answer close, a secret known only to the playwright's pen.",
            "The shadows of colonialism lay heavy over the vast expanse of German rule, its brutal visage most starkly evident in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, this bleak portrayal cannot encompass the full scope of a colonial empire as multifaceted as the German. Educational provision, like the empire itself, was a tapestry woven from diverse threads, each one distinct in its fabric and hue. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational efforts were lauded by contemporary scholars.\n\nMeanwhile, in South West Africa, a stark contrast unfolded. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of the native population, the task of educating the Ovaherero and Nama was left largely to the mission societies, their efforts woefully underpinned by the colonial authorities. The government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and bolstering the missionary schools with patronage and regulation. These policies bore lasting consequences for South West Africa, even after the dissolution of German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where the African population had made significant strides in literacy and education, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The confluence of various social, political, and economic factors gave rise to this divergent experience, and this paper seeks to shed light on these underlying forces, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nA vast literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, most of which is rooted in German and dates back to the era of German colonial rule. These early works focused primarily on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the striking differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A seminal work in this regard is Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of the two colonies, underscoring the factors that contributed to their divergence. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nGeography played a crucial role in shaping the German colonial experience, particularly in South West Africa. The colony's moderately temperate climate belied its arid desert expanses, which covered a substantial portion of the territory. The European population of South West Africa, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, was a direct reflection of the region's relatively hospitable conditions. In stark contrast, East Africa, with its next largest settler population, harbored only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The darkness that defined it, like a shadow cast across the land, stretched out before them like a canvas of endless possibility. Over the past century, the classifications of popular music had grown like a twisted, gnarled tree, its branches heavy with the weight of countless sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. And at its dark, twisted heart lay the behemoth of Heavy Metal, a creature that had burst forth like a screaming, fiery apparition from the very depths of the earth.\n\nIt was a music of excess, of more – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. A sound that shook the very foundations of the soul, like the rumbling of thunder on a summer's day. And yet, it was also a music of precision, of chops, of musicians who wielded their instruments like masters of a dark, ancient art. The influence of psychedelic drugs, like a whispered incantation, had seeped into the marrow of the genre, imbuing it with a sense of the surreal and the otherworldly.\n\nThe darkness that lurked within was a siren's call, drawing in the lost and the disillusioned like moths to a flame. It was a music of the damned, of the outcasts and the outlaws, of those who dwelled in the shadows and danced with the darkness. And yet, it was also a music of the sublime, of the Romantic Era's dark, visceral qualities, which had been coaxed forth like a ghost from the very depths of the human experience.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, like a bleak, neon-lit neon sign, screamed out into the void, a testament to the darkness that lay at the heart of the movement. It was a cry of rebellion, a challenge to the status quo, a declaration that the Beatles, like a phoenix from the ashes, could rise up and be as heavy, as dark, as the Rolling Stones. And so, the White Album was born, a twisted, mutated creature, a marriage of the dark and the light, of the beautiful and the grotesque.\n\nAs the years went by, the genre continued to twist and turn, like a living, breathing thing, spawning sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like a hydra's head, each one more monstrous, more beautiful, more alive than the last. And at its heart, like a dark, pulsing core, lay the Heavy Metal movement, a behemoth that would not be silenced, would not be tamed, a music that would rage on, like a wildfire, until the very end of time itself.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists unleashed their dreamlike visions upon the world, Henri Rousseau was quietly toiling away, his brushstrokes imbuing his canvases with the essence of his own nocturnal wanderings. The Dream, a painting from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's own inner struggle - a struggle to reconcile the desire for recognition with the need for creative freedom. Like a traveler who ventures into the unknown, Rousseau found himself beset by the same fear of being lost and the same yearning for guidance.\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's biography, a narrative woven from the threads of his own making. Born in the town of Laval in northwest France on a spring morning in 1844, Rousseau was the scion of a family that enjoyed a comfortable, if not extravagant, existence. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, he was denied the formal education that would have provided a clear path forward. Instead, he toiled in obscurity, working as a gabelou for the municipal toll service until the age of forty, his existence a shadowy presence among the bustle of everyday life.\n\nIt was only after the cruel hand of fate dealt him a devastating blow - the loss of his wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children - that Rousseau turned to painting as a means of escape, a way to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Unencumbered by the conventions of his time, he poured his heart and soul into his art, creating works that were raw, unbridled, and unapologetic. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau remained true to his own voice, a voice that spoke of the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world was a Sisyphean task, a task that seemed to weigh heavily upon his shoulders. For, despite his dedication to his craft, he was a latecomer to the world of art, and the likes of Matisse were already making a name for themselves. Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, notes the stark contrast between the two artists - Matisse, driven by a desire to avoid the mundane, and Rousseau, driven by a desire to be accepted by the very establishment he longed to upend. \"Matisse was a painter who recoiled at the thought of painting in a trite way,\" Gordon writes, \"while Rousseau's ambition was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be welcomed into the fold of the Artiste Français.\"\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau's inner turmoil is laid bare, a canvas of contradictions where the desire for recognition and creative freedom wrestle for dominance. It is a painting that speaks to the artist's own personal struggle, a struggle that would continue to haunt him until the end of his days.",
            "In the desolate landscape of existence, some have posited a kinship between the labyrinthine realms of ethics and aesthetics. The affinity between truth and beauty, like the unyielding grip of a winter's night, has beckoned scholars and thinkers for centuries. As John Keats so poignantly etched in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The ephemeral nature of our understanding, gleaned from the crucible of education or experience, bespeaks a deeper, almost primal connection between the ostensibly disparate realms of morality and art.\n\nWe find ourselves drawn to the mysteries of ethics and aesthetics, like moths to the flickering flame of a spent candle, without the need for explicit instruction. These twin pursuits are, in essence, attempts to grasp the ungraspable, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral, rather than to lay down a set of proscriptions or prescriptions. Our analyses of art and morality, though they may delve into the minutiae of style, form, and context, ultimately fall short of capturing the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that sets a masterpiece apart.\n\nConsider the iconic Mona Lisa, for instance. Our discussions of her enigmatic smile may revolve around notions of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these explanations only gesture toward the truth, rather than revealing it. When asked to defend our favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to the enigmatic phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" as if to acknowledge the existence of a transcendent quality that defies capture.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's astute observation, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate,\" speaks to the intransigent nature of art and morality. Regardless of how extensively we catalog the properties of a work of literature, there remains an unbridgeable chasm between our descriptions and the work itself. Ethics, too, inhabits this realm of the unutterable.\n\nAs Wittgenstein so eloquently phrased it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendence, this unspoken essence, that constitutes the most potent bond between ethics and aesthetics. This synergy is especially pronounced in the realm of literature, where the nexus of art and morality is inextricably entwined. As McKean astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"\n\nLiving, in all its messy, beautiful complexity, is inextricably bound up with values. Literature, that most human of arts, speaks directly to this fundamental aspect of our existence. It is through literature that we find a reflection of our own humanity, with all its attendant virtues and frailties. As we navigate the desolate landscape of existence, it is literature that provides a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is beauty to be found, and truth to be grasped, however fleetingly.",
            "In the shadow of the alps, where the mountains touch the sky, lies a land forged from the fires of disparate cultures. Germany, a nation born of the confluence of ancient tribes and the whispers of a storied past. From the distant echoes of the Baltic Sea's lapping waves to the majesty of the Elbe's gentle flow, the essence of Germany's being seeps from the very marrow of its stones. In the cities of München and Kiel, in Köln's riverine heart and Dresden's Saxon soul, the cultural currents swirl and eddy, a testament to the land's polyphonic heritage.\n\nThe name Germania, a byword for the ancestral home of the Germans, is a mystery shrouded in the mists of time. Scholars and historians debate the etymology of this moniker, some tracing its roots to the Tungrian tribe, others to the spear-like \"ger\" wielded by these ancient warriors. Perhaps, as the Gauls themselves may have whispered to Julius Caesar, it was a term born of their own tongue, a neighborly nod to the fierce and unyielding people beyond the Rhine.\n\nIn the annals of history, the Roman writer Tacitus penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, extolling their unyielding ferocity and aboriginal roots. \"I regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races,\" he wrote, as if to underscore the singularity of their bloodline. But what of those who would seek to leave the warmth of Italy for the unforgiving lands of Germania? Who would brave the tempests and the wilds for a distant, windswept home? Certainly not the Romans, who would send their legions to plunder the riches of Germania, but rarely, if ever, settle among its people.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes coalesced in the first century, they dwelled on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and their skills, yet refusing to be subsumed by the imperial giant. And so, Germany's story unfolded, a tapestry woven from the disparate threads of history, culture, and the indomitable will of its people.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind vacant, a canvas unblemished by the turmoil that churned within. The scene before me unfolded like a desolate landscape, devoid of meaning or significance. My thoughts drifted, ephemeral whispers that vanished as swiftly as they appeared, leaving naught but the stark, unadorned reality. My consciousness flowed like a dark, uncharted river, unmoored from the anchors of emotion or attachment.\n\nIn a bygone era, I had sought to harness the mysteries of creation, to capture the essence of the world on paper. I had pored over the words of an artist, a sage who had counseled me to grasp the fundamentals of art. He spoke of a world beyond the mundane, a realm where the boundaries of reality were stretched and reshaped. His teachings had led me to The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome that promised to unleash my inner artist. I had devoured its pages, drunk in the secrets of perception and interpretation.\n\nA technique had caught my eye, a simple yet profound exercise: the rectangle of observation. By enclosing a scene within a square frame, one could tame the chaos, reduce the complexities to a manageable whole. I had attempted to apply this lesson to the still life before me, but my mind had faltered, overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of details. The bowl, the fruit, the table, the kitchen, the dining room - all these elements swirled together in a maelstrom of sensory input, leaving me reeling.\n\nYet, even as I stood there, transfixed by the sight, a spark within me ignited. The flame of artistic expression flickered to life, casting a warm, golden glow over the scene. I saw it: Work in Brown, a masterpiece unfolding before my very eyes. My fingers trembled with anticipation as I reached for the pencil, my hand hovering above the page like a bird poised on the branch of a winter tree.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. The respite was shattered by the urgent call of nature. I turned away from the canvas, my hand clenching into a fist as I grasped the handle of the toilet. The offending mass of brown, a detritus of civilization, refused to yield to my will. I flushed, and flushed again, but still it remained, a stubborn, unyielding presence. My hand, now a living thing, jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the recalcitrant mass.\n\nAs I stood there, my knuckles white with frustration, my mind slipped back into its default mode, a state of numbness and detachment. I gazed at the offending package, a bundle of filth and waste, and felt nothing. My gaze drifted to the wall, my hand reaching out to grasp the roll of toilet paper, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos. I clenched my hand into a fist once more, then, with a slow, deliberate movement, dipped it into the bowl, as if surrendering to the void.",
            "In the bleak expanse of American roads, a deadly vector cuts through the youth of the nation. Teenagers, with the fragile weight of inexperience, surrender to the hazards of driving. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth: the teen brain, still in its formative stages, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Simple inexperience, a wanton disregard for the unforgiving laws of physics, and an innate propensity for risk-taking propel the youngest drivers toward calamity.\n\nA study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, like a cold wind through a desolate landscape, reveals a stark correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents occur. The statistics are a stark testament to the treacherous terrain of adolescence, where the siren's call of peer pressure lures the unwary into the jaws of danger.\n\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to stem the tide of carnage with provisional driver's licenses, a stopgap measure that restricts the hours of driving and prohibits minors from riding shotgun. Yet, as a seasoned observer, it is clear that these measures are but a feeble bulwark against the deluge of death that threatens to engulf the youngest drivers.\n\nA more profound understanding, one that acknowledges the inherent limitations of the adolescent mind, is needed. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even the threshold of 19 or 20 is too early for the unencumbered freedom of a regular driver's license. The allure of risk, a siren's call that beckons to the young, must be tempered by the wisdom of experience.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the death toll will continue to rise, a macabre tally that will only deepen with the advent of a new generation of drivers. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's offspring will flood the roads, a tidal wave of inexperience and hubris that will shatter the fragile safety net of existing regulations.\n\nA legislative solution, straightforward and unencumbered by the complexities of bureaucratic red tape, is at hand. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes, laying the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, issued prior to the granting of a full license, can still serve as a stepping stone, accompanied by a requisite number of practical driver's training hours. The specific number of hours, a figure that can be drawn from the experience of existing states (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult), will serve as a benchmark for a generation.\n\nUniform, national legislation on this issue is a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding the nation's youth. This is not a novel idea, but a necessary step in the face of an unfolding catastrophe. The lives of countless teenagers hang in the balance, like autumn leaves on a gusty day. We must not falter in our duty to protect them.",
            "In the dusty stacks of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, I chanced upon a collection of trick films, their numbers dwindling to fifteen from the fleeting years of 1895 to 1901. These short-lived spectacles, born of creative manipulation, relied on the art of editing to weave illusions. My pursuit led me to delve into the poetic underpinnings of the majority of these trick films, as well as the aberrant characteristics that emerged in a few of the later productions. It became apparent that the trick films of the era adhered to a set of strict parameters, their composition relegated to a static frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, reliant upon long and medium shots, and bound by the unyielding rule of one shot equaling one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few of these early films dared to challenge these conventions, introducing novelties such as multiple shots. However, an examination of the trick films as a whole reveals a common thread - their reliance on interior settings, framed by the imposing proscenium arch of the theatre. The camera, unmoving and unyielding, captured the action within this artificial realm, its perspective rooted in the traditions of theatre and vaudeville, where the magic of illusion reigned supreme.\n\nA fundamental limitation of this approach was the restriction it placed on the movement of figures within the frame. They could only traverse the horizontal axis, their trajectory confined to a linear path, never venturing towards or away from the camera. A case in point is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors appear from the right side, their movements confined to a narrow, horizontal plane. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoving and unyielding.\n\nThe static composition of the frontal proscenium also dictated that shots be predominantly long, with medium shots appearing only sporadically. Close-ups, a staple of later cinematic storytelling, were an anomaly in these early trick films, their absence a reflection of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the entire performance was presented within the frame of the stage. Actors remained fixed in the middle ground, their movements never drawing them towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating a single film, a constraint that limited their length to a mere minute or less, depending on the frame rate employed. This restriction stifled the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which predominantly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching illusions, bereft of a coherent story. However, a closer examination of these trick films reveals that a single \"shot\" may actually comprise multiple physical shots, expertly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take, for instance, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that, upon closer inspection, reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a long-forgotten past, a figure emerged, his name etched in the annals of history - John Taylor of Caroline. A stalwart advocate for the Republican creed, his fervor burned with an unyielding passion for the principles of personal freedom and limited governance. Though his roots lay in the fertile soil of agriculture, his forays into politics sowed the seeds of a man unyielding in his convictions. His dedication to the agrarian way of life was the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were forged.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the chains of native tradition, Taylor believed the United States held the promise of crafting an ideal system, one where self-government could flourish unencumbered. He espoused the natural rights of man, arguing that they were inextricably linked, that the denial of one right would imperil the others, rendering them worthless. These rights, he contended, must remain beyond the grasp of the government, untainted by the rot of despotism.\n\nTaylor's worldview was predicated on a dualistic morality, a stark dichotomy between good and evil. He believed that government, as exercised by man, was susceptible to both virtues and vices. In his estimation, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, nurtured agriculture, and checked the rapacious tendencies of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles would, he argued, function equitably, untainted by the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he averred, was an inescapable fact of human nature, but one that became pernicious only when it gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the weak.\n\nTo prevent the ascendancy of bad principles, Taylor advocated for a government of strict construction, one that operated within the narrow confines of the Constitution's explicit provisions. He shuddered at the prospect of an expansive Federal government, its power and rights unchecked, a potential harbinger of despotism. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, recognizing that such an approach could lead to corruption. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words a testament to the nation's nature as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "A precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project brought a fleeting sense of unease. The causes behind this decline remained shrouded in mystery, a void to be filled by conjecture and speculation. The creeping onset of winter, with its wintry grasp on the New England campus, may have contributed to a decline in commutes by bicycle or foot. The hectic end to the fall semester, when students were consumed by the final throes of schoolwork and the inevitable processing of grades, may have also played a part. The holidays, a month-long respite from the demands of academia, further siphoned off interest, leaving the commuter log to gather dust on a forgotten shelf.\n\nA growing awareness of the cyclical nature of project momentum crept into our thoughts - a burst of energy at the outset, followed by a natural decline. We endeavored to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a concentrated effort to revive the initiative in March. Though it yielded a temporary increase in log submissions, it begged the question: how to sustain momentum in the face of inherent fluctuations. The problem of holiday and semester breaks, a recurring affliction for higher education, presented a particular challenge.\n\nA more insidious foe, however, lay at the heart of our struggles: the deeply ingrained notion that personal freedom, independence, and flexibility are inextricably linked to the freedom to drive. A cultural paradigm, stubborn and resistant to change. We attempted to counter this with incentives - gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. Yet, a nagging doubt persisted: could we have done more to combat the decline? Would larger, more substantial prizes - a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car - have been the catalyst for increased participation? The allure of these prizes, announced in December and January, may have been enough to rekindle interest and spark renewed engagement.\n\nThe prizes, however, remained static throughout the project. A gentle wind, blowing softly at the outset, gradually lost its force, failing to sustain the momentum we had worked so hard to build. If only we had announced a series of escalating incentives, each one more tantalizing than the last, perhaps our efforts would have borne fruit. Alas, the gift cards, once sufficient, gradually lost their luster, unable to stem the tide of waning interest.",
            "In a world where the markets roamed like a barren wasteland, a creature emerged - the ETF, a security born of human ingenuity, designed to track the indices, commodities, or baskets of assets like a beast tracking its prey. It was a creature of flexibility, trading like a stock on an exchange, yet offering the diversification of an index fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership. The ETF's allure was palpable, a siren's call to the savviest of investors, promising the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.\n\nYet, like the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world, there existed a darker side to the ETF, a reminder that even in a world of abundance, there were costs to be paid. The expense ratios, a barren wasteland of fees, stood as a testament to the ETF's true nature. And so, the investor must navigate this landscape, weighing the benefits of diversification against the costs of commissions, a constant reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can turn out to be a pitfall.\n\nThe ETF IHF, a particular specimen of this breed, held within it a secret: its top 10 holdings, a diverse assemblage of assets that comprised 63.58% of its assets. Like a treasure trove hidden deep within the ruins of a forgotten city, these holdings held the key to understanding the ETF's true nature. By examining the top 10 holdings, one could gain insight into the ETF's very essence, and perhaps, uncover a hidden truth - that the benefits of owning a single ETF might not be as great as they seemed.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of the ETF IHF, one must first evaluate its holdings, a task akin to navigating a treacherous landscape. By using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, one could estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations, a complex dance of numbers, revealed a startling truth: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings could provide a 6.11% higher return, a 16% increase in returns, compared to the ETF as a whole.\n\nBut like the fragile balance of the post-apocalyptic world, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was 0.12 lower than the ETF's, a delicate balance that could be easily upset. The question remained: were these portfolios statistically different? To answer this, one must delve into the realm of standard deviation, a measure of the variability of returns. By determining the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalizing it to 100%, one could compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.\n\nAs the sun set on this desolate landscape, the investor was left with a choice: to venture forth into the unknown, or to retreat to the safety of the familiar. The ETF IHF, like the post-apocalyptic world, was a place of wonder and terror, where the benefits of diversification and flexibility beckoned, but the costs of commissions and fees lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike. Only time would tell if the ETF IHF would prove to be a savior or a curse, a creature of the market that would lead the investor to prosperity or destruction.",
            "In the depths of his fevered imagination, a realm of shadows beckoned, one that Edgar Allan Poe had all but claimed as his own, a place he called Dream-Land. It was a world born of his darker musings, a twisted tapestry woven from the threads of his own tortured soul. And in this desolate landscape, a word echoed, a word that would serve as a harbinger of his descent into the abyss: Thulé.\n\nPoe's fascination with this term was not born of the void, but rather from the influence of a master wordsmith, the German bard Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe's own works, particularly the poetic drama Faust, had left an indelible mark on Poe's psyche. It was in Faust's second part, a somber and mournful tale, that Poe would find the germ of his own creative seed. A poem, \"The King of Thulé\", told the tragic tale of a king who, bereft of his beloved wife, succumbed to the darkness, his spirit shattered by the memories of his lost love.\n\nIn this twisted doppelganger of his own loss, Poe would find a kinship, a reflection of his own mortal coil. The King of Thulé's descent into madness, his drinking and despair, mirrored Poe's own struggles with the demon of addiction. And it was in this same work that Poe would find the term Thulé, a word that would become the leitmotif of his own dark musings.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" was no mere happenstance. It was a deliberate nod to Goethe, a acknowledgement of the debt he owed to the German master. And in \"Dream-Land\", the landscape of Thulé was a twisted reflection of the King's own desolate realm, a world devoid of color, haunted by the specters of the dead.\n\nIt was a testament to Poe's reverence for Goethe that he would draw inspiration from the German's works, weaving them into the very fabric of his own creative tapestry. Poe's admiration for the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was well-documented, but it was Goethe who had left an indelible mark on his psyche. The echoes of Thulé, a word born of Goethe's imagination, would haunt Poe's own, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within, waiting to consume him whole.\n\nIn the end, it was not the void that had spawned Dream-Land, but the creative ferment of Goethe's genius, a wellspring of inspiration that would fuel Poe's own descent into the abyss. And in the shadows of Thulé, Poe would find a reflection of his own mortality, a grim reminder that the darkness was always present, waiting to claim him whole.",
            "In the shadow of California's statutes, a question lingers: can a customer, injured by the negligence of a grocery store, claim punitive damages against the store's manager, who, informed of a spill, chose not to act, distracted as he was by the mundane act of eating dinner? The judge, a sentinel of justice, is unlikely to dismiss the claim summarily. To grant punitive damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable, an affront to the very notion of decency.\n\nJennifer Palmer's claim, though precarious, is not without merit. She can argue that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of neglecting to clean the spill, given the history of similar incidents at the store. Six slip-and-fall accidents had occurred in the preceding year, and still Martin failed to take action to safeguard his customers. This is not the act of a manager concerned with the well-being of those who enter his store. It is, rather, a callous disregard for the safety of others, a dereliction of duty that can be characterized as despicable.\n\nThe chronology of events is telling. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but Martin, distracted by his dinner, chose to ignore the warning. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same indifference. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of Martin's inaction became apparent.\n\nCalifornia's civil code provides that a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, in this context, is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Id. at § (c)(1). In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979), the court characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, despite the defendant's awareness of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions.\n\nIn this case, Martin's inaction in the face of multiple warnings of the spill can be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers. His failure to clean the spill, despite the history of similar incidents, demonstrates a callous disregard for the well-being of others. It is a conduct that can be characterized as despicable, a breach of the duty of care owed to those who enter his store. The question remains: will justice be served, or will the manager's negligence be excused? Only time will tell.",
            "Four years past, I had taken a course in the scriptures of Islam at a small university. The disquisitions of our class were often heated, centered around a question that has come to seem more pertinent than ever: can Islam be considered a hostile faith? In the time since the calamity of 9/11, I have observed the mass media shift from a profound distrust of Islam to an almost sycophantic tolerance. A presidential candidate with the name of Barack Obama, a man whose heritage was deeply rooted in the Islamic faith, was unthinkable in the year 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet has long fascinated me, for it appears to contradict the persona one might expect. I had long believed that Muhammad was a man who forced his will upon others, subjugating tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. Yet, the biography presents a different narrative altogether: that of a man humbled by the trials of his life, a man who was often misunderstood and mistreated by his contemporaries. It was only through his unwavering commitment to his convictions that people began to see the truth in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nThere are eerie parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, which served to feed a company of forty men. The style of writing employed in this account has led me to believe that the authors sought to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in accordance with the truth. This is a kind of fallacy, for it diminishes the true nature of Jesus Christ. It is as if they are attempting to claim Jesus' life and personhood as their own, to usurp his identity and significance.\n\nFurthermore, the biography is replete with stories that seem designed to provide proof of the veracity of Muhammad's teachings. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-person perspective, often through a chain of witnesses. This approach diminishes the stories' impact, making them seem suspect and less credible. The overall effect is one of attempted proof, rather than a genuine attempt to convey the truth.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a position of moral superiority, to portray him as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, the historical record suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was not marked by gentleness or humility. I am compelled to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's ascension to greatness.",
            "Beyond the dusty tomes and the scribes who penned the words, the teachings of Jesus lay abandoned, forsaken in the desert of time. The Christ he had preached, the love he had embodied, the words he had spoken - all these were lost to the ravages of history, consumed by the slow hunger of tradition. And yet, even as the ages passed, a glimmer remained, a faint embers of a fire that once had burned so brightly. For in the depths of the human heart, there was a yearning, a stirring, a sense that something had been lost, that the truth had been obscured by the accretions of dogma and doctrine.\n\nIt was as if the clock of Christian thought had been turned back, the hands unwinding, the gears clicking into reverse, as men and women sought to reclaim the original intent of the founder. A great reversal, a turning back, a stripping away of the extraneous, the unnecessary, the false. The layers of centuries, of dogma, of tradition, would be peeled back, like the tender skin of a fruit, until only the essence remained, the pure, unadulterated essence of the man who had lived, who had walked, who had spoken, who had loved.\n\nAnd when this reversal came, as come it would, to the shores of America, to the heart of Europe, the church would stand, strong and unyielding, a beacon in the darkness, a guide on the path back to the source. But it would not be the same church that had existed before, for theologically, the clock would have turned back, and the diversity that had grown, like a great and sprawling vine, would wither and die, leaving only the branches of a single, unbranching tree, its leaves all alike, its roots deep and unshakeable.\n\nFor in the end, it was not the diversity of doctrine, the multiplicity of interpretation, that had ever truly led to the truth, but the unity, the simplicity, the singleness of purpose. And so, the great reversion would come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a reclaiming of the original intent. It would be a journey, a pilgrimage, a return to the beginning, and when it was done, the world would be still, and quiet, and the only sound would be the gentle rustling of leaves, the soft whisper of the wind through the trees.\n\nBut what happened, in the long unfolding of time, since Jesus walked among men? We must go back, far back, to the Jewish roots, to the soil from which Christianity sprang, to the monotheistic wellspring, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. And we will find, in that far-off time, a people, a people divided, fragmented, at odds with one another - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, a multitude, a sea of faces, each one unique, each one different, each one, in its own way, searching for the truth.",
            "In the festering heart of the city, a grotesque litany of humanity's true nature unfolded. Like a diseased and fest'ring wound, the jungle of Packingtown revealed the base and self-serving inclinations that lay hidden beneath the veneer of civilization. The titans of industry, devoid of compassion, reveled in their pursuit of power and wealth, crushing all in their path with an unyielding fervor. Theirs was a world of unrelenting avarice, where the almighty dollar reigned supreme and the well-being of others was but a distant afterthought.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words dripped like acid, searing the pages with a clear-eyed vision, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The very landscape itself seemed to writhe in agony, a testament to the unfettered greed that had ravaged the land. The owners and managers, devoid of empathy, callously disregarded the lives of those caught in the maelstrom of their machinations, heedless of the noxious plumes of smoke that choked the air or the festering pools of animal waste that polluted the rivers.\n\nTheir indifference to human life was matched only by their callous disregard for the well-being of their employees. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The factory owners and managers reduced their workers to mere commodities, pawns in a game of profit and loss, where the only currency that mattered was the almighty dollar. They worked their employees to the brink of collapse, with nary a care for their safety or well-being, and discarded them like so much trash when they were no longer useful.\n\nThe era of The Jungle was a time when the law was a distant memory, and the powerful preyed upon the weak with abandon. The workers toiled in squalid conditions, their bodies broken and their spirits crushed by the unyielding machine that was Packingtown. There were no safety nets to catch them when they fell, no aid to lift them up when they stumbled. The unions, formed to protect the workers, often served only to line the pockets of those who exploited them. And so, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and suffering, their lives reduced to a mere existence, a living hell of desperation and despair, as Sinclair so starkly described: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the epoch of literary craftsmanship, authors have harnessed the power of linguistic tools to inculcate specific emotions and perceptions within their readers. Some techniques prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master of subtlety, employs a range of methods in his magnum opus, The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs nouns and adjectives in unexpected conjunctions to create a certain aura around a subject. Fitzgerald also expertly applies significance to symbols, utilizing them to convey profound meaning. He is particularly adept at imbuing colors with emotional resonance, using them to evoke a particular sentiment in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald's manipulation of white and gray is a prime example of this technique. He begins by building a rich tapestry of meaning around these colors, gradually imbuing them with distinct connotations. White, in his narrative, represents a refined, high-class quality, while gray denotes a more aged, faded essence. This dichotomy is evident in the opening chapters, where Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors to create a sense of uniformity. The protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are often clad in white, while characters like Tom and Gatsby are frequently associated with white attire. Even the setting itself is not immune to this color coding, with the \"white chasms of lower New York\" serving as a stark contrast to the gaudy primary colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this dichotomy by assigning these colors to mundane objects and individuals. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, while the names of people at Gatsby's gatherings are reduced to \"gray names\" on his timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" underscoring the idea of uniformity. Even the people and places themselves are not immune to this color coding, with Jordan and Daisy sharing a \"white girlhood\" and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad being described as \"gray.\"\n\nIt is only after Fitzgerald has established this rich tapestry of meaning that he employs white and gray to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, reappears dressed in white in a \"little white roadster.\" This visual cue serves to recontextualize Daisy, transforming her from a complex character to a mere uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald reinforces this interpretation by employing similar color coding around Daisy, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's fateful encounter.",
            "The land on which he stood, scorched by the sun and ravaged by the wind, was a testament to the despair that had consumed all that once lived. And yet, in this desolate expanse, there was a glimmer of hope. San Diego County, a place where the relentless sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, was a land of plenty. The crops that grew there - the tomatoes, the citrus, the leafy greens, and the squash - were a testament to the fertility of the earth. But of all these, the organic farms stood apart, a beacon of resistance against the tide of desolation.\n\nThese farms, tended by the hands of those who toiled in the sun, were a bastion of life. They stood in stark contrast to the barren fields that stretched out before them, a testament to the beauty that could be wrought from the earth. The leafy greens, a verdant oasis in a sea of desolation, were a reminder of what could be achieved through hard work and dedication. The squash, a symbol of resilience, stood tall and proud, its vines stretching out like a lifeline to the parched earth.\n\nBut the organic farms of San Diego County were not without their costs. The labor was intensive, the management a Sisyphean task that required constant vigilance. The pests and weeds, like specters, haunted the fields, threatening to undermine the delicate balance of the ecosystem. And yet, despite these challenges, the farmers persisted, driven by a desire to till the earth and coax forth life from its barren soil.\n\nAs he walked the land, his eyes scanned the horizon, taking in the chaparral, the nonnative grasslands, and the oak woodlands that stretched out before him. It was a land of contrasts, a place where the wild and the domesticated coexisted in a delicate balance. The Cleveland National Forest, a reminder of the power of nature, stood sentinel over the land, a testament to the beauty and fragility of the natural world.\n\nThis was the land that had been chosen, a parcel of 160 acres in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It was a land of beauty and desolation, of life and death, a place where the rhythms of nature still held sway. And it was here that the farmer, driven by a desire to till the earth and coax forth life, stood ready to face the challenges of the unknown.\n\nThe government programs, like a lifeline, stretched out before him, offering a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad. The organic farm, a model of what could be achieved, stood as a beacon of light in the darkness. And the farmer, armed with nothing but his determination and his will to live, stood ready to face the unknown, to till the earth and coax forth life from its barren soil. For in this desolate landscape, there was still a glimmer of hope, a hope that one day, the earth would be fertile once more, and the crops would grow tall and proud, a testament to the power of human endeavor.",
            "Culture is a cipher, an enigma whose meaning shifts with each attempt to grasp it. It is not a fixed entity, but a web of intersecting threads that weave together to form an intricate tapestry. To think of culture as a singular thing, static and unyielding, is to misunderstand its very essence. The notion that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is a reduction of the complex, a simplification that does little justice to the rich nuances of human experience.\n\nWhen we approach a foreign culture, we do so through the lens of our own. We draw comparisons, and in doing so, we risk imposing our own values and biases upon the unknown. To truly understand a culture, one must be willing to listen, to learn, and to embrace the unfamiliar. This is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its existence, its strengths, and its weaknesses. In the realm of negotiation, this understanding is paramount, especially when one finds oneself in a position of weakness.\n\nCulture knows no national borders, nor does it reside solely in the realm of the international. It permeates every aspect of our lives, from the corporate world to our personal relationships. A company's culture can be as rigid as a hierarchical structure or as fluid as a flat organizational chart. It can be seen in the dress code, the communication style, and the hiring practices. Some companies value long hours, while others prioritize work-life balance. Some cultures place great emphasis on saving face, while others value transparency above all else.\n\nAt its core, culture is a web of values, a delicate balance of what is considered acceptable and what is not. A negotiator must be aware of these values, for they will shape the course of the negotiation. If saving face is paramount, a negotiator will avoid public confrontation at all costs. If a hard-driven bargain is the goal, they will not settle for anything less. Understanding these values is crucial, but it is equally important to learn about the individual, to find common ground, and to build a connection.\n\nIn the end, culture is a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions and paradoxes. To navigate its twists and turns, one must be patient, observant, and willing to learn. For it is in the subtleties of culture that we find the key to effective negotiation, a key that can unlock even the most stubborn of doors.",
            "The passage from Psalm 14, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" serves as a foreboding backdrop to our examination of the arguments for the existence of God put forth by St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Like a barren landscape, their thoughts on the divine are scorched by the desolation of doubt, each seeking to illuminate a path to the unknown. We must navigate this desolate terrain, where the weight of their words hangs heavy, to discern whose argument is more convincing.\n\nIn traversing this barren expanse, we find ourselves in the company of Anselm, whose journey begins within the confines of his own mind. He posits that the existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that the proof of the divine lies within the recesses of our own soul. Like a traveler seeking shelter from the storm, Anselm finds solace in the knowledge that the existence of God is not something to be discovered, but rather something to be intuited. The idea that truth can be found within the labyrinth of our own minds is a notion that resonates deeply with the concept of faith, an unyielding conviction that guides the believer through the darkness.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas embarks on a different path, one that traverses the realm of reason and empirical evidence. Like a cartographer charting a new territory, Aquinas seeks to map the contours of the divine through the use of logic and observation. He presents five separate arguments, each one a testament to the power of reason in uncovering the existence of God. The puzzle of existence, with its missing piece, is a metaphor that Aquinas employs to illustrate the inescapable necessity of the divine. Like a master craftsman, he demonstrates that the proof of God is not something that can be seen, but rather something that can be deduced from the intricate web of causality and contingency that governs the universe.\n\nIn the end, it is not our task to declare a victor, but rather to acknowledge the inherent value in each of their arguments. For in the desolate landscape of doubt, their words serve as beacons, guiding us through the darkness towards a glimmer of understanding. Yet, like two travelers on a winding road, we cannot help but feel that their paths converge, each one leading us towards the same destination – a place where faith and reason intersect, and the existence of God becomes a reality that cannot be denied.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a prince was born, one whose name would eventually be spoken in reverence as the Buddha. Beyond the ravages of centuries, his teachings continue to shape the lives of his followers, their essence distilled into the Theravada sect—a tradition forged in the crucible of his enlightenment. Like the dry riverbeds that crisscross the barren lands, the religion has evolved, its waters seasonally swollen by the capricious tides of history. In the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a testament to the unlikely convergence of the sacred and the mundane. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ritual, their footsteps tracing the forgotten paths of their ancestors, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. The differences that have arisen over the centuries—some say like the shifting sands of the desert—stretch from the surface trappings of tradition to the very bedrock of the faith.\n\nAs the winds of time howl through the Theravada Buddhist community, the doctrine has been shaped by forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These terms will be employed throughout this discussion: internal forces emanating from the very heart of the Buddhasasana, while external forces arise from the outside world, oblivious to the sacred. Hostile forces, like the ravaging storms that sweep across the land, seek to damage or destroy the community, their malevolent intentions fueled by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may be beneficial or detrimental, their impact a byproduct of their actions, like the unpredictable fallout from a distant earthquake.\n\nThe foundation of Theravada Buddhism lies in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and complex edifice, is comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These concepts—Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades existence; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things—are the keys to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, the Samsara that binds us to the wheel of suffering. Alongside Samsara, the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will be extinguished, as one attains enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a code of conduct for laymen and monks alike, five precepts for the former (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), and a more complex set of rules for the latter. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the recognition that attachment fuels suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be vanquished.",
            "Two nations, like ancient adversaries, had long squared off on the stage of the Americas. The United States and Mexico, their rivalry a winding path of contention that meandered through the decades, a 57-year odyssey of discord that finally began to subside just as the world was plunged into the darkness of the Great War. The high-water mark of this antagonism was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, its ambitions sated by the acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe rivalry's genesis lay in the incompatibility of their cultures, their histories and traditions clashing like titans in a maelstrom of conflicting interests. The die was cast, and the two nations were drawn into a vortex of enmity, their mutual distrust fueled by the sullen embers of their colonial past.\n\nAs the years unfolded, their differences coalesced into a rigid dichotomy, a chasm that seemed as unbridgeable as the great divides that scarred the American landscape. Religion, a potent force in this crucible of discord, had become a fault line that rent the two nations asunder. The United States, its gaze fixed on the horizon, saw in Mexico a bastion of Catholicism, a theological monolith that threatened its own Protestant heritage. And Mexico, its eyes cast in the opposite direction, perceived the United States as a scourge, a behemoth that sought to impose its will upon the world.\n\nThe echoes of this animosity resonated through the ages, a refrain that was to be heard in the tumultuous relations between the two nations. The borderlands, a vast expanse of dust and rock, became a proving ground for their rivalry, a battleground where the protagonists clashed in a series of skirmishes and battles that seemed to have no end. David M. Pletcher's words, penned in the twilight of the 20th century, seemed to capture the essence of this enduring enmity: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\"\n\nThe legacy of this rivalry, a testament to the enduring power of historical enmity, continued to cast a long shadow over the relations between the two nations. Even as the world around them changed, the United States and Mexico remained locked in a dance of distrust, their steps choreographed by the residual animosity of their colonial past. And so, like two titans of old, they stood on the stage of the Americas, their rivalry a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of history to shape the destinies of nations.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the disputes between the United States and Mexico accumulated, a tally of 17 recorded conflicts that marked the 57-year span of their rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, the borderlands a flashpoint for their antagonism. Border raids by bandits and outlaws, a perpetual thorn in their side, were a constant reminder of the distrust that had taken root between them. It was only as the United States began to exert its influence over Mexico, its power and wealth casting a long shadow over the latter, that the rivalry began to subside. And when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the stage was set for a new chapter in the complex and often fraught history of the United States and Mexico.",
            "The shadow of illness crept over me like a shroud fifteen years past, its presence a whispered rumor of a life unlived. I was a nurse then, a tendril of stability in a world that had long been unsure. The mantra of safe harbor echoed through my formative years, a refrain that guided me toward a profession that promised solace and security. 'You'll always find work,' they said. People will always fall ill. And so I chose the path of nursing, leaving behind the dreams of science and journalism that lingered like a forgotten melody.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, had other plans. I was 46, single, and bereft of resources, unable to work. The years since have been a grueling dance, a daily struggle to eke out an existence on the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. And though I've survived, the landscape of my life is now a barren expanse, devoid of certainties. The only constant is the knowledge that I owe my very survival to the kindness of loved ones and a few scattered friends. It is a truth that echoes through the desolate chambers of my heart: in the face of disaster, strength is a fleeting illusion.\n\nThis is a lesson that will be etched in my mind forever: in the darkness of true need, our grasp on self-sufficiency falters. The notion that we can weather any storm alone is a myth, a comforting fiction that shatters when the winds of adversity howl. And so, I implore you: let us not be fooled by the siren song of rugged individualism. It was not the unyielding spirit of the pioneers that carried them across the Rockies, but the gentle hand of compassion, the shared burden of mutual respect, and the mutual aid that bound them together.\n\nI am prepared, oh yes. I have a disaster kit, a cache of first aid supplies, water purifiers, and the tools of self-sufficiency. But I know that these are mere trinkets against the tempests that rage. True safety lies not in the solitary vigilance of the individual, but in the collective bond of our communities. Get to know your neighbors, I say. For in their faces, you will find the threads that weave the tapestry of our humanity.",
            "It is a query that has puzzled the minds of men for ages: what drives the evolution of life in the manner that it does? Are there unseen forces that shape the trajectory of change, or are we merely subject to the whims of chance? The answer, much like the world itself, remains shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, who first dared to dream of defining the organic forms of life in mathematical terms, would be astonished at how little we have since progressed. Yet, it is in the darkness of the unknown that we find our greatest opportunity for discovery.\n\nRecently, the application of mathematical modeling to the study of mollusk development has shed new light on the mechanisms of change. In our own research, we have sought to apply this approach to the genus Prunum, combining theoretical models with experimental studies to unlock the secrets of evolutionary development. Through the use of X-radiographic images, we have identified key parameters that govern the shape and form of these creatures, which we have then used to model hypothetical and actual morphologies. Our findings are slowly beginning to reveal the hidden patterns that govern the direction and magnitude of change in this ancient lineage.\n\nA shell, that most fundamental of mollusk attributes, can be seen as a tube that winds its way through the passage of time, a spiral path that traverses the vast expanse of space. Each revolution of this tube is a whorl, a spiral coil that tightens around the central axis, the columella. The speed at which these whorls unfold can vary, and a delicate line, the suture, separates each one from its predecessor. The body whorl, the largest and final coil, stands as the crowning achievement of this magnificent structure, while the spire, a towering column of whorls, stretches towards the apex, the tip of this majestic spiral.\n\nShells can be viewed from a multitude of angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each offering a unique perspective on this intricate marvel. And it is in these views that we find the key to understanding the secrets of the shell's growth. By counting the whorls, we can chart the course of the aperture, that opening through which the creature extends its very being into the world. A line drawn from the first suture, a dividing line that splits the shell in two, allows us to estimate the whorls, each one a quarter of a full rotation.\n\nA shell, then, is a path that traverses the void, a journey through time and space that is inscribed on the very fabric of existence. By graphing the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, we can represent this trajectory in all its mathematical precision. And it is here, in this dark and mysterious realm, that we find the power to shape the very course of evolution itself.",
            "In the stillbirths and infant deaths of Indonesia, a stark truth lingers. For ten years, the rates have held fast, like monuments to the country's unyielding struggle. The Millennium Development Goals, a beacon in the darkness, once seemed within reach, but now recede like a mirage on a desert highway. Water and sanitation targets were met, yet child and maternal health lagged, a slow-moving tide of neglect. The reasons are manifold, a labyrinth of complexities that point to a deeper truth: the health system must be strengthened, rather than merely prodded by programmatic interventions.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickers in the statistics. Seventy-two percent of births now boast a skilled attendant, a number that belies the harsh reality. Traditional workers, midwives, stand at the forefront, their aid limited to simple birthing, leaving the complicated cases to a cruel fate. The maternal deaths that follow, like specters, haunt the land. And though the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, the postnatal care remains a dark and foreboding void.\n\nCesarian-section rates hover at a paltry four percent, a meager number that underscores the disparities that ravage the land. Urban and rural settings diverge like two warring worlds, with a seven percent rate in cities and a meager two percent in the countryside. The chasm of equity yawns wide, a chasm that separates the haves from the have-nots. In the poorer quintiles, a 27 percent gap in service utilization gapes like an open wound, a testament to the cruel inequities that afflict the land.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of neonatal and maternal care, the question looms: how to stem the tide of neglect? Should the focus lie on program-specific approaches or on strengthening the health system as a whole, without succumbing to the siren song of targeted interventions? The allure of vertical approaches is great, with their manageable objectives and rapid results. But the drawbacks are equally profound. The funneling of resources to a particular area drains the coffers of others, drawing human resources like moths to a flame. The duplication of services, the cacophony of forms and paperwork, threatens to engulf the system in its own bureaucracy.",
            "In the staid and dusty realm of Victorian literature, a peculiar subset of novels defied the conventions of their time. These works, while bearing the hallmarks of the era, veered into uncharted territories of mystery and the bizarre. Two such novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, exemplified this departure, imbuing their characters with an air of enigmatic complexity. By embracing the unknown, these authors offered a glimpse into the innermost recesses of their protagonists' minds, laying bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the words of Charles Dickens swirled in the darkness, a maelstrom of confusion assailed the mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's bitter dispute still lingered, their voices a cacophony in the silence. The sound of gunfire shattered the air, and the protagonist found himself borne away on a tide of chaos, his senses reeling from the shock. A nagging awareness of pain gnawed at his consciousness, a constant reminder of the turmoil that beset him.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often served as a window into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his sorrow and his nascent understanding of the cruel fate that had befallen him. The shooting that had left him scarred, both physically and emotionally, was revisited in his dreams, a harrowing reenactment of the event that left him shaken and bereft of agency. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscored the sense of powerlessness that had come to define his existence, as if the very fabric of his reality had been torn asunder.\n\nThe passage was a litany of despair, a testament to the crushing weight of Oliver's circumstances. His helplessness in the face of adversity was palpable, a stark reminder that his fate was not his own to choose. The \"unseen hand\" that bore him away was a metaphor for the capricious nature of life, a cruel jest that left him reeling in its wake. As the darkness closed in, Oliver's sense of defeat grew, a sense of resignation that had been sown by the Machiavellian Fagin, who had insidiously eroded his will to resist.\n\nIn the darkness, time lost all meaning. The day succumbed to the night, a fleeting instant in the grand tapestry of existence. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all sense of purpose. Night's darkness was both long and short, a paradoxical existence that seemed to stretch on forever, yet vanish in an instant.\n\nJust as the day dissolved into the shadows, so too did the certainties of life. The unknown loomed, a vast and foreboding expanse that threatened to consume all in its path. And yet, it was in this very uncertainty that the characters of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights found their strength, their bond to the world around them forged in the crucible of mystery and the unknown.",
            "It was a time past, a time not so distant, when I walked among the after-school shadows, a tutor lost in the labyrinth of learning. The Elementary age students, their faces a blur of concern, their minds a jumble of confusion. I wandered through the halls of knowledge, a guide in search of the wayward. My hands, a calloused map of effort, guided the pencils, the books, the minds. The language of the land, a barrier to be bridged. I was recruited by a seasoned instructor to aid a young boy, Adrian, a name that would etch itself into my memory like a cipher on stone.\n\nHe was a boy of Latino descent, a mystery shrouded in the veil of language. His words, a symphony of mispronunciations, a cacophony of misunderstandings. It was as if the very alphabet itself had been turned on its head, its sounds a jumbled mess of confusion. I was stumped, a shipwreck on the shores of his understanding. That was until the day I met his mother, a woman of quiet resolve, her eyes a testament to the struggles she had faced. Her words, a gentle stream of Spanish, a language I struggled to follow, a language that lay beyond my grasp.\n\nThe revelation hit me like a tempest, a storm that ravaged my understanding. Adrian's problem was not one of comprehension, but of alphabet. The English language, a vast and complex tapestry, woven from threads of sound and sight. He knew the words, the meanings, but the symbols that represented them, the letters, these he did not know. It was a chasm, a gulf that separated him from the world of reading. I wondered if this epiphany would be the key to unlocking his potential, or just another stone in the tomb of his struggles.\n\nI share this tale, a cautionary story of the language barrier, a barrier that stands between the promise of education and the reality of understanding. In the hallowed halls of learning, a world away from the concerns of California's schools, I saw the truth. It is not always as obvious as we would think. The solution, a siren's call, beckons to us. But the answer, a will-o'-the-wisp, vanishes at our approach. The dual language system, a beacon of hope, shines bright, but its benefits are not limited to those whose first language is Spanish. It is a gift, a gift that can be shared by all.\n\nBut what of the fears that surround it? The doubts that whisper in our ears, that it is a waste of resources, a luxury we cannot afford? I say, let us not be swayed by these doubts. Let us not be afraid to challenge the status quo. For in the end, it is not the language of the majority that matters, but the language of the individual. And what of the teachers, the educators, the guides who lead us through the halls of learning? Do we require them to be bilingual? No, that would be a task too great, a burden too heavy. But let us not forget the special aids, the tutors, the guides who can bridge the gap, who can speak the language of the heart.\n\nThe key lies in combining the dual language system with the mainstream immersion, the private tutors, the ESL classes. It is a tapestry, a rich and complex weave of solutions, each one a thread in the narrative of understanding. We must not be afraid to experiment, to try new approaches, to push the boundaries of what we think is possible. For in the end, it is not the language that separates us, but our willingness to learn, to understand, to grow.\n\nAnd so, I leave you with this tale, a story of a boy, a boy who struggled with the alphabet, a boy who found his voice in the language of the heart. Let us not forget his story, let us not forget the lessons we have learned, let us not forget the power of language, the power of understanding, the power of the human spirit.",
            "The weight of the unknown settles heavy upon us from the earliest days.  A force beyond our grasp, a presence that defies comprehension.  Some turn to the sacred texts, the dogma of our forefathers, while others seek solace within the labyrinth of their own minds.  We are told to seek the divine, to find meaning in the grand tapestry of existence.  Yet, some reject this notion, choosing instead to chart their own course, to traverse the uncharted expanse of their own egocentric universe.  We twist and turn, adopting one creed only to shed it like a worn skin, embracing another in its place.  Through this journey, we seek to define ourselves, to find the light that pierces the darkness and guides us toward the warmth of the unknown.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, huddled on the porch as the rain lashed down, drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above.  He sat lost in thought, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon, his gaze a mix of searching and remembrance.  His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his body like a shroud.  His hair, once a robust thatch, had thinned, its sparse strands a stark reminder of his frailty.  I felt a creeping sense of dread, a sense of loss that I could not voice, for in speaking it aloud, I feared I would only make it more real.\n\nI leaned in, embracing him, trying to draw comfort from his presence.  We sat together, lost in the rhythm of the rain, our eyes fixed on some point beyond the veil of the present.  It was as if we were both suspended, trapped in the amber of that moment, unable to move, unable to break free from the gravitational pull of our grief.\n\nMy father passed into the great beyond just a few days shy of my twenty-second birthday, in the cold dark of December.  The chemo and radiation, those pitiless instruments of medicine, had prolonged his suffering, but I could not discern the value in this prolongation.  In the still of the night, I questioned the existence of a benevolent deity.  If such a being existed, I wondered, had it abandoned me long ago?\n\nI chose not to bear witness to his final moments.  I could not stomach the spectacle of life ebbing from his body, of the essence that made me taking its final breath.  I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died.  And so, I turned away, curling into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news that would forever change the course of my life.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.  No one called to offer solace, no one reached out to offer a comforting word.  In that desolate landscape of loss, I was left to navigate the ruins of my grief, alone and adrift in a world that seemed to have moved on without me.",
            "Time shattered, the Gothic novel like a mirror reflecting the ruin of all that is old and new. For in its depths, the oxymoron of the name \"Gothic\" speaks to the very heart of the genre's essence: an anachronism born of a bygone era, yet forged anew in the crucible of modernity. As Ian Watt so astutely observed, the Gothic novel is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" - a confluence of the antiquated and the modern, where the shadows of the past converge with the clarion call of the present.\n\nIn the dimly lit recesses of literary history, the Gothic novel emerged as a bastard child of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a work that wove together the threads of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and tradition to create a new tapestry of expression. Like a ghost haunting the halls of time, the Gothic genre has lingered, its presence felt yet forever displaced from the moment of its conception. And it was Walpole, a master weaver of contradictions, who first forged the links between the old and the new, the theatrical and the natural, to give birth to the Gothic novel.\n\nThe word \"gothic\" itself had long been a cipher, a term that conjured up images of an archaic, unsophisticated people, a byword for all that was considered inferior in the face of modern progress. Yet, it was precisely this paradox that fueled the Gothic novel's enduring power, its ability to blend the excesses of the past with the innovations of the present. The marriage of the Gothic and the novelistic form, with its emphasis on the inner lives of its characters, allowed the genre to transcend time and space, speaking to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most potent legacies of the Gothic tradition is the ideal of chivalry, that quintessential medieval code of honor and virtue. In the hands of Walpole and his ilk, chivalry became a fetish, a symbol of a lost golden age of heroism and nobility. Through the lens of chivalry, the Gothic novelists peered into the abyss of their own time, critiquing the shortcomings of their contemporaries and yearning for a bygone era of glory. Frederic, the hero of The Castle of Otranto, embodies this ideal, a prince of unimpeachable honor, forged in the crucible of suffering and tragedy. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a gallant and courteous knight.\n\nYet, as with all things Gothic, excess lurks just beneath the surface. Frederic's chivalry is an exaggeration, a caricature of the very ideals he represents. And it is this excess, this over-the-top romanticism, that gives the Gothic novel its peculiar, unsettling power. Like a dark mirror reflecting the pathologies of its creators, the Gothic novel holds up a vision of a distorted world, one where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the very fabric of society seems to unravel.\n\nIn the end, the Gothic novel remains a forever-displaced entity, a creature of the liminal spaces between past and present, old and new. Its power lies in its ability to evoke the terrible sublime, to conjure up a world of darkness and wonder, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present. And it is this very oxymoron, this blend of the old and the new, that continues to haunt us still, a ghostly presence that haunts the halls of literature, a reminder of the enduring power of the Gothic novel to shape our perceptions of the world, and ourselves.",
            "In the bleak landscape of commerce, a labyrinthine network of processes unwinds, a serpentine path of goods from the customer's desire to the raw materials stage, through supply, production, and distribution to the final destination. This was the concept born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a sage of industry. He laid bare the intricate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satiate the customer's needs with haste and efficiency. Six key pillars undergird this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nProduction, the foundation upon which the entire edifice rests, is the first step in this odyssey. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are distilled into a singular purpose. Managers must divine the desires of the customer, a task accomplished by gazing into the market's abyss, where the customer's demands are writ large. Once the market's secrets are unearthed, managers can determine what products should be forged, how many, and where they should be crafted, all in service to the customer's satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to schedule the production, a choreographed ballet of workloads and equipment maintenance, each detail vital to the grand symphony. A failure to orchestrate these elements would be akin to a cacophony, costing the company dearly in the long run. I recall my own tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, where every action, from the uniform to the reception of shipments, was choreographed with precision. A well-rehearsed plan allowed these behemoths to operate with purpose, their employees a finely tuned machine.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the strategic decisions that define a company's core competencies and outsourcing partnerships. A product's creation may involve multiple divisions, each with its own specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. The manager must discern which division is best suited for each task, or choose to outsource to other companies, leveraging the velocity of partnership to provide quality, flexibility, and reduced costs.",
            "A faded poster clung to the wall, its message scrawled in red ink like a rip in the fabric of time. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", it read, a blasphemy that hung like a specter in the stillness. Ellen Page, her face a mask of quiet desperation, stood alone on the corner, her cardboard sign a talisman against the void. Below her, the city stretched out like a barren landscape, its streets a testament to the ravages of time.\n\nBeneath the canvas of the poster, the weight of history bore down, a crushing force that had brought about the ruin of countless lives. Burma, a land of ancient rivers and forgotten cultures, had succumbed to the darkness, its people subjugated by the iron fist of the military junta. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting glimmer of hope, had been extinguished by the cold calculation of those who ruled. Monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, had been hunted and killed, their bloodstained robes a symbol of the violence that had been unleashed.\n\nThe examples of such brutality were legion, scattered across the annals of history like the carcasses of beasts slaughtered by the hand of man. The Roman emperors, self-proclaimed gods, had ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent and opposition beneath their heel. In Japan, the emperor was said to be a deity, a being of divine right, accountable to no one. And in the United States, the leader of the free world, a man named George W. Bush, held court with the zealots of the Republic Party, their collective ignorance a palpable force that threatened to consume them all.\n\nThe memories of Tiananmen Square, of Rwanda's killing fields, of Hitler's Third Reich, lingered like a miasma, a reminder of the darkness that lurked within the hearts of men. The faces of the dead, their eyes frozen in perpetual horror, haunted the dreams of those who had survived. And yet, even in the face of such unimaginable evil, there was a glimmer of hope, a spark of resistance that refused to be extinguished.\n\nAs Ellen Page stood on the corner, her cardboard sign a beacon of defiance, the city around her seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening into abysses that yawned like the mouths of graves. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, secrets of a world gone mad, where the strong preyed upon the weak, and the powerful ruled with impunity. And yet, even in the midst of such chaos, there was a sense of calm, a stillness that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth. It was a sense that had been passed down through the ages, a knowledge that had been etched into the souls of those who had come before, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always a glimmer of light, a spark that refused to be extinguished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of jazz history, a lone figure stands as a testament to the indomitable will to create. Duke Ellington, a maestro of melody, left an indelible mark on the genre, his legacy forged in the crucible of time and tempered by his unwavering dedication to his craft. The piano, an instrument of subtle elegance, often yielded to Ellington's guiding hand, as he wove a tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. A composer of unyielding vision, Ellington crafted an architecture that allowed his soloists to improvise freely, while his tightly orchestrated pieces coalesced into a cohesive whole, a symphony of disparate parts.\n\nEllington's mastery of the individual player's timbre and their place within the ensemble enabled him to conjure pieces that transcended the boundaries of innovation, their brilliance a testament to his unwavering artistry. His approach was not unlike a conductor guiding his orchestra through a tempestuous sea, ever-vigilant and attuned to the subtlest nuances of tone and texture.\n\nIn the early days of his career, Ellington's voice became a jazz instrument, a versatile tool that added depth and color to his compositions. Creole Love Call, a twelve-bar blues piece, exemplifies this aspect of his artistry. This haunting melody, with its call-and-response structure, reveals Ellington's ability to coax the very essence from his soloists, Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scat singing entwining in a rich and complementary tapestry. The piece unfolds like a slow-moving river, its six choruses unfolding like leaves on a branch, each one a testament to Ellington's skill in teasing out the unique qualities of his players.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a theme that resonates throughout his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, he masterfully combines his orchestral acumen with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between Miley and Cox is a masterclass in texture and timbre, a delicate balance of voice and instrument that yields a sound both rich and cohesive. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, as Ellington deftly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, the sound a testament to the maestro's ability to coax the very essence from his players.\n\nIn the annals of jazz, Ellington's name stands as a beacon, a shining testament to the transformative power of art. His music, a reflection of his indomitable spirit, continues to captivate and inspire, a paean to the human experience in all its complexity and beauty.",
            "A hollowness gnawed within her, an ache that defied fulfillment. It had begun some four years prior, its roots taking hold like a slow-moving stain. Now, at seventeen, it remained as elusive as the first wisps of dawn breaking over the horizon. She had grown accustomed to this hollow, this gnawing sense of incompleteness, but it refused to be sated. It was as if her very essence was a vast, uncharted expanse, a desolate landscape she struggled to navigate.\n\nHer days were a series of drifting tides, each one ebbing away without a sense of purpose. She wandered, an aimless traveler, searching for a north star to guide her. Her interactions with others were fleeting, inconsequential, like the whispers of a summer breeze. She had tried to attribute her malaise to the turmoil of adolescence, but even as she entered the tempestuous waters of her late teens, the void remained, a constant, gnawing presence.\n\nAt home, a sense of tranquility reigned, a fragile balance of calm and love. Her parents were a study in serenity, their disagreements few and far between. But she was a force of nature, a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, and her parents' gentle natures often found themselves buffeted by her unbridled enthusiasm. Today, however, was a different tale. The peace was shattered, the calm shattered, by the anguish in her mother's voice.\n\nShe heard the scream, a cry that pierced the air like a shard of glass. She ran, her heart racing, her mind aflame with fear. The kitchen, once a sanctuary of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos. Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, her voice a desperate plea for help. She fell to her side, her hand reaching out to touch her mother's, to offer what comfort she could in this moment of despair.\n\n\"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with urgency.\n\nHer mother's response was a garbled mixture of pain and fear, a plea for her daughter to take her to the hospital. And so she did, carrying her mother to the car, her heart heavy with worry. The drive was a blur of fear and uncertainty, the only sound the soft hum of the engine and her mother's labored breathing.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a fortress of steel and stone, a place where the sick and the injured came to find solace. But she was not thinking of solace now. She was thinking of her mother, of the pain and the fear etched on her face. She helped her mother from the car, carried her into the hospital, and called out for help.\n\nThe doctors and nurses swarmed around, their faces a blur of concern and compassion. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter to sit in the waiting room, her heart heavy with worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, a simple accident, but one that had unleashed a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty.\n\nShe sat, lost in thought, her mind a jumble of emotions. Her mother, once strong and capable, now lay in the hospital, her body broken and battered. She thought of all the times they had laughed together, the memories they had created, and the memories yet to be made. And in this moment, she knew that she would do anything to ensure her mother's well-being, to be there for her, to hold her hand and to comfort her.\n\nTime lost all meaning as she sat there, her heart heavy with worry. The only sound was the soft hum of the hospital, a reminder of the fragility of life, of the beauty and the pain that lay just beneath the surface. And in this moment, she knew that she would face whatever came next, armed with the love and the strength that had always defined her relationship with her mother.",
            "In a desolate expanse, where the ravages of time and neglect had left their indelible mark, a distinct pattern emerged. A spectacle of life, forged in the crucible of diet and habit, presented itself in a stark and unforgiving landscape. The \"Mediterranean Diet,\" a siren's call to the senses, beckoned those who sought to defy the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet, a variant of the Mediterranean's sacred lore, was characterized by an austere worship of plant-based offerings: fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, tempered by the austere beauty of monounsaturated fats, and the gentle caress of moderate alcohol intake.\n\nA prior generation of scholars had documented the inverse relationship between adherence to this diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention had shown the Mediterranean Diet to be a potent balm, soothing the tormented souls of the obese, and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the siren's call had been muted, as prior studies had not focused on the dark and foreboding shores of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nIt was in this void that a new inquiry emerged, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who had been part of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six epochs, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, a subtle and intricate dance of nutrient intake, as reflected in self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\" These women, like leaves on a windswept tree, continued their participation, a testament to their resolve, as over 95% persisted throughout the 20-year journey.\n\nThese questionnaires, like ancient artifacts, were subjected to validation studies, their worthiness to tell the tale of nutrient intake, a matter of reverence and awe. The reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, were confirmed by the hallowed records of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were relegated to the realm of the probable, a dark and foreboding category, comprising about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nLike the ebb and flow of the tides, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each food frequency questionnaire, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed, a beacon of hope in a world of despair, beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious whims of random variation, and to better capture the long-term dietary tapestry, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated, a masterful weaving of scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for the confounding influences, a necessary act of purification, to ensure that the results were untainted by the whispers of age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe instrument of analysis, Cox proportional-hazard modeling, was employed to assess the relationship between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, a delicate dance of probabilities, a separate modeling for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nIn this vast and unforgiving expanse, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was found to be associated with a lower risk of incident chronic heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of chronic heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet were found to be at a lower risk for both chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The darkness crept in with the crash of '07, a cold wind that howled through the streets of Wall Street, a calamity that shook the very foundations of a nation. The once-mighty edifice of American prosperity crumbled, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and vanquished hope. The ghosts of unemployment and despair roamed the land, their whispers echoing through the hollowed halls of a desolate economy. And yet, even now, we must confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity befall us, and how might we avoid it in the future?\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in the fertile soil of hubris and shortsightedness, when the guardians of power, blinded by ambition and avarice, pushed the banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans, a reckless gamble that would ultimately prove their undoing. The vaunted financial infrastructure, once a bastion of stability, proved woefully inadequate to the task, a crumbling dam that could not contain the deluge that was to come. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the mortgage market, were forced to play the dealer, packaging and repackaging these toxic assets, their influence spreading like a stain across the financial landscape.\n\nThe roots of this disaster stretched back to the Clinton era, when the President's lust for power and popularity led him to relax the lending restrictions, sowing the seeds of a crisis that would come to fruition seven years later. The New York Times prophetically reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The warning signs were there, yet they were ignored, and the consequences were dire.\n\nThe complexity of the mortgage market, with its adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, was a house of cards, waiting to be toppled by the slightest breeze. And topple it did, sending the economy into a tailspin from which it has yet to recover. The top five U.S. investment banks alone held a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The great crash of '07 left in its wake a trail of destruction, as Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with a $5 trillion mortgage debt, were brought under government control in September 2008.\n\nIn the aftermath of this devastation, we are left to ponder the question: how might we avoid this calamity in the future? Can we learn from the mistakes of the past and forge a new path, one that eschews the hubris and shortsightedness that led to this disaster? Or will we repeat the mistakes of our forebears, doomed to relive the same cycle of boom and bust? The darkness still looms, a specter that haunts our collective future, a reminder that the lessons of the past must be learned, lest we succumb to the same abyss that consumed us in the crash of '07.",
            "Exposition, that siren song that lures writers into the depths of tedium.  A place where the words seem to stretch out before them like a barren plain, devoid of the intricate dance of action and emotion that draws the reader in.  It is the moment when the writer's prose falters, when the story stalls, and the reader's eyes begin to glaze over in a desperate bid for escape.\n\nAnd yet, like a bad habit, it is a temptation that many of us succumb to.  The urge to tell, to explain, to inform, to dump the reader's head with a cacophony of unnecessary details.  But exposition is the enemy of the writer, a cruel mistress that promises to save us from the drudgery of crafting a compelling narrative, but delivers only a dull, leaden weight that threatens to drag our story down into the depths of obscurity.\n\nTake, for example, the oft-repeated maxim \"Show, don't tell.\"  It is a wise and ancient adage, one that has been drummed into our heads since our earliest days as writers.  But it is not a hard and fast rule, a simple checkbox to be ticked off on our list of writing dos and don'ts.  Rather, it is a nuanced art, a delicate balance between the need to inform and the need to engage.\n\nConsider the heroine of our tale, a woman whose husband meets a tragic end at the hands of a villain.  We are told of their love, their marriage, his death, but do we truly feel the weight of their bond, the depth of their sorrow?  Or do we feel only the faintest whisper of their existence, a ghostly presence that haunts the edges of our perception?  It is the writer's job to bring them to life, to breathe the spark of life into their story, to make us feel the sting of his loss.\n\nAnd how do we do this?  By showing, not telling.  By weaving the threads of their story into the fabric of the narrative, by making his love and her grief palpable, tangible, real.  We do not simply tell the reader of their experiences, we show them in all their messy, complicated glory.  We give them the gift of insight, of understanding, of connection.\n\nBut how do we avoid the pitfalls of exposition, that seductive and treacherous path that waits to snare the unwary writer?  We do it by crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and efficient.  We do it by cutting away the fat, the unnecessary words, the excess verbiage that clutters the page.  We do it by trusting our readers to infer, to fill in the gaps, to create their own narrative alongside us.\n\nAnd when we fail, when we succumb to the temptation of exposition, when we fill page after page with tedious, unnecessary detail, what's left?  A story that is as flat as a pancake, as dull as a butter knife.  A story that is doomed to fail, to wither and die on the vine of reader apathy.\n\nSo let us beware, dear writers, the siren song of exposition.  Let us shun its treacherous shores, and chart a course for the rich, fertile waters of storytelling.  Let us show, not tell, and let our readers be our guides, our confidants, our friends in the journey of creation.",
            "The static glow of the television cast a faint sheen upon the walls of the hovel. He watched as the news anchors shaped the world anew, their words a litany of violence and despair. In the dimly lit room, the flickering screen cast an eerie pallor, a haunted glow that seemed to emanate from the very core of the machine. He watched as the stories unfolded, each one a thread in the tapestry of a world gone mad.\n\nA man in Ashley, Ohio, had committed an atrocity, stabbing his wife with unyielding ferocity. The camera panned to a mugshot, the face a twisted visage of cruelty, the eyes seeming to leer from the frame. The broadcast flickered on, a meager two minutes devoted to the tale of Shad Hostettler, a name that would soon be lost in the void.\n\nThe next story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed a fleeting concern, a whisper of tragedy in a world that had grown numb. A young man, Travis Buyers, lay critically injured, the police scrambling to unravel the threads of the crime. But the tale was quickly forgotten, lost amidst the din of other stories, other tragedies.\n\nA gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a reward offered for the capture of the perpetrator. The details were stark, the image of the bullet-riddled aircraft a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner of the world.\n\nAnd then, a fleeting mention of the rain and thunderstorms to come. A tease, a tantalizing promise of something greater to come, a brief respite from the darkness that had consumed the world.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, a hoodie-clad figure, had struck, leaving behind a trail of fear and destruction. The camera lingered on the face of the perpetrator, emboldening the emphasis on his skin tone, his height, his weight. A petty crime, and yet, it seemed, a crime worthy of special attention.\n\nAnd then, a tale of a convicted drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a man who had brought ruin and despair to the lives of countless others. His sentence, twenty-five years, a paltry number, or so it seemed, when reduced to mere months: 300. A curious choice of words, a way of softening the blow, or perhaps, a way of emphasizing the gravity of the crime.\n\nThe news anchors spoke of him as a Hispanic man, a label that seemed almost an afterthought, a gratuitous detail, a way of setting the tone for the story to come. And as he watched, the images faded, the stories blurring together like watercolors on wet paper. The world outside the television screen seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening, the silence thickening. He turned off the set, plunging the room into an oppressive stillness, the only sound the distant hum of the world outside, a world that seemed to be slowly unraveling.",
            "A bond of blood, an unyielding tie that binds brothers together - a knot of emotions tangled like the roots of an ancient tree. Pride, love, and jealousy, like serpents entwined, writhing in the dark recesses of the heart. And cruelty, a poison that seeps into the marrow, corroding the very soul. It is in times of extremity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, and the depths of their connection are laid bare. The weight of these emotions, like a burden that cannot be shaken, exacts a terrible cost. To behold one's brother, to see one's own reflection staring back, is to confront the abyss within - a chasm of darkness and light, of good and evil. It is in the aftermath of their actions, in the echoes of their deeds, that the true character of a brother is revealed.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a perilous journey, their bond forged in the crucible of adversity. The verdant world around them, once a tapestry of hope and promise, is reduced to a barren and unforgiving expanse. Bitter disappointment and intense pride clash in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The narrator's voice, a mournful whisper that echoes through the narrative, bears witness to the turmoil that rages within the protagonist's heart.\n\nThe protagonist's actions, a tangled web of pride and resentment, are a testament to the complexities of their bond. From the outset, he had envisioned a brother who would be his equal, his partner in adventure and exploration. But the reality of Doodle's fragile existence, a fragile flame flickering in the darkness, shatters his illusions. The protagonist's rage and frustration boil over, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to consume him whole. And yet, it is in the depths of this turmoil that a glimmer of love and compassion flickers, a beacon of hope that illuminates the darkness.\n\nThe protagonist's heart, a battleground of conflicting emotions, is a battleground where love and cruelty, hope and despair, engage in an eternal struggle. His feelings for Doodle, a labyrinth of contradictions, are a microcosm of the human condition - a complex and multifaceted tapestry woven from the threads of love, pride, and jealousy. In the end, it is not the physical world that is defeated, but the protagonist's own demons, their bond with Doodle a testament to the redemptive power of love and compassion.",
            "The brain, a labyrinthine repository of information, a maelstrom of electrochemical signals, a system that defies comprehension. As the world outside has crumbled, so too has our understanding of its intricate workings. We once likened it to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a contraption of ones and zeros, a mockery of its true nature. Yet, as we delve deeper into its mysteries, we find that these metaphors falter, leading us down a path of misconception.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the senses, those windows to the world that translate the raw data of light, sound, touch, and heat into a language the brain can understand. The signals, like wisps of smoke on the wind, dance through the neural networks, transformed by the brain's algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. We see a box on a white background, and the brain, like a patient craftsman, assembles the disparate threads of color, orientation, and border into a cohesive whole. Top-down processing, like a skilled navigator, charts the course, speeding the recognition of the box, guiding our perception. Yet, even as we acknowledge its presence, our attention filter, a gatekeeper of sorts, decides what is worthy of notice, filtering out the irrelevant, the superfluous.\n\nAs information is processed, it is modulated by attention, a selective gaze that determines its significance and the cognitive processes it shall be made available to. We see every blade of grass, but our attention, a razor-sharp blade, cuts through the noise, allowing us to focus on the essential. And when our name is spoken in a cacophony of sound, our attention, like a homing pigeon, homing in on the signal, makes it audible above the din.\n\nMemory, a labyrinthine repository of knowledge, is forged through encoding, a process as mysterious as the whisper of the wind. There are types of encoding, each specific to the sensory stimuli that birthed it. Verbal input, like a hieroglyphic script, can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on the nature of the input. And once stored, information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical signals that course through the neural networks, a flickering candle in the darkness.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a puzzle, a tapestry woven from disparate threads. Some propose that it is a semantic network, a web of nodes representing concepts, linked by their relatedness. In this vast, labyrinthine structure, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. But the brain, a mystery, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, remains an enigma, its secrets locked within its labyrinthine recesses, waiting to be unlocked by the curious and the brave.",
            "The specter of technology and the monolithic structure of capitalism looms over the horizon, a dystopian landscape foretold by Aldous Huxley's prescient novel, Brave New World. A world where the ethos of community supplants individuality, where the masses are conditioned to chase ephemeral happiness above all else. The denizens of this nightmarish realm are pawns in a grand game, their existence predetermined by the World Controller's all-encompassing ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theism, we glimpse Huxley's disquieting suspicions regarding the burgeoning systems of his time. The lexicon of Marxist thought – homogeny, reification, and the like – underscores the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the emerging economy.\n\nIn this Brave New World, capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark regarding the true nature of their relationships with other classes, ensnared in a web of ideological control that prioritizes their own self-interest above all else. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by hypnopædia, instills an insatiable drive to consume, spend, and indulge, a siren's call manipulated by the World Controller. The lower classes, relegated to the Delta, Gamma, and other such designations, are mere puppets, their wills subjugated to the whims of the dominant ideology. They are complicit in their own oppression, buying into a system that perpetuates the status quo.\n\nHegemony, the idea that one group holds sway over others, is starkly evident in this dystopian society. The upper classes, born with the privilege of awareness, do little to challenge the system, content to accept their station in life. The interactions between individuals, or rather the lack thereof, serve as a potent indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. Relationships are superficial, lacking depth or substance, as exemplified by the shallow comments of the male characters regarding women's physical appearance and the women's unapologetic descriptions of their experiences. The societal classes' complacency with their position in the hierarchy is a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, where individuals are conditioned to obey and conform, convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.\n\nIn this bleak world, love and genuine emotions are anathema, replaced by a stultifying superficiality. The characters' interactions are a far cry from the rich tapestry of human experience, reduced to shallow transactions and fleeting encounters. Huxley's Brave New World serves as a warning, a dire prophecy of a future where technology and capitalism converge to deprive humanity of its free will and emotional expression. The novel's bleak vision serves as a clarion call, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the dehumanizing effects of a system that values consumption over connection.",
            "Four years spent within these walls, a fractured landscape of stone and steel. It is a place where feet move with purpose, where paths converge and diverge like the arteries of a great, sprawling beast. And yet, in this labyrinthine sprawl, the journey from one point to another can be a Sisyphean task. I have known this struggle, traversing the distance from East Halls to Willard building, a trek that once took up to a quarter hour on foot, and longer still in the rain. The elements, a capricious mistress, can turn even the shortest path into an odyssey.\n\nI recall a conversation with an alumnus, a man not much older than myself, who spoke of the campus as it once was – a place where the East Halls stood apart, shrouded in a sea of vacant land. But time, that great clarifier, has seen the transformation of this desolate expanse into a tapestry of sports fields, modern edifices, and apartments. As the campus continues to expand, so too does the difficulty of navigating its twists and turns. In this regard, the bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a mode of transportation both efficient and elegant. Yet, it is not merely a matter of possessing a bike; it is a question of cultivating a culture that values the pedestrian and the cyclist.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after a long hiatus, and his words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The bicycle is not merely a mode of transportation; it is a way of life, a means of connecting with the world around us. And, like many of my peers, I have come to realize that it is the key to unlocking the secrets of this campus. From my home off-campus, a place not dissimilar from some of the dorms, I could walk to Thomas building in a quarter hour or more. But with a bike, the journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a fraction of the time I would spend on foot. The road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is a challenge, a serpentine path that winds through the heart of the campus. It is a route that requires patience, a path that tests one's resolve.\n\nAnd yet, I would not trade it for the world. For in the rhythm of the pedals, I find a sense of freedom, a sense of purpose. The bicycle is not merely a tool; it is an extension of the self, a means of navigating the complexities of this campus. It is a reminder that even in the most seemingly insurmountable challenges, there is always a way forward, always a path that winds its way through the darkness. And so, I will continue to ride, to pedal through the twists and turns of this campus, ever seeking the beauty that lies just beyond the horizon."
