            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, a beacon of hope for the forsaken and the oppressed. My intention is to walk the treacherous terrain of social work, to navigate the labyrinthine paths of the abused and the neglected, and to provide solace to the troubled families that have been ravaged by the tempests of life. The values that animate my pursuit are service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the betterment of relationships and the self.\n\nIn the wasteland of uncertainty, I have often found myself lost, unsure of the path that lay ahead. Yet, it was the specter of human suffering that beckoned me, a siren's call to a life of purpose. As I traversed the barren expanse of high school and college, I witnessed the syphoning of hope from the lives of those around me. Many fled from their problems, abandoning all semblance of stability, while others clung to coping mechanisms that were little more than a veneer of despair. It was in this desolate landscape that I found my calling, a Bachelor's degree in Psychology a paltry shield against the incoming tide of human suffering.\n\nThe summer of 2009, a season of reflection, found me at a crossroads. It was then that I encountered a young boy, sixteen years old and adrift in a sea of turmoil. His story was a litany of pain, a testament to the ravages of abuse and neglect. It was in that moment that I knew my path was set, that I would walk the treacherous roads of social work, armed with nothing but a degree in Psychology and a burning desire to make a difference.\n\nThe parents, two figures shrouded in a veil of deceit, seemed to mock the very idea of help. Their words, a jarring cacophony of excuses and justifications, fell upon me like a cold wind. And yet, I knew that I had to act, to intervene in the dance of denial that had become their lives. I spoke to the police, a hesitant voice in the darkness, and offered what little knowledge I possessed. The outcome was uncertain, but I knew that I had taken the first step on a long and arduous journey.\n\nSocial justice, a concept that has haunted me since my formative years, is the fire that burns within me. A society that claims to value individuality yet seeks to suffocate it beneath a sea of conformity is a paradox that I find unbearable. I have walked this tightrope, a tightrope of self-expression and nonconformity, ever since I was a child. I have worn my hair in unnatural hues, worn clothing that defied the norms, pierced my ears in a gesture of defiance, and spoken out against the injustices that I have witnessed. And I will continue to do so, for it is in the pursuit of social justice that I find my purpose.\n\nIn the end, it is not the destination that matters, but the journey itself. It is the darkness that we face, the uncertainty that we must navigate, that shapes us into the individuals we are meant to be. And it is in the face of this uncertainty that I find solace, a solace that will guide me on my path as a social worker, a path that is fraught with peril, but one that I am willing to walk.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human condition, sleep disorders cast long shadows over the lives of countless individuals. Insomnia, a specter that haunts the minds of many, is a disorder that has been shrouded in mystery. The Biological and Sociocultural models attempt to unravel the threads that bind this enigma, each offering a unique perspective on the complexities of this affliction. This paper will delve into the recesses of these models, illuminating the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of insomnia.\n\nThe Biological model, a labyrinth of intricacies, navigates the treacherous waters of genetics and physiology. Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny sentinels of the brain, contain orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate dance of sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons hold the key to understanding the sleep-wake states of an individual. The activation of these receptors, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces a somnambulant response, while their inhibition, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, reduces anxiety and induces slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been found to increase sleep time in animal models, a discovery that hints at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. A problem or absence with this receptor, a crack in the edifice of sleep, can alter the ability to slumber without medication, leaving the individual adrift in a sea of wakefulness.\n\nThe Sociocultural model, a tapestry woven from the threads of environmental relationships, offers a broader perspective on insomnia. It examines the intersections of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, each a unique strand in the intricate web of factors that contribute to this disorder. The inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor, a genetic predisposition, can regulate sleep, and an alteration of this receptor can naturally disturb sleep, impacting aspects of life that require focus and attention. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nThe research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the complexities of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of primary sleep disorders, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Each of these disorders, a unique facet of the sleep-wake spectrum, offers a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of insomnia. The Parasomnias, a category of sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, add another layer to the tapestry of insomnia, a reminder that this disorder is not solely a product of biology, but also of the complex interplay between environment and genetics.\n\nThe research of Matsuki et al. (2009) offers a nuanced understanding of the GABAB receptor and its role in sleep regulation. The study's findings, a testament to the power of science, suggest that the activation of this receptor induces sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces somnolence. The implications of this research are far-reaching, hinting at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. This understanding can shed light on the etiology of insomnia, a disorder that has long been shrouded in mystery.\n\nHowever, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations. The study's focus on animal models, a narrow lens through which to view the complexities of human sleep, raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. The sociocultural implications of the study, a reminder that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor can regulate sleep, are also worthy of consideration. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nIn conclusion, the Biological and Sociocultural models offer a nuanced understanding of insomnia, a disorder that is both multifaceted and complex. The research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the intricacies of this affliction, and the findings of Matsuki et al. (2009) offer a glimpse into the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. However, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations, and a more comprehensive understanding of insomnia will require a broader examination of the interplay between biology and environment.",

This is Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a malady that besets the central nervous system, rendering it incapable of processing the auditory world with the clarity and precision it demands. Like a desert wind that withers the trees, CAPD robs its victims of the ability to discern the subtleties of sound, leaving them lost and adrift in a sea of cacophony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first stumbled upon the concept of \"auditory imperception.\" Like a faint echo, it was a notion that lingered in the shadows, waiting to be fleshed out by the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954. Their pioneering work laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the disorder, and it was not until 1961 that Kimura introduced the concept of dichotic testing, a method that would allow researchers to peer into the very workings of the brain's auditory processing machinery.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in a multitude of ways, each one a bitter reminder of the disorder's insidious power. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, as if the very notion of spatial awareness has been lost on them. They may falter in distinguishing between two or more acoustic events, their minds unable to discern the subtleties of sound. The patterns of speech, once a reliable guidepost, now become a jumbled mess of confusion. And the sequence of sounds, once a logical progression, becomes a maddening puzzle.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and doubt. The process involves a systematic observation of listening behavior, a painstaking examination of the patient's auditory function, and a series of tests designed to push the limits of their processing abilities. Like a desert wanderer searching for an oasis, the clinician must navigate a labyrinthine maze of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations, all in the hope of uncovering the hidden truth. There is no single, foolproof test, no silver bullet that can guarantee a diagnosis. The disorder remains a mystery, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and deceives.\n\nYet, even in the face of uncertainty, there is hope. A teacher, armed with knowledge and compassion, can be a beacon of light in the darkness. By understanding the subtleties of CAPD, they can create an environment that is supportive and inclusive, a haven where the afflicted can learn to navigate the complexities of the auditory world. It is a challenge, yes, but one that can be met with patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the disorder's insidious power.\n\nIn the end, it is not the disorder that defines us, but our response to it. Like the desert itself, CAPD is a harsh and unforgiving environment, but it is one that can be navigated, one that can be overcome. And it is in this knowledge that we find hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness that guides us forward, ever forward, into the unknown.",
            "The artificial masquerade of Twelfth Night poses a dire question: can one ever truly shed the skin of deception, or are we forever bound to the guises we've assumed? The play's exploration of disguise reveals a bitter truth: the art of deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting us free from the shackles of our true selves, yet ensnaring us in a labyrinth of alienation and disconnection.\n\nIn the fleeting world of the theater, Viola's ruse as Cesario serves as a fragile bulwark against the cruelties of a foreign land. Yet, this calculated stratagem exacts a terrible toll, severing her ties to the women who might have offered her solace and support. Her impersonation becomes so convincing that it beguiles even the lovesick Olivia, who sees in Cesario a reflection of her own desires, rather than the truth of Viola's own heart.\n\nAs the play unfolds, the masks of identity begin to slip, revealing the tangled web of suppressed emotions that lies beneath. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario may be a jest, a satire of the societal norms that reduce people to shallow facades. Her sudden switch to Sebastian, however, hints at a more profound truth: that true love knows no bounds, nor is bound by the strictures of societal expectation. \n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: can we ever truly shed the disguises we've worn, or are we forever trapped in a hall of mirrors, reflecting back at us the distortions of our own making? The characters of Olivia and Orsino, caught in the whirlpool of their own desires, seem to suggest that sometimes the only way to break free is to confront the shadows that lie within.\n\nIn this harsh world of masquerade and deception, we are forced to confront the darkness within ourselves, and the price we pay for the disguises we wear. The play's exploration of this theme serves as a reminder that our true selves are forever hidden, like a vein of coal in the earth, waiting to be unearthed by the rocky tides of experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the colonial landscape, a tale of contrasts unfolds. The German colonial empire, a behemoth of brutality and exploitation, left an indelible mark on the nations it claimed. The genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa stands as a gruesome testament to the empire's unyielding ferocity. Yet, this is but a single thread in the complex tapestry of German colonial rule, a story woven from diverse policies, governing styles, and geography.\n\nThe educational provision across the colonies mirrors the empire's multifaceted nature. In East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of educated and literate Africans, a legacy of German efforts that earned praise from contemporary observers. In contrast, South West Africa presented a stark picture of neglect, where the task of native education fell to missionary societies, coddled by the government's limited support. Simultaneously, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, haunting South West Africa long after the empire's collapse.\n\nThe divergent experiences of the German colonies can be attributed to a constellation of social, political, and economic factors. This paper seeks to illuminate these influences, casting a spotlight on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. A rich literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, mostly penned in German and composed during or shortly after the period of colonial rule. These early works aimed to catalog the features of educational systems, while later English-language studies delved deeper, conducting comparative analyses and probing specific aspects of education. The seminal work of Cohen stands as a benchmark, dissecting the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, and pinpointing the large settler population as a key factor driving the differences between them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of arid desert and temperate oases, boasted a European population of nearly 15,000 by 1913, dwarfing the settler population of East Africa. This demographic disparity had profound implications for the colony's educational landscape, as evidenced by Cohen's study. In the shadows of the colonial edifice, the voices of the native Africans remain silenced, their experiences and perspectives lost to the annals of history. This narrative, though, offers a glimpse into the labyrinthine corridors of the colonial psyche, illuminating the dark recesses of a bygone era, where the shadows of oppression continue to linger.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the landscape of popular music has undergone a metamorphosis, a morass of genres that defy classification. Like a barren wasteland, the terrain is pockmarked with the remnants of bygone eras, each one a testament to the transience of sound. The behemoth that is Heavy Metal, a leviathan of a genre, has sprawled across the musical tapestry, its tendrils reaching into the very depths of the human experience.\n\nWithin this behemoth, a labyrinth of sub and sub-sub genres has spawned, each one a reflection of the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A darkness that is at once a manifestation of the human condition, and a reflection of the primal fears that lurk within us all. It is a darkness that is expressed through the cathartic release of sound, a symphony of rage and despair that echoes through the void.\n\nAnd yet, despite the diversity that has come to define Heavy Metal, there is a unifying thread that runs through it all - the thread of darkness. A darkness that is not just a reflection of the music itself, but a reflection of the world in which we live. A world that is beset on all sides by the ravages of time, a world that is slowly succumbing to the entropy that is inherent in all things.\n\nIt is a world that is reflected in the lyrics of the damned, the ravings of the tormented, and the screams of the desperate. A world that is captured in the swirling vortex of sound that is Heavy Metal, a world that is both beautiful and ugly, a world that is both a reflection of ourselves, and a reflection of our place in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of musical innovation, were among the first to tap into this wellspring of darkness, their song Helter Skelter a paean to the chaos that lies at the heart of human experience. A song that is both a reflection of the turmoil that ravages our souls, and a reflection of the resilience that allows us to carry on in the face of adversity.\n\nLike the first tentative steps into the unknown, the creation of Heavy Metal was a journey into the very heart of darkness. A journey that has taken us to the very limits of human endurance, and beyond. A journey that has left us scarred, bruised, and forever changed. And yet, it is a journey that we continue to embark upon, a journey that is both a testament to our resilience, and a reflection of our own mortality.",
            "In a world that slumbered beyond the veils of sanity, a man with a brush born of dreams conjured forth visions on canvas. Henri Rousseau, a name etched in the annals of time, toiled in obscurity, his heart afire with the passion of creation. The Dream, a 1910 tapestry woven from the very fabric of his being, revealed not only a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, but also the artist's own tortured struggle to find acceptance in a world that shunned the unconventional.\n\nAs the moon cast its silvery glow upon the rolling hills of northwest France, where Rousseau's own life's canvas was set to unfurl, the seeds of his destiny were sown. Born on a fateful day in May, 1844, the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, Rousseau's early life was a tapestry of ordinary toil and quiet desperation. The call of art, however, beckoned, and he heeded the siren's song, though his formal training was but a distant memory, lost in the mists of time. The title of douanier, a customs inspector, clung to him like a shroud, a badge of a life unlived.\n\nThe passing of his first wife, Clémence, and the silent departure of eight infant children left Rousseau with but a single daughter, Julia, and a void that could not be filled. In the face of such desolation, he turned to the brush, a refuge from the abyss that yawned before him. Unlike his contemporaries, who saw the peasant as a symbol of rustic charm, Rousseau saw himself in their midst, a folk painter, driven by the hopes and fears of the common man.\n\nThe weight of his unfulfilled dreams pressed upon him like a physical force, a constant reminder that he was but a novice in a world of masters. The likes of Matisse, with his revolutionary style, eclipsed Rousseau, a painter of convention, whose very ambition was to be accepted by the art world. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the two men were poles apart, their reasons for painting as disparate as the stars in a midnight sky: Matisse, driven by a terror of the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint with such banality that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau bared his soul, a canvas of longing, of the struggle to balance the desire for recognition with the need to remain true to oneself. A world of dreams and reality blurred, as the artist's inner demons wrestled with the external world, a battleground where the lines between truth and art were forever blurred. And so, in the Dream, we see not only a woman lost in a mystical realm, but the very essence of Rousseau's being, a man torn asunder by the conflicting desires of his heart and mind.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread weaves its way through the tapestry of ethics and aesthetics, a subtle yet unbreakable bond between truth and beauty. It is a notion that has been pondered by the greatest minds, a notion that transcends the confines of education and experience. As the poet John Keats so eloquently puts it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is as if the essence of morality and art is an unspoken language, one that resonates within us, yet defies the constraints of words.\n\nWe grapple with the complexities of what is good and beautiful, but our attempts to pin down these concepts fall short. They elude us like a will-o'-the-wisp, always just out of reach. Our analyses of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa may revolve around concepts like foreground and background, but ultimately, these are mere descriptions, not the source of its beauty. When asked to explain the power of a favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to vague phrases like \"There's just something about it.\" This is because, as the writer Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nSimilarly, ethics defies reduction to a set of rules or principles. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendent quality, this unnamable \"je ne sais quoi,\" that binds ethics and aesthetics together. This intangible connection is what makes art and morality so powerful, so resonant.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is beyond the reaches of language, a level that is noumenal, to use the Kantian term. This is where the impact of art and morality is felt most profoundly, in the depths of our being. And nowhere is this connection more evident than in literature, where the moral quality is an integral part of its very essence. As is said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the depths of a land forsaken, where the Alps stood sentinel and the Baltic sea lapped against the shores, a nation arose, forged from the crucible of a thousand cultures. The Germany of today stands as a testament to this incongruity, a land of contrasts, where the shadows of the past linger, and the ghosts of empires past whisper through the valleys. From the storied city of München, where the Alps cradle the heart of the nation, to the wind-swept shores of the Baltic, where the grey sea meets the grey skies, the German spirit is a tapestry woven from threads of disparate cultures, a testament to the resilience of a people forged in the fire of adversity.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" is a whispered secret, shrouded in the mists of time, its origins disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a voice from the past, claimed that the name arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, their name a reminder of the tumultuous battles they fought against the Gaulish forces. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, a conqueror of lands and a chronicler of the human spirit, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, a testament to the clash of civilizations that shaped the fate of a continent. He took the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered and the unconquered, the defeated and the defiant.\n\nAs the years passed, the question of the name's origin persisted, a mystery that refused to yield to the passage of time. Some posited that it referred to the spear, the \"ger\" that the Germanic warriors wielded in battle, a symbol of their unyielding resolve. Others suggested that it came from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that captured the essence of the Germanic people, their voices raised in defiance, their spirits unbroken. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the cold light of the first century, penned a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Germans, a people who dwelled in a land of wild beauty, where the skies were unforgiving and the people were unyielding. In his De Origine et situ Germanorum, he wrote of the Germans as a people apart, unbroken by the tides of history, their culture a testament to their enduring presence. Who would leave the warmth of Asia or Africa, the grandeur of Rome, for the wilds of Germania, unless it were their home, their heart's desire? (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so the Germanic tribes dwelled on the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a reminder of the empire's reach, their influence a testament to the power of a people unbroken by the forces of conquest. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their presence a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward, always a path to be forged.

            "I gazed down, a vacant expression etched on my face, my mind sifting through the scene before me like ashes in a gust of wind. The world was a vast, unbroken canvas, its colors muted and its texture rough, like the pockmarked skin of a long-forgotten land. My thoughts were a ceaseless flow, a river of comprehension that ebbed and flowed, never quite coalescing into anything tangible. It was as if I'd shed the burden of thought, leaving myself to drift on a tide of observation.\n\nYears ago, in a dimly lit room, I'd stumbled upon a book on drawing. It was a meager thing, a handful of lines and shapes, but it spoke to something deep within me. The author spoke of squares, of frames, of the way the mind can be tricked into seeing the world anew. I'd wanted to draw since I was a child, to capture the world in all its messy beauty. But it was more than that – it was a way to hold the world still, to pin it down like a butterfly on a pin. The artist's frame was a device, a tool to corral the chaos, to tame the unmanageable.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in time, I couldn't conjure the artist's square. The world was too vast, too overwhelming. I was lost in the depths of it, a small, insignificant speck, adrift in a sea of wonder. The masters – Picasso, Monet, the Italians – they'd all had their moments, their epiphanies. If I were to be an artist, if I were to leave my mark on the world, it had to start here, with this, the beginning of my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for the toilet handle, my thoughts a jumble of anxiety and frustration. Water swirled, a vortex of crystal clear water, and I was powerless to stop it. My hand jerked, spasmed, and struck the handle again, but the package remained, stubborn and unyielding, a mocking presence in the midst of my creative crucible.\n\nI stood there, a man lost in a world of his own making, a world of brown and beige and dull, unyielding matter. My grip on the mop tightened, my feet planted firmly on the ground, as I gazed upon the offending bundle. A few more minutes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved, slow and deliberate, towards the wall, towards the toilet paper, towards the ultimate act of creation. I was a sculptor, a master of the mundane, and this was my masterpiece.\n\nAs I dipped my hand into the bowl, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of purpose. This was art, this was creation, and I was its master. And for a moment, in that moment, I was free.",
            "In the twilight of lives, when the morrow's dawn still clings to the horizon like a shroud, a specter stalks the roads, a harbinger of death. Teenagers, blinded by the siren song of freedom, their eyes locked on the horizon, their hearts afire with a reckless abandon, behind the wheel, their very inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the unsuspecting world. The statistics are stark, a grim testament to the carnage they sow: the National Institutes of Health reveal a truth that should shake the very foundations of our collective conscience – the teenage brain, still unfolding like a lotus flower, is not yet ready to navigate the treacherous waters of driving.\n\nInexperience, a woeful lack of wisdom, and a propensity for the thrill of the unknown, a maelstrom of factors that conspire against the young and the innocent. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has sounded the alarm, its findings a clarion call to action: the age of the passenger is directly correlated to the number of accidents on the road. The correlation is a noose, tightening around the neck of our youth, a noose that can be loosened only by a concerted effort to address the root cause of this scourge.\n\nThe provisional driver's licenses, a Band-Aid solution, a temporary fix for a problem that runs far deeper. We are fooling ourselves, deluding ourselves into thinking that by restricting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers, we are somehow mitigating the risks. But we are not. The issue is not the license, it is the individual, the young driver, still a leaf blown about by the winds of whim and folly.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage of the human psyche, has warned us of the dangers of issuing driver's licenses to those under the age of 19-20. His research speaks of a primal urge, a desire to take risks for the sheer exhilaration of it all. We are tempting fate, tempting the gods, by allowing these young drivers to take the wheel. We are courting disaster, inviting the specter of death to join us on the roads.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not revolutionary, merely a return to sanity, a recognition of the fact that our young drivers are not yet ready for the responsibilities that come with the keys to a car. Schools can continue to provide the educational foundation, but until the age of 18, the roads must remain closed to them. A provisional permit can still be issued, but only after a rigorous training program, one that includes a minimum of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. This is not a novel idea, merely a common-sense solution to a problem that has been festering for far too long.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better. The lives of our young people depend on it. The ghosts of the road, the specter of death, will not be silenced until we take action. We must act, we must legislate, and we must protect our youth from the dangers that lurk on the roads, dangers that are as much a product of their own inexperience as they are of our own negligence.",
            "Deep within the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's labyrinthine repository of early Edison films, I chanced upon a cache of trick films, fifteen in total, from the halcyon days of 1895 to the nascent years of 1901. These cinematic conjurings, forged in the crucible of creative editing, danced on the precipice of illusion, their poetics waiting to be unraveled like a skein of unraveling thread. My foray into the world of trick films centered on dissecting the underlying principles that governed the majority of these enigmatic motion pictures, while also tracing the evolutionary divergences that distinguished a select few of the later entries.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the heart of the trick film, I discovered a prevailing aesthetic that bound these early cinematic endeavors together. Like a prisoner confined to a narrow cell, the trick film was set-bound, its compositional parameters defined by the strictures of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained rooted in its appointed position, unmoving and unyielding, as if bound to the very spot where the story unfolded. The resulting films, bereft of camera movement, relied on the steadfastness of the proscenium to conjure the illusion of drama and narrative. The adherence to long and medium shots, a direct descendant of the stage and vaudeville traditions, further underscored the static nature of the trick film.\n\nYet, as the years ticked by, a nascent sense of experimentation began to seep into the fabric of trick films. A few bold spirits, unencumbered by the strictures of convention, dared to challenge the status quo by introducing innovations such as multiple shots. Like a glimmer of light piercing the darkness, these new techniques hinted at a world beyond the narrow confines of the proscenium.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the trick films, a thread that wove its way through the entirety of the Edison catalog, was their penchant for filming within the confines of an interior set. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained fixed in its proscenium position, a static sentinel guarding the unfolding drama. This composition, born of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, imposed a strict limitation on the movement of figures within the frame. Like puppets on a string, the actors were confined to a narrow axis, their movements restricted to the horizontal plane. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) served as a prime example of this phenomenon, its actors entering from the right side and moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, their exit from the frame occurring without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated the shot length of these early trick films. Like a metronome marking time, the shots tended to be long and, on occasion, medium shots. Close-ups, a staple of modern cinema, were an anomaly in the trick films, their absence a testament to the stage and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, confined to the middle ground, remained steadfast, their faces and actions frozen in time, unmoving and unyielding, like statues in a garden of stone.\n\nThe trick films, bound by the strictures of their one-shot-per-film methodology, were limited in length, their narrative and dramatic potential curtailed by the constraints of their compositional format. Most trick films, akin to vaudeville acts, focused on short, attention-grabbing tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, bereft of narrative depth or dramatic complexity. Yet, even within these limitations, a few trick films, like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), revealed a more nuanced understanding of the medium, their physical shots joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance, a testament to the evolving art of the trick film.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of his mind, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a steadfast sentinel, his convictions a bulwark against the tempests of a world gone mad. A farmer by trade, a politician by chance, he had dedicated his life to the unfettered pursuit of personal freedom and the sanctity of government. The agrarian ideals that had guided his plow had become the lodestar of his life, illuminating the dark recesses of his soul and illuminating the path to a system of government that would preserve the sacred rights of man.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the fetters of tradition, Taylor saw an opportunity to forge a new nation, one where the virtuous and the vicious alike would be tempered by the fire of self-governance. He believed that the natural rights of man, like the seasons, were interdependent – that the denial of one would sow the seeds of discord and wither the harvest of the rest. These rights, like the unyielding roots of a tree, must be shielded from the grasping hands of government.\n\nTaylor's vision was one of a dualistic world, where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were locked in an eternal struggle. He saw government as a reflection of this duality, its virtues and vices born of the same flawed humanity that governed it. A government, he believed, must be founded on the principles of private property, agricultural prosperity, and the curtailment of avarice. Only thus could it ensure that the self-interest that drove humanity would not be the sole arbiter of its actions, but rather a force tempered by the public good.\n\nLike a stubborn oak, Taylor stood firm in his conviction that the Constitution must be interpreted with a strict hand, its words a sacred text that must be read with the intent of its authors in mind. He knew that a government with too much power was like a raging fire, devouring all in its path, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was a recipe for disaster. The Declaration of Independence, with its ringing words of sovereignty and liberty, was to him the true charter of the United States, a beacon that guided him through the treacherous waters of his time.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project - a decline as precipitous as the grey slope of a winter's hill. It was a disheartening turn, a shadow that crept over the landscape of our initiative like a chill wind. The reasons for this downturn were as elusive as the mist that rose from the frozen earth. Perhaps the winter's grip on the campus had begun to tighten, trapping some beneath its icy grip, forcing them to abandon their bicycles and their feet, to succumb to the convenience of wheels and the warmth of their cars. Or maybe the weight of semester's end, the crushing pressure to finish, to grade, to flee, had obscured the log from their minds, a small but vital task lost in the whirlwind of the season. And of course, the holidays, those times of feasting and forgetting, had brought a halt to the project's momentum, as if the very mention of it had been stricken from the collective memory. But December's passing, and January's chill, and still the logs remained sparse, a puzzle that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, we sought to rekindle the flame, to reanimate the initiative. We conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting but fiery spark that flared to life in March, casting a brief but warm glow over our efforts. And lo, the logs began to flow once more, like the gentle thawing of a winter's night. But the question remained: how to sustain this momentum, to keep the project from succumbing to the same forces that had brought it low. For in this world, where freedom and independence and flexibility were the watchwords, where the siren's call of the car was ever-present, it seemed a Sisyphean task to persuade people to abandon their wheels for the uncertain pleasures of alternative transportation.\n\nWe offered incentives, tokens of our appreciation, in the form of gift certificates to the local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores. But were they enough? Would the promise of a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle have been enough to stir the hearts of our commuters, to rouse them from their torpor? We may never know, for the prizes remained constant throughout the project's duration. But it is a tantalizing prospect, a what-if that haunts us still. What if we had announced, in December, the addition of a bicycle, and in January, a hybrid car? Would the logs have flowed more freely, the project's momentum uninterrupted by the hurdles of the holiday season and the semester's end? We can only speculate, lost in the mists of what might have been.",
            "In the desolate expanse of financial markets, a peculiar creature lurked, its essence distilled in the form of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. This creature, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, seemed to embody the very essence of flexibility, trading with the ephemeral ease of a stock on an exchange. It offered the diversification of an index fund and the singular allure of single stock ownership, a siren's call to investors seeking the best of both worlds.\n\nYet, as with all creatures, there existed a price to be paid. The expense ratios of these ETFs, though lower than those of their mutual fund brethren, were a reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can be a double-edged sword. The need to pay a commission on each transaction, a fee that hung over the investor like a specter, served as a constant reminder of the ETF's existence.\n\nLike a wilderness, the ETF IHF sprawled before us, its top 10 holdings a testament to its power and complexity. To navigate this labyrinth, we narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which comprised 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These 10, a subset of the whole, seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's inner workings.\n\nBut to truly comprehend the ETF, we must delve deeper, into the realm of Beta and return. Like the twisting paths of a forestry, the Beta and return calculations wove a complex tapestry, one that revealed a startling truth: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return, a 16% increase, with a Beta that was 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. The siren's call of the ETF, it seemed, was not without its drawbacks.\n\nYet, like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies. The possibility of statistical significance hung over the results like a specter, a reminder that even the most compelling of arguments can be fleeting. To pierce the veil of uncertainty, we turned to the standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's volatility.\n\nThe standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's inner turmoil, hung like a shadow over the results. Normalized to 100%, the accumulated standard deviation of the top 10 stocks seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's fundamental nature. Like the rustling of leaves in an autumnal wind, the results seemed to suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might be the key to unlocking the ETF's true potential.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of financial markets, the ETF IHF remained an enigma, a creature of mystery and intrigue. Its top 10 holdings, a subset of the whole, seemed to hold the key to understanding the ETF's inner workings. But like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies, leaving the question: can a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings truly provide a higher return with a lower Beta?

            "As if conjured from the darkest recesses of the mind, Dream-Land stood as one of Edgar Allan Poe's most celebrated creations. Yet, it was in the forgotten shards of this work that a hidden thread of influence lay concealed, woven from the very fabric of a bygone era. In lines 6 and 56, Poe wove the enigmatic tapestry of \"Thulé\", a term whose origins unfold like a fable, reaching back to the ancient Virgil. But, like a ghostly presence, it was not the Roman poet alone who bore responsibility for this enigmatic term. Poe's fascination with the German masters, particularly Goethe, lay at the heart of this mystique.\n\nA whispered legacy of influence, Poe's debt to Goethe's works was one that would be echoed by scholars for years to come. Karl J. Arndt, in his erudite tome, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, would unravel the tangled threads of their poetic kinship, leaving no doubt as to the deliberate echoes of the German master. It was as if Poe had set out to craft a dark and twisted doppelganger, a shadowy reflection of Goethe's own creations.\n\nIt was in the somber realm of Faust, that grand and tragic drama penned by Goethe, that the poet would find the seeds of his own \"Thule\". The King of Thule, a poem woven into the fabric of Faust's second part, spoke of a monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his queen, drinking away the bitter memories of their love. As the king's world crumbled, he surrendered to the void, his legacy reduced to the solitary goblet, a potent symbol of his devastation. And so, like a ghostly specter, the King of Thulé haunted the pages of Poe's Dream-Land, a poignant testament to the poet's own struggles with loss and the allure of the abyss.\n\nIn the collected works of Poe, the term \"Thulé\" would reappear, like a recurring nightmare, a haunting refrain that whispered secrets of a world beyond the veil. As in The Pit and the Pendulum, Poe would invoke the echoes of Goethe's creation, weaving a dark and foreboding tapestry of shadows and despair. And in the depths of this abyss, the two poets would meet, their visions entwined like the branches of two twisted trees, their darkness amplified by the silence of the night.\n\nAs Poe navigated the labyrinthine paths of his own creative subconscious, he would find himself drawn to the somber landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where shadows reigned supreme, and the colors of life had long since faded away. In this desolate realm, the speaker of Dream-Land wandered, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, his world shrouded in a perpetual twilight, devoid of hope or solace. It was as if Poe had taken up the mantle of the King of Thulé, his own demons driving him forward, through the treacherous landscape of his own broken heart.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of literary history, Poe and Goethe would meet, their works entwined like the roots of two ancient trees, their darkness and despair a testament to the power of the human imagination. As the ages passed, their legacy would endure, a haunting reminder of the power of art to capture the very essence of our darkest fears and deepest longings. And in the end, it was not the light of knowledge that would guide us, but the shadows of our own lost souls, forever bound to the dark and twisted world of the imagination.",
            "In the court of California, a query arises as to whether a customer, injured by the fall from an applesauce spill in a grocery store, can claim punitive damages from the store's manager, who, after being informed twice of the spill, chose to delay cleaning it for thirty minutes while partaking in a dinner break. A judge, in weighing the merits of this claim, would likely not dismiss it outright. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were motivated by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from their conduct. Moreover, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were despicable, meaning reprehensible and lacking in moral fiber. Jennifer Palmer, the plaintiff in this case, can argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have been aware of the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple instances of slips and falls that had occurred at the store in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose to ignore the hazard, opting instead to enjoy his dinner.\n\nThe plaintiff's contention that Martin's actions were despicable may not be as convincing, yet it remains a reasonable argument, given the recurring slip-and-fall incidents that had plagued the store in 2009, including six reported incidents prior to Palmer's accident. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the spill to Martin's attention, to which he replied with the same dismissive attitude. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of the situation became apparent. \n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were motivated by oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, actions that are despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately chose to ignore them.

            "In the stillness that follows the passage of time, I find myself wandering back to a course I once took on the subject of Islam at CBC.  The fervor of debate that coursed through those discussions still echoes within me.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion continues to gnaw at my mind, its relevance sharpened by the events that have transpired since that fateful day in 2001.  I recall how the media's gaze shifted, like a desert sun, from a harsh scrutiny of Islam to an almost perverse tolerance, a tolerance that was as unyielding as the desert sands.  And yet, in that same era, a figure emerged, a man named Barack Obama, whose family's ties to Islam seemed to hold no significance in the minds of the masses.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, its contradictions a puzzle that refuses to be solved.  The man I thought I knew, the man of fire and steel, who conquered and claimed dominion over tribes, seems to have been supplanted by a figure of quiet humility.  A man who, according to the biography, was a martyr, misunderstood and humbled by the will of others.  And yet, it was this very same man who drew people to him, one by one, as the truth of his words and deeds became clear.  The similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad are striking, but it is the manner in which they are presented that troubles me.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that echoes the bounty of Jesus' own miracles, seems less a demonstration of power and more a testament to Muhammad's willingness to serve.  This is a narrative that belies the truth, for it reduces the grandeur of Jesus' life and teachings to a mere echo of Muhammad's.\n\nThe stories that make up the biography are a tangled web of hearsay and second-hand accounts, each one a thread that weaves a fragile tapestry of truth.  The authors' intention, to provide proof of the 'witness' of Muhammad's message, only serves to undermine the very fabric of the stories themselves.  The further removed from the source, the more suspect the narrative becomes, a fragile reed that bends in the wind of doubt.\n\nBut it is not the stories that bother me most, it is the way in which they seek to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a godly man, humble and wise.  History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of power and ambition, of a man who rose to greatness through force and guile.  And so, I am left to wonder, what do Muslims today know of the truth behind Muhammad's ascension to power?  Does the myth of the humble prophet blind them to the reality of the man who forged their faith?",
            "In the tumultuous expanse of time, a great divergence unfolded, like the gradual darkening of a winter's sky. The teachings of Jesus, born of the earth and the spirit, were soon lost to the ambitious undertow of Christian thought. As the years ebbed and flowed, a tide of doctrine rose, obscuring the original intention of the faith. It was as if the very voice of the divine had been muffled by the murmur of dogma and tradition.\n\nIn the broad sweep of history, a trend became apparent – one of Christianity drifting ever further from its source. The world, it seemed, was moving in a direction opposite to its own. The stalwart and the unwavering, those who clung to the familiar and the known, would resist the tides of change. Yet, their collective voice, though loud, would prove insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nA new awareness, a yearning for the authentic, would stir in the hearts of many. They would seek to peel away the layers of doctrine, to return to the unadorned truth of Jesus' words. This was a process that would take time, perhaps centuries, but it was inevitable. The clock of history would turn backward, and the religion would be reclaimed from the hands of those who had transformed it into a labyrinth of dogma.\n\nAs the trend swept through the lands of the United States and Europe, a profound transformation would unfold. The people would return to the simplicity of Jesus' teachings, unencumbered by the weight of tradition. The once-diverse and fragmented Christian world would become increasingly uniform, like the smooth expanse of a lake on a windless day.\n\nHuman history was replete with examples of such reversals. The once-persecuted Christians, shunned and slaughtered by the Roman Empire, would one day claim dominion over it. The nation, born of slavery, would rise to leadership. And so, too, would the Christian faith, shedding its accumulated layers of doctrine, return to its source.\n\nA crucial aspect of this reversal would be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphor, rather than literal truth. Only by stripping away the encrustations of time and tradition could the essence of the faith be revealed.\n\nLooking back into the depths of history, we find the theological foundation of Christianity – Judaism. The Hebrew scriptures, the perception of a single, divine authority, and the monotheistic creed – all these were in place long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem. Yet, even within Judaism, there was no singular spirit. The people were fractured, divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "The depths of human nature, like a stagnant pool, reveal the stark truth of our kind: a relentless pursuit of self-aggrandizement, a covetousness that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a scathing exposé by Upton Sinclair, lays bare the putrid underbelly of our species, where the baser instincts of greed and avarice hold sway. The masters of industry, those self-proclaimed titans of progress, care not a whit for the ravaged earth, the suffering masses, or the unspeakable indignities inflicted upon them. Theirs is a calculus of profit and loss, a ledger that reckons the worth of human life in the penny-pinching language of the bottom line.\n\nAs Sinclair bares the anatomy of Packingtown, we behold the hideous visage of our own depravity: the factories, those steel monoliths that belch forth their noxious fumes into the very air we breathe, leave in their wake a trail of desolation, a scarred and barren landscape that cries out for redemption. The proprietors and managers, those latter-day Philistines, regard the world with all the compassion of a winter's night, cold, unforgiving, and devoid of mercy.\n\nTheir employees, those toiling masses, are but mere cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and expendable, their lives reduced to a mere statistic in the ledger of progress. The hours are long, the toil is backbreaking, and the pay is meager, but the owners care not a whit, for they are the ones who reap the benefits of their sweat and toil. The unions, those supposed champions of the working class, prove to be little more than parasites, preying upon the very workers they claim to represent.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the stark realization that, in the end, we are not much better than slaves, our lives bound to the whims of those who would exploit us for their own gain. The Jungle is a cold, unforgiving mirror held up to our faces, a reminder that, deep down, we are all but beasts, driven by our baser instincts, our humanity reduced to naught but a distant memory, lost in the black smoke that chokes our cities and our souls.",
            "In the realm of literary craftsmanship, authors employ a multitude of techniques to inscribe their readers with a particular sentiment or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these methods prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, wields a plethora of these techniques with deft precision. He often pairs an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner, imbuing the subject with a certain aura. Sometimes, he assigns meaning to a symbol, only to utilize it for the same purpose with calculated effect. \n\nFitzgerald's utilization of colors is a striking example of this technique. He builds meaning for colors like white and gray, often pairing them together to convey a sense of uniformity. These colors take on a nuanced significance as the novel progresses, with Fitzgerald employing them to evoke a particular sentiment around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white with a sense of uniformity, and gray with a more aged and faded quality, is established early in the novel. He reinforces this meaning through repeated use of both colors in the narrative. The character of Daisy and her acquaintances are often described as \"in white,\" as if it were an inherent trait, a constant in their lives. Nick, too, wears \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, while Tom dons a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Even the landscape itself is not immune to these colors: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work. Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"gray name\" on Nick's timetable or a \"white girlhood\" shared by Jordan and Daisy.\n\nWith sufficient meaning assigned to these colors, Fitzgerald begins to employ them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding certain subjects. This technique is first applied to Daisy, whose appearance in a \"little white roadster\" after an extended absence from the narrative serves to render her a more uniform, less substantial character, a mere object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly to emphasize Daisy's role as a symbol of uniformity, as in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" or her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nIn this way, Fitzgerald masterfully employs color to craft a particular atmosphere around his characters and settings, subtly influencing the reader's perception of the narrative's themes and motifs. His use of white and gray serves as a testament to the power of language in shaping our understanding of the world, and the author's ability to wield this power with precision and effect.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, a land of sun-baked hills and verdant valleys, the earth yields its bounty with a generosity born of a mild and benevolent climate. Here, in the fertile crescent of the East County Southern Foothills, the landowner tills the rich soil, coaxing forth an abundance of succulent delights: plump tomatoes, luscious lemons, emerald greens, and the velvety softness of squash, broccoli, and herbs. The air is heavy with the sweet scent of ripening peaches and the delicate perfume of berries, while the gentle hum of bees as they tend to the honeycombs is a soothing serenade to the land.\n\nYet, in this Eden of plenty, there lies a paradox. Amidst the profusion of life, a fragility exists, a delicate balance that can be shattered by the careless hand. The landowner, aware of this fragility, seeks to walk the fine line between profit and preservation, aware that the allure of organic farming holds both promise and peril. The lure of government programs and lucrative markets beckons, yet the path of conventional farming beckons with its efficiency and scale, leaving the landowner to ponder the intricate dance between the needs of the land and the demands of the market.\n\nIn the scrubby landscape of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, the landowner's parcel of 160 acres stands as a testament to the region's storied past. Once home to the indigenous peoples who walked this land for untold centuries, it was later claimed by the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers of the late 1800s. The original homestead patent that deeded this land to its current steward holds secrets of a bygone era, whispers of a time when the land was a verdant tapestry of grazing lands and woodlots.\n\nIn this crucible of history and ecology, the landowner seeks to forge a new path, one that balances the needs of the market with the imperatives of the land. Drawing inspiration from the nearby Cleveland National Forest and the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the landowner strives to create a haven for the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as the burrowing owls whose numbers are dwindling. In this delicate web of life, the landowner seeks to find a harmony between profit and preservation, aware that the land itself holds the secrets to a sustainable future.\n\nWith each passing season, the landowner tends the land with care and devotion, aware that the gentle whispers of the past hold the key to a future of abundance and vitality. In this arid landscape, where the sun beats down and the soil thirsts for moisture, the landowner seeks to quench its thirst, to bring forth a verdant tapestry of life that will sustain generations to come.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, casting the land in a warm, golden light, the landowner knows that the land holds a secret: that the delicate balance between profit and preservation is not a zero-sum game, but a harmonious marriage of two opposing forces, each one enriching the other in a dance of life and death, of growth and decay. In this crucible of light and shadow, the landowner seeks to find the perfect balance, to create a haven of life in a world of scarcity, where the land itself holds the secrets to a future of abundance and vitality.",
            "The labyrinthine nature of culture lies at the core of any negotiation. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture defies homogeneity, its contours shifting like the sands of a forgotten hourglass. The broad strokes of generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" do little justice to the intricate complexities of a world where nothing is singular or uniform.\n\nWhen traversing the uncharted territories of a foreign culture, one cannot help but be drawn into the realm of the familiar, with comparisons forming like ripples on a still pond. To grasp the essence of a culture, one must delve into its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or altering, but of accepting it for what it is, and navigating its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high and the bargaining position tenuous.\n\nThe dichotomy of national and international cultures is a false one, for within the walls of any given nation, a multitude of corporate cultures thrives. A company's culture can be as stifling as it is liberating, with its own brand of tyranny or utopia. The signs are there, in the dress codes that dictate modesty or audacity, in the communication styles that prioritize directness or subtlety, and in the hiring practices that value talent or pedigree. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork quilt, with companies weaving their own unique narratives from threadbare threads of ingenuity and duplicity. And yet, even within these seemingly monolithic entities, diversity lurks, a subterranean world of conflicting values and interests waiting to be unearthed.\n\nValues, the hidden architecture of culture, hold the key to understanding the why behind a people's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are sacred tenets in a culture, then a negotiator must tread with care, lest they inadvertently offend or disrupt the delicate balance. Conversely, a culture that places its faith in the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by concessions or compromise. To succeed, a negotiator must don the cloak of empathy, learning to see the world through the eyes of their opponent, to grasp the personal stakes that drive them forward. Only then can the labyrinth of culture be navigated, and the art of negotiation mastered.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a lone voice whispers a refrain: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase, an echo of Psalm 14, finds its way into the writings of St. Anselm, a beacon of faith amidst the darkness. It is a notion that also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, a seeker of truth in a world beset by shadow. Both men, in their quest for the divine, weave arguments that dance upon the fringes of reason and faith. Yet, in their zeal to prove the existence of a God, they falter in their grasp of the whole.\n\nLet us begin with St. Anselm's creed, a path that winds inward, seeking answers within the recesses of the soul. He posits that the proof of God's existence lies within the mind's own labyrinth, a realm where truth is forged in the crucible of understanding. The nonexistence of God, to Anselm, is a notion that cannot be conceived, a void that defies the very fabric of our being. In this, he suggests that the search for God is not an external endeavor, but an introspective journey, where the truth lies hidden within the recesses of the self.\n\nThis notion of faith, a reliance on the unseen, is a thread that weaves through Christian texts, a testament to the power of the human spirit. Yet, it is a concept that stands in stark contrast to the rationalist's creed, that of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas, driven by a desire to prove the existence of God through the lens of reason, presents five arguments that seek to pierce the veil of uncertainty. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each a stepping stone on the path to the divine.\n\nIn this, Aquinas seeks to persuade, to convince the doubter that the existence of God is not a matter of faith, but of logic. The missing piece of the puzzle, though unseen, can be inferred through the careful assembly of the rest. Yet, in their pursuit of the divine, both men falter, their arguments incomplete, their understanding of the whole imperfect. Like two travelers lost in a wilderness, they strain to see beyond the horizon, yet the truth eludes them, a mirage on the horizon of the human condition.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a figure emerged, one who would come to be known as the Buddha. His birth, a mere whisper in the annals of the past, a faint tremor in the sands of the forgotten. A prince, a wanderer, a seeker of truth. The world, a labyrinth of suffering, of desire, of hatred, of delusion. He roamed, a pilgrim in a world bereft of solace, until he found the path. The path of the Buddha, a narrow, winding road that led to the precipice of enlightenment.\n\nTime, a merciless taskmaster, wore down the rough edges of the world, leaving in its wake the smooth, weathered stones of tradition. Theravada Buddhism, the most austere of the Buddha's teachings, a sect born of the fires of the past, tempered by the hammer of the ages. In the crucible of time, the religion was purified, its core doctrine burning bright like a coal in the darkness.\n\nIn the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony was observed, a water-cutting celebration, a ritual born not of the Buddha's teachings, but of the necessities of the world. Monks and laymen alike participated, their footsteps echoing through the empty streets, a distant memory of a forgotten past. The ceremony, a thin thread in the tapestry of tradition, a reminder that the Buddha's teachings were but a starting point, a foundation upon which the edifice of the religion was built.\n\nForces, both internal and external, hostile and benign, shaped the course of the religion. The internal forces, born of the members of the Buddhasasana, a community of seekers, of monks and laymen, who struggled to maintain the purity of the doctrine. The external forces, a maelstrom of influences, a tide of ideas, of cultures, of histories, that threatened to engulf the fragile flower of the faith.\n\nIn the depths of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist text, lay the core of the religion. The Sutta Pitaka, a collection of sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, a codex of disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a treatise on the metaphysical components of the faith. Anatta, the doctrine of no soul, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, these were the building blocks of the religion.\n\nThe four noble truths, the foundation of the Buddha's teachings, a simple, yet profound, doctrine. Dukkha, the truth of suffering, the second truth, that attachment causes suffering, and the third, that suffering can be overcome. The path to enlightenment, a winding road, fraught with peril, yet beset on all sides by the siren call of desire, of hatred, of delusion.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, in the darkness of the forest, the Buddha's words echoed through the ages, a call to the seeker, a whispered promise of liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. The Theravada community, a fragile, flickering flame, threatened by the winds of time, yet burning brightly, a beacon in the darkness, a testament to the power of the Buddha's teachings.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a struggle unfolded between two nations, the United States and Mexico. Their enduring enmity, forged in the depths of history, spanned 57 years, a prolonged and arduous test of wills. The tumultuous saga of their rivalry reached its zenith in the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the landscape and left an indelible mark on the American Southwest. The echoes of that war still resonated long after its conclusion, casting a pall of animosity over the shared borders of the two nations.\n\nA maelstrom of competing interests, fueled by clashing values and traditions, had set the stage for this rivalry. The divide between the two nations was further exacerbated by the incompatibility of their material pursuits, a chasm that seemed insurmountable. The stakes were high, and the tension between the two nations was palpable, a powder keg waiting to be ignited.\n\nLike the rusting hulks of abandoned ships, other nations had been shipwrecked on the rocky shores of history, their once-promising relationships reduced to nothing more than a distant memory. The United States and Mexico, however, were not so fortunate, their tumultuous past a constant reminder of the perils of animosity. David M. Pletcher's words, etched in the annals of history, served as a stark reminder: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The proximity of these nations to the United States only served to heighten the sense of unease, a constant reminder of the fragility of their relations.\n\nThe bitter pill of religious intolerance had poisoned the well of their diplomacy, a festering wound that refused to heal. Sally Frahm's words, a poignant reminder of the past, echoed through the ages: \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm that yawned between the two nations was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, a testament to the enduring power of dogma.\n\nThe legacy of distrust, inherited from their colonial past, weighed heavily upon the two nations, a millstone that threatened to engulf them both. The weight of their shared history, a burden they could not shake, had sapped the life from their relations, leaving only a husk of what once was. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by their rivalry, served as a testament to the enduring power of their animosity.\n\nAs the years passed, the rivalry finally began to subside, its embers slowly extinguished by the gentle rains of time. Mexico's dependence on the United States had become a fait accompli, a reality that could no longer be denied. Schmitt's words, a cold comfort to those who had lived through the tumult, served as a reminder that even the most intractable of conflicts can eventually come to an end: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (Schmitt 1974, p. 109). The rivalry, once a burning fire that had threatened to consume them both, had finally been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.",
            "Fifteen years of desolation had ravaged my body, a silence where once there was strength. It began without warning, an unwelcome guest that would not depart. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the vulnerable, a sentinel of the sick. The promise of security had drawn me to this vocation, a shield against the tempests of my own childhood. My heart had whispered to me in the darkness: \"You will always find a place to stand, a roof to shelter beneath.\" And so I chose the path of the healer, though my true desires had lain elsewhere.\n\nThe scientist, the journalist – these were the voices that had whispered in my ear, urging me to explore the unknown, to seek the truth. But I had silenced them, taming the wild within. Fifteen years of living on the frayed threads of Social Security Disability had stripped me bare, leaving naught but the echoes of what once was. Every day a struggle, a battle against the void that yawned within. My family, my friends – they had been my lifeline, my fragile thread of hope in the darkness. And when disaster struck, it was not the strength of my own heart that saw me through, but the kindness of those who stood beside me.\n\nThis, I have come to understand, is the truth of the human condition. We are not islands, unmoored and alone. We are a tapestry, intricately woven, each strand connected to the next. And when the storms of life assail us, it is not our individual fortitude that will see us through, but the bonds we have forged with one another.\n\nI do not advocate for the rejection of preparedness. A disaster kit, a first aid kit, a cache of supplies – these are wise preparations for the uncertainties of life. But let us not forget the most essential resource of all: the human heart. Let us not confuse self-reliance with the cold, hard stone of isolation. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the Rockies, but the warmth of community, the generosity of strangers, and the love that bound them together.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Stockpile your supplies, hone your skills, and learn to tend the fire of compassion within yourself. But as you do, also tend the fires of connection that bind us all. For when the darkness closes in, it is not our individual candles that will light the way, but the collective flame of our shared humanity.",
            "In the dark of the universe, a question lingers, a whispered query that echoes through the void: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, hidden shackles that govern the direction of change? It is a question that has haunted the minds of scholars for centuries, a puzzle that has resisted the efforts of even the most brilliant minds. As D'Arcy Thompson once said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so we find ourselves in a similar predicament, struggling to grasp the intricacies of life's unfolding tapestry.\n\nBut it is in the realm of mollusks, those creatures of the ancient earth, that we may find a glimpse of the answers we seek. Through the lens of mathematical modeling, we have endeavored to unravel the mysteries of Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep. Our study, a testament to the power of human ingenuity, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern evolution's pace, that subtle dance of life and death.\n\nWe began by delving into the realm of X-radiography, that wondrous tool that reveals the hidden truths of the shell. Like a mapmaker charting the unseen territories of a new world, we sought to delineate the parameters that govern the shell's morphology. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into the fabric of our mathematical model, CerioShell. With this tool, we crafted hypothetical scenarios, possibilities that danced like specters in the void, waiting to be interpreted.\n\nAnd so we turned to the shell, that most ancient and enigmatic of forms. A tube that traverses the realm of time, a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each revolution, each turn of the shell, a whorl that spirals around the central axis, the columella. A continuous line, a suture, separates each whorl, a boundary that marks the passage of time. And at the apex of this spiral, the largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel, a testament to the shell's enduring presence.\n\nWe may view the shell from different perspectives, apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a window into the secrets of the shell's structure. And it is here, in the realm of the aperture, that we find the key to understanding the shell's trajectory, its path through time and space.\n\nLike a thread unwinding from a spool, the aperture travels through the ages, a series of coordinates that chart the shell's growth. And it is this trajectory that we have sought to graphically and mathematically represent, a dance of numbers and lines that reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nBut our work is far from over. For in the realm of the shell, we find not only the secrets of the past, but also the keys to the future. And so we continue to modify the parameters, to vary the variables, to see how the shell's skeletogenesis responds to the whims of chance and necessity.

The rates of neonatal and infant mortality, a bloody stain on the otherwise hopeful narrative of development, remain stubbornly static, refusing to yield to the ceaseless push of progress. Like a withered vine, they cling to the soil, a testament to the entrenched problems that plague the country's maternal and child health. The Millennium Development Goals, once a beacon of hope, now seem an unattainable dream, their targets slipping further and further from grasp.\n\nA glimmer of light flickers in the darkness, a 72% of births attended by skilled health workers, a number that masks the truth, for it includes traditional practitioners, unprepared to face the complications that can arise. The numbers whisper sweet nothings of improvement, but the reality is far more dire, with maternal deaths claiming their victims like a merciless harvest. The statistics on diarrheal cases in children under five, a grim reminder of the unforgiving power of disease, tell a tale of neglect and abandonment.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a frail reed, bends before the wind, a paltry 4%, a stark reminder of the inadequacies of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The urban-rural divide, a chasm that yawns wide and deep, reveals the ugly truth of unequal access to care, a reflection of a system that favors the fortunate few, while condemning the many to the cold, unforgiving darkness of neglect. The vertical equity gap, a precipice that threatens to swallow all, stands at 27%, a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by the poor in accessing the very services that could save their lives.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the specter of neonatal and maternal mortality, the question hangs in the air like a challenge, how to bridge the yawning chasm of care. Shall Indonesia succumb to the siren song of programmatic approaches, targeting specific sectors, or shall it strive to strengthen the very foundations of its health system, a stone upon stone, a pyramid of care that reaches up to the heavens? The siren's call is seductive, promising quick fixes and tangible results, but at what cost? The drawbacks are legion, a hydra-like monster that devours resources, siphons talent, and spawns duplication and disarray.\n\nIn the end, the choice is not a simple one, a binary decision between two paths, but a labyrinthine puzzle that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to confront the darkness that lies at the heart of Indonesia's health crisis. The journey ahead will be long and arduous, but it is a journey that must be taken, for the sake of the children, the mothers, and the very soul of the nation.",
            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the Victorian era, a peculiar dichotomy emerged – novels that eschewed the traditional trappings of the aristocracy and instead delved into the depths of the human experience. Two such outliers are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, novels that defied convention with their enthralling mysteries and unflinching portrayals of the bizarre. Like twisted threads, these novels wove intricate narratives that probed the innermost recesses of their characters, casting a flickering light on their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the protagonist navigated the treacherous landscape of his own mind, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred. The cacophony of his thoughts grew louder, an unrelenting maelstrom of emotions and ideas that threatened to consume him whole. The words of Sikes and Crackit still lingered in his mind, their acrimonious dispute lingering like a ghostly presence. He stumbled backward, shocked by the report of firearms, as the world around him dissolved into chaos – lights blurring, sounds jarring, and an unseen force propelling him forward.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, an unspoken awareness of pain seared his consciousness, an unrelenting torment that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employed this technique of mystery to illuminate the inner workings of their characters. Through dream sequences and states of altered consciousness, these novels plumbed the depths of their subjects, revealing the hidden recesses of their psyches. In Oliver Twist, these dreamlike episodes served as a window into Oliver's inner world, a realm where his deepest fears and insecurities lay bare.\n\nThe shooting of Oliver Twist, revisited in chapter 28, served as a catalyst for this narrative. As Oliver relived the event, his senses numbed by the trauma, he struggled to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. The unseen hand that bore him away was a potent symbol of his loss of control, a stark reminder that he was powerless to shape his own destiny. The perpetual pain that gnawed at his consciousness served as a constant reminder of his vulnerability, a vulnerability that had been exploited by the forces of darkness that surrounded him.\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming despair, the question arose – whose will had brought about his downfall? Was it his own, or the machinations of those who sought to control him? The shooting served as a testament to Oliver's growing sense of defeat, a defeat that had been insidiously insinuated by the forces of oppression that had worn him down.\n\nAs the darkness closed in, the world seemed to shrink, its boundaries compressing into an endless expanse of silence and desolation. The passing of time became a distant memory, a fleeting whisper in the void. And in this void, the characters of these novels struggled to find meaning, their lives reduced to a series of fragmented moments, suspended in the eternal twilight of uncertainty.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of the human experience, these novels stood as beacons of hope, illuminating the darkest recesses of the human heart. They dared to venture into the unknown, to confront the mysteries that lay beyond the boundaries of conventional narrative. And in doing so, they created works of profound beauty, works that continue to haunt us to this day.",
            "The shadows crept across the worn linoleum of the after-school program, a faint reminder of the day's passage. I had worked there, tutoring the younger ones, my strength lying in the realm of English and the written word. The boy, Adrian, a third or fourth grader, had been assigned to me, his struggles with reading a puzzle I sought to unravel. It started with the alphabets, the letters that danced upon the page, yet to him, a riddle. He would pronounce some with ease, while others defied him, a stark contrast that left me perplexed. His mother, a woman of unspoken words, entered our world one fateful day, her silence a testament to the language barrier that stood between us. Our communication, a halting dance of gestures and broken phrases.\n\nThe truth dawned on me like a winter's dawn, a slow and gradual realization: Adrian's struggles lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet. His proficiency in speech, a spoken language, belied his struggle with the written word. Though he spoke English with clarity, the written form eluded him. In that moment, I grasped the complexity of the issue, a problem that persisted long after our meetings.\n\nThat tale I recount, a testament to the unseen struggles of the language barrier, particularly in the state of California. It is a problem that defies easy solutions, a tangled web of complexities that require a multifaceted approach. In Adrian's case, the answer lay in targeted tutoring, a concentrated effort to teach him the English alphabet and pronunciation. Yet, for those who barely speak the language, the solution proves far more elusive.\n\nThe dual language system, a concept often met with skepticism, holds promise. Not limited to children of Spanish descent, it benefits all, as studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Fears of wasted resources and limited benefits are unfounded. If implemented as a standard, rather than an exception, all children would reap its rewards. But how to achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, a daunting expectation. However, the presence of bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever one may call them, is a reasonable and realistic solution.\n\nIn the end, the answer lies not in a single approach, but in a fusion of methods, a harmonious blend of ESL classes, private tutors, and mainstream immersion. It is a challenge that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to adapt. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, can be bridged, but it demands a collective effort, a shared understanding that the solutions lie not in isolation, but in cooperation.",
            "In the earliest of hours, we are fed a notion that there is a vastness beyond our own, a reality that defies comprehension.  Some are schooled in its presence, others seek it within the confines of their own minds, and still, others reject its very existence. The paths we choose are as varied as the stars that fill the night sky. We seek a beacon to guide us through the shadows, a light to lead us into the warmth of the sun.\n\nMy father's voice cut through the rain pounding the tin roof of our porch like a dirge. He stared out into the gray, his eyes a mix of longing and remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his frame like a specter. His hair, once a rich abundance, now thinned and sparse. I felt a cold dread, a weight that pressed upon my chest. Our conversation hung in the air like the rain, heavy with unspoken words. I reached out, my arms wrapping around him, a futile attempt to hold onto the man who was slipping away from me. We sat in silence, our eyes fixed on the rain, the sound a cadence that echoed through my mind.\n\nFive days after my twenty-second birthday, he was gone. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but not eased it. I had not been present for his passing. I could not bear to witness the end of the man who had given me life. Instead, I remembered him by the laughter, the stories, the love. The thought of a God who would allow such a fate was a cruel joke. I did not pray in the darkness, for I knew He had stopped listening long ago.\n\nIn the days that followed, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news that would come. The silence was deafening. No one called. It was as if the world had moved on, leaving me behind. I lay there, lost in the shadows, my heart heavy with grief.",
            "In a paradoxical marriage of the antique and the modern, the Gothic Novel emerges, an oxymoronic fusion of the bygone and the new. Ian Watt aptly describes it as a \"Gothic Novel\" - an antithesis of the novel's own rising ascendancy (Watt). Blasted by scorn and praise, the Gothic mode is accused of vacuity and lauded for its ability to conjure an aura of the terrible sublime (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, brokers a union of the archaic and the novelistic, forging a new literary discourse. Walpole weaves together venerable theatrical elements and the artificial simulation of nature, yielding what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, a palimpsest of medieval theatricality, architecture, and tradition, is replete with throwbacks to a bygone era. Even in the era of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the word \"Gothic\" was a catch-all term, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was regarded as a relic of a bygone age, a fossil of a more unsophisticated time. The confluence of the Gothic's theatrical leanings and the novel's novelistic innovations allowed it to endure, even as it became anachronistic, a relic of a bygone era, yet simultaneously novel and fresh to a reader dislocated from the original text.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic Novel lies the concept of Chivalry, an abstraction of medieval valor, which is both retained and transmuted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the catechism of the virtuous knight, is a lodestar for Gothic writers, a beacon of honor, valor, and competence in a world perceived as morally bankrupt (Walpole). Through the prism of Chivalry, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the nascent Romantic movement. Walpole, a man beset by the troubles of his time, wrote The Castle of Otranto as a cri de coeur, a lament for the lost virtues of a bygone era. His writing is a cri de coeur, a plea for the rediscovery of the nobility and integrity that he perceived as having been lost in the mire of his contemporaries. In Frederic, Walpole crafts a character who embodies the chivalric ideal. His description is a litany of traditional chivalric tropes: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a knight, beset by the vicissitudes of fate. The figure of the gallant and courteous knight is, of course, an exaggeration, a trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "In the desolate wasteland of commerce, where the wind howls like a mournful cry, supply chain management emerges as a behemoth, a behemoth born from the fertile soil of necessity. Its genesis dates back to 1982, when Keith Oliver, a sage of industry, first coined the term. Like a prophet proclaiming the arrival of a new era, Oliver described the grand symphony of processes that unfold from customer order to raw materials, production, and distribution. The aim: to satiate the void of customer needs with an efficiency that borders on the efficient.\n\nSix pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce wield these pillars to conjure a symphony of customer satisfaction. But what is production, the first and most vital of these pillars? Production is the foundation, the bedrock upon which the entire edifice stands. It is the time, place, and manner in which goods are brought forth. Only by listening to the whispers of the market can managers divine the desires of the customer. The market, a fickle mistress, beckons the manager to decipher its secrets, to unravel the mysteries of demand. And once the veil is lifted, the manager must decide what products to birth, how many to produce, and where and when to birth them. The production stage is a delicate waltz, a dance of schedules and equipment maintenance, a ballet of precision and detail.\n\nBut the rhythm of production is not the only beat in this grand symphony. Supply, the second pillar, is a symphony of strategic decisions, a harmonious union of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Like a master conductor, the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product, and when to outsource, to create a melody of velocity – a symphony of quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn the retail temples of Wal-Mart and Target, the design of production, inventory, and logistics is a testament to the power of well-crafted processes. Like a well-planned ritual, every step is choreographed to minimize confusion and maximize efficiency. And thus, the supply chain management, this grand symphony, unfolds, a majestic dance of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, all orchestrated to satiate the customer's insatiable hunger.",
            "A faded sign stood crookedly in the dusty air, a weathered piece of cardboard held aloft by an unseen hand. Ellen Page, a star of a world now long gone, stood isolated on a forgotten street, her eyes cast down at the scribbled message scrawled upon her makeshift placard. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the letters stark and black against the pale canvas. Burma, a land shrouded in an aura of oppression, a Southeastern Asian nation ruled by a regime of unforgiving steel. The year was some distant past, a time when protests raged like wildfires, when monks in rust-colored robes marched through the streets, their chanting a call to arms against the iron fist of the military junta.\n\nIt was a time of blood and fire, of screams in the darkness and the scent of smoke. The monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, now walked the thin line between peace and anarchy. The government, its grip on power like a vice, squeezed tighter with each passing day. Foreign journalists, witnesses to the carnage, were rounded up and cast into the depths of some forsaken prison. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell to the ground, his life extinguished by a single bullet, simply for bearing witness to the chaos.\n\nBut Burma was not an isolated case. Throughout the ages, governments had sought to snuff out dissent, to maintain their hold on the masses. The early Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, ruled with an iron fist, their decrees absolute and unyielding. The Japanese emperors, deities in a land of rising suns, claimed divine right to lead their people to prosperity, even as they walked the thin line between life and death. And in a world far removed from these distant lands, a leader, a man of power and influence, held weekly conference calls with a self-proclaimed prophet, a man who spoke of a world divided, a world of the faithful and the damned.\n\nTiananmen Square, a place of blood and memory, echoed with the whispers of the past. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students, bound together by a shared desire for freedom, stood united against the crushing weight of their oppressors. The death toll was a number shrouded in mystery, a figure that danced between 200 and 3,000, a statistic that only served to fuel the fires of outrage. The Rwandan genocide, a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, left a trail of death and despair in its wake, a reminder that the human heart is capable of atrocities beyond comprehension.\n\nAnd Hitler's Third Reich, a monstrosity of a bygone era, stood as a testament to the darkest corners of the human soul. A time of unspeakable horrors, of gas chambers and crematoria, of children orphaned and women widowed, a time when the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder.\n\nThe world had changed, yet the cycle of oppression remained. The faces and places changed, but the story remained the same. And on this forgotten street, this forgotten sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" stood as a grim reminder of a world forever trapped in the cycle of blood and fire.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington's legacy stretches far across the expanse of jazz, a testament to his unyielding vitality and creative might. Like a river that refuses to be stilled, Ellington's artistry flowed on through the years, shaping the contours of his orchestra and birthing works that would come to define the genre. Though his presence at the piano was often understated, Ellington's compositional prowess knew no bounds, as he wove intricate patterns that allowed his musicians to unfurl their talents like a blooming flower.\n\nA master craftsman, Ellington constructed the framework upon which his soloists could improvise, their notes dancing like leaves on a autumn breeze. He penned phrases that coaxed the unique timbres of each band member to the fore, blending them into a harmonious whole that was greater than the sum of its parts. In doing so, he conjured sounds that were both original and timeless, a testament to his profound understanding of the orchestra's sonic tapestry.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, a notion first glimpsed in the haunting Creole Love Call. This early masterpiece, a slow and deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's predilection for using the human voice as a textural element, untethered from the shackles of lyrics. Within its six choruses, we find a testament to Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait that would come to define his oeuvre.\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue of sorts, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice unfolding like a morning mist, growing rougher towards the end like the first wisps of dawn.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo, its notes spinning out like the threads of a spider's web, as it elaborates on the basic melody and stretches towards the fringes of sound.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo, soaring like a bird set free, backed by a subtle piano phrase that weaves in and out of the shadows.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, the brass and reed sections trading call and response like the ebb and flow of a river.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, the reeds take center stage, their call and response unfolding like a great tapestry, as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus, the voice now taking on the growl of a distant dog, soloing like an instrumental virtuoso.\nTag: A final, fleeting tag, a vocal run and a dissonant trombone phrase that hangs in the air like the last wisps of a departing storm.\n\nEllington's predilection for using voice as a dimensional element is but one aspect of his stylistic hallmarks, a thread that weaves its way through his oeuvre like a river through the earth. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, as \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response that is at once both vocal and instrumental. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), with its wondrous trombone introduction by Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, extends these ideas, illuminating the complex interplay between texture, tone, and rhythm that define Ellington's greatest works.",
            "She felt a hollowness within her, an ache that gnawed at the marrow of her soul. It had begun to manifest when she was but a girl, around the age of fourteen, as her world began to unravel with the tangles of adolescence. The feeling persisted, a stubborn ember that refused to be extinguished, even as the years passed and she entered the threshold of womanhood at seventeen. Her desire had grown from an abstract longing to a yearning for something - or someone - tangible, yet she found herself immune to the entreaties of boys who sought to woo her. Their clumsy advances only served to confound her, leaving her to ponder the enigma of her own heart. Theories sprouted like weeds in her mind, but none offered a satisfying explanation for this peculiarity. And so she wandered, a stranger in her own skin, questioning the depths of her own desires.\n\nAt home, her days were typically a tranquil affair. Her parents, a paragon of calm, rarely raised their voices, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. Their disagreements, when they did arise, centered on her defiant individuality, a spirit that seemed to thrive on the energies of her parents' serenity. But today was different. As she roamed the house, seeking inspiration from the void within, a shrill cry pierced the air, followed by her mother's anguished voice. She sprinted toward the kitchen, a sense of trepidation building in her chest. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice cracking with concern. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, the words tumbling from her lips in short, labored breaths. \"Ow... sweet... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother's words were laced with desperation, and her daughter's heart swelled with a sense of duty. With a Herculean effort, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradling her in her arms, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's sterile corridors and antiseptic smells assaulted her senses, but her mind was consumed by worry for her mother. She hastened to the reception area, her voice rising above the din of the hospital, calling out for assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around, and a doctor swiftly arrived to escort her mother to a bed. As the medical staff tended to her mother's wounds, she was left to sit, her anxiety simmering like a pot about to boil over.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "In a desolate expanse of time, a study unfolded like a parched and withered leaf, tracing the enigmatic thread of fate that binds the adherents of the Mediterranean Diet to a diminished risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" a variant of the revered Med diet, unfolded its mysteries, a tapestry woven from the threads of higher plant food consumption, monounsaturated fat, and fish, against the somber backdrop of reduced animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in alcohol was permitted, a fleeting respite from the unyielding strictures of the diet.\n\nEpidemiological endeavors past had whispered promises of an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. Intervention trials had proven the diet's efficacy in guiding obese individuals toward weight loss and a more favorable ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the realm of stroke and stroke mortality remained uncharted, a siren's call to the present study.\n\nWithin the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, and without the blight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were drawn into the orbit of this study. Six epochs, spanning 20 years, witnessed the computation of an aMed diet score, culled from the self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) that chronicled the participants' nutrient intake over the preceding year. The majority of these nurses persisted in their participation, an unbroken thread of commitment.\n\nThese FFQs, subject to validation studies, were the keys to unlocking the secrets of the diet's efficacy. Reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were cross-checked against medical records, hospital documents, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, representing a small fraction of the total strokes and myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986. To mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and to reflect the long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were computed, averaging the scores from two preceding years.\n\nThe confounders, those insidious factors that could subvert the results, were accounted for by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical incantation, was employed to chart the association between the aMed score and the risks of chronic heart disease and stroke, distinguishing between fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The outcome was a revelation: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The passage of 20 years bore witness to 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, with a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In the depths of a nation, a wound festered, its putrid flesh spilling forth a stench that would one day engulf all. The year was 2007, a time when the very fabric of America's economy began to unravel. The once-mighty edifice of financial prowess came crashing down, leaving in its wake a desolate expanse of shattered dreams and broken lives. The question lingers: what calamity befell this behemoth, this leviathan of industry and progress?\n\nA closer examination reveals the genesis of this devastation: the reckless and shortsighted dealings of those who wielded power. Banks and corporations, driven by avarice and a fervent desire for growth, were goaded into issuing sub-prime loans, flooding the market with toxic debt that would eventually poison the very arteries of the economy. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those twin titans of the financial world, were coerced into buying and repackaging these defective mortgages, creating an intricate web of CDOs and CDSs that would ensnare the entire nation.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the fertile soil of the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. The stage was thus set for the impending disaster, a catastrophe that would unfold seven years later like a slow-motion train wreck. As the New York Times' Steven Holmes astutely observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes' prophetic words would come to haunt the nation, as the government-subsidized corporation careened towards the abyss, threatening a repeat of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\n\nA complex tapestry of factors contributed to the unraveling of the economy, including the proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial alchemy concoctions intertwined the nation's economy, ensnaring households and financial markets alike in a web of debt that would prove as fragile as spun sugar. The result was a nation awash in leverage, its citizens and financial institutions perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable happened: the housing bubble burst, releasing a torrent of toxic waste that drowned the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The once-mighty Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, submitting to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were crippled by a $5 trillion mortgage debt, their fate sealed when they were placed under government control in September 2008.\n\nAs the nation struggled to come to terms with the devastation, a haunting question lingered: how could so many have been so blind to the perils of their own creations? How could the very instruments of progress have been twisted into instruments of destruction? The answer, like the nation itself, was complex, multifaceted, and ultimately, heartbreaking.",
            "He'd sat at his desk, hands clasped together as if in prayer, staring at the blank page before him. The dim fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in tandem with the flashes of self-doubt that coursed through his mind. Ah, the siren song of exposition, beckoning him toward the shoals of tedious prose. He knew the drill, the faint whisper in his ear that urged him to reveal the entire backstory of his characters, to dump the history into the reader's lap like a laundry basket overflowing with dirty socks.\n\nBut he knew better. He knew that exposition, like the devil on his shoulder, was a temptress, promising a shortcut through the woods of storytelling. He'd see authors fall prey to her wiles, their narratives bogged down in a sea of unnecessary details, their readers fleeing in search of more engaging fare. Dr. Merlin, his instructor, had once shouted at her monitor, no doubt, when she found herself stuck in a quagmire of Too Much Information.\n\nAnd so he took a deep breath, forced his mind to focus, and wrote. \"Show, don't tell,\" he reminded himself, a mantra he'd learned long ago. He wrote a sentence, then another, and another, each one a small, incremental step forward in the story. He didn't tell the reader about the character's past; he showed it through the curve of a smile, the glint in the eye, the way the character's hands moved with a practiced ease.\n\nAs he wrote, the words began to flow, a gentle stream that wound its way through the story, carrying the reader along with it. He wrote of the character's first meeting with the heroine, the way their eyes met across the crowded room, the way their hands touched, sending a spark of electricity through the air. He didn't tell the reader about their romance; he showed it in the way they laughed together, the way they held each other close.\n\nAnd when the character's husband was killed, the reader felt the loss deeply, not just because of the fact of his death, but because of the way it had changed the heroine, the way it had revealed her true character. The reader mourned with her, and in doing so, was drawn deeper into the story, more invested in the heroine's journey.\n\nExposition, he knew, was a necessary evil, a way to provide context, to give the reader a sense of the world the story is set in. But it was a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk. Too much, and the reader would nod off, the story lost in a sea of unnecessary details. Too little, and the reader would be left in the dark, struggling to make sense of the narrative.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He'd walked the tightrope, and come out on the other side, the words flowing smoothly, the story unfolding like a river. Exposition, he knew, was not his enemy, but a tool, a means to an end. And with practice, he knew he could learn to wield it with precision, to show, not tell, and keep his readers enthralled.",
            "He sat and watched the flickering images, the news broadcasts from a place called Columbus, Ohio. The first one, a live feed, was from a station called NBC 4, on a day that felt like a hundred years gone, August 13, 2011. The lead story was a man, a Shad Hostettler, who had committed a heinous act. He was shown in a picture, his face twisted, his eyes sunken, a visage of pure malevolence. The story was brief, a mere two minutes, as if the weight of it was too much to bear. They spoke of wounds, multiple, inflicted by the man's own hand, and of his subsequent arrest. It was a fleeting glimpse, a momentary glance into the abyss.\n\nThe next story was a haze of silence, a void where a young man's life hung in the balance. Travis Buyers, 18, lay critically injured, a victim of a senseless act of violence. The words swirled, a vortex of confusion, as the SWAT team combed through the streets, searching for answers. But the faces that stared back, the ones that mattered, were the ones that were ignored, the ones that were left to fade into the background. It was a tale of a different kind of violence, one that was all too familiar, a story of lives left unspoken.\n\nThe broadcasts stumbled onward, a jarring sequence of images and words. A helicopter, its metal shattered, a victim of a lone gunman. A .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss. The reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, a pitiful sum for a life. The next story, a tease, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reminder that the world outside was still turning, still spinning out of control.\n\nAnd then, the focus shifted, the lens narrowing to a single, dark-skinned man, a thief in the night, a robber of a store. The words dripped with venom, a racist's venom, a poison that seeped into the very fabric of the broadcast. The man's height, his weight, his skin color, a litany of details, a litany of hate.\n\nA convicted man, a Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin, a dealer in death. The words flowed, a river of steel, a river of stone. Twenty-five years, 300 months, a sentence, a fate, a life, a life sentence. His skin, a shade of brown, a color, a label, a box to be checked. It was a story, a tale of a man, a man with a name, a man with a face, a man with a story that was left untold.\n\nHe sat, a prisoner of the screen, a prisoner of the words, a prisoner of the world. The images faded, the words dissolved, and he was left with a sense of despair, a sense of hopelessness. The world outside was a dark and twisted place, a place where lives were cheap, where stories were told, and where the faces of the forgotten were forever lost in the shadows.",
            "A bond of fraternal tethering binds two souls together - an unbreakable, irrevocable cord that weaves through the labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It is a bond that reveals itself in the most dire of circumstances, when the true nature of this tie is laid bare, be it born of good or evil. The emotions that simmer beneath its surface carry with them a heavy cost, one that is paid in full when the consequences of these feelings are confronted. It is in the depths of this bond that one can gaze into the eyes of a brother and behold one's own reflection, unencumbered by the perceptions of others. There, in the actions and the weight of those actions, lies the true characterization of a man.\n\nIn the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a forlorn journey through a landscape both lush and desolate. Their path is fraught with bitter disappointment and intense pride, culminating in a climactic scene where only one brother emerges alive. The theme is woven through the fabric of the narrative, its complexities revealed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective. This perspective serves as a window into the protagonist's inner world, a world shaped by his emotions and perceptions, both of which influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest endeavors together to their final, fateful excursion, he feels an underlying resentment towards Doodle. His was a desire for a brother who could share in his passions, to learn from him as he taught, to walk alongside him as he navigated the world. He yearned for a companion in the manner of \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" But life had other plans, and Doodle's frailty dealt a crushing blow to these aspirations. The young protagonist's dreams were dashed, leaving him with a sense of bitterness and despair.\n\nThis anger, however, was tempered by a glimmer of love, sparked by Doodle's innocent smile. This fleeting moment of tenderness revealed a depth to the protagonist's character, one that was previously shrouded in darkness. His trepidation, his consideration of infanticide, was but a facade, a testament to the complexity of human emotion. His love for Doodle, though masked by a façade of resentment, was a constant presence, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a spark of compassion.\n\nThis bond between brothers is a double-edged sword, its power both redemptive and destructive. It is a reminder that our actions have consequences, that our emotions are the guiding force behind our decisions. In the end, it is this bond that shapes us, that reveals our true character, and that demands that we confront the darkness within ourselves.",
            "The mind is a deep well of enigma, a labyrinth of shadowed corridors and dark recesses where the whispers of experience reside. As the ages passed and the world around us underwent its incremental metamorphosis, the analogies used to describe its workings also evolved, a slow and halting dance of comprehension. It was likened to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and most recently, a machine of hissing wires and glowing screens. Yet, these metaphors, like the shifting sands of the dunes, are but fleeting approximations, liable to lead us astray with their silken threads of deception.\n\nInformation, a slow and treacherous river, flows into the mind from the senses, its currents a jumble of tactile whispers, the susurrations of heat, the thrum of sound waves, and the caress of light. These raw stimuli are then transformed, alchemized by the mind's internal fires, in the crucible of bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine a traveler, traversing a forest, where the sounds of the underbrush – the rustling of leaves, the snapping of twigs – coalesce into the unmistakable presence of a wild creature, its shape and form emerging from the cacophony like a ghost from the shadows. Top-down processing, the attentive gaze of a presiding spirit, quickens our recognition, whispers the name of the creature, and assigns it its place in the grand tapestry of our experience.\n\nYet, not all information is created equal. The mind, a capricious monarch, filters out the extraneous, the trivial, the ephemeral, and reserves its attention for the essential, the vital, the meaningful. Like a sentinel, it stands guard over the gates of perception, admitting only what is deemed worthy, and rejecting the rest to the vast and uncaring expanse of the unknown. We are not aware of each blade of grass beneath our feet, nor the countless whispers of the wind, yet our minds remain vigilant, poised to respond to the subtlest hint of danger, the whispered name of a loved one in a crowded room.\n\nInformation must first be stored, and this is a task of intricate and mysterious provenance. There are multiple repositories of memory, each a dark and labyrinthine cave, hiding its secrets from the light. Sensory memory holds the fleeting impressions of the moment, the mirror-smooth surface of the water, the rough bark of the tree. Working memory, a fleeting whisper, holds the information for but a brief instant, a spark of insight that vanishes as quickly as it appears. Long-term memory, a slow and patient river, holds the accumulated wisdom of the ages, the secrets of the past, the mysteries of the yet-to-come.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the mind is a problem of ancient and abiding interest, a riddle that has puzzled scholars and sages for centuries. Some propose that it is a network of interconnected nodes, a vast and intricate web of concepts, each linked to its fellows by threads of association and relation. In this semantic tapestry, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on, an endless and labyrinthine path of meaning and connection.",
            "A specter of modernity looms large in the horizon, a dystopian vision born from the ashes of an all-consuming technological fervor and the cold, calculating tenets of capitalism. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a world where the communal over the individual has become the norm, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the paramount virtue, and the conditioning of the masses is carried out with precision by the omniscient World Controller. Beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, however, lies a web of ideological control, a subtle yet insidious dance of homogeny and reification that reduces the citizenry to mere pawns in a game of conformity.\n\nAs we delve into the world of Huxley's protagonist, we find the telltale signs of a capitalist machine at work, its gears turning, its cogs clicking into place with a calculated efficiency. The thesis of false consciousness comes to mind, a notion born from Marxist theory, where the common folk are kept in the dark about their true relations to the classes above and below, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by the World Controller's subtle hand, has created a society where the lower classes, relegated to their respective stations, are blissfully unaware of the manipulation that governs their existence. The upper echelons, meanwhile, are either complicit in this charade or resigned to their fate, their awareness of the system's machinations merely a distant echo of a long-forgotten truth.\n\nIn this sterile world, relationships are reduced to shallow interactions, a façade of connection that belies the true nature of human experience. Love, once a flame that burns bright, has been extinguished, replaced by the hollow tones of superficial affection. The characters, even those at the forefront of the narrative, are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, their thoughts and emotions stripped bare, leaving only the husk of a humanity that has been drained of its vitality. The interactions between them, a series of stilted exchanges, serve only to reinforce the notion that the rise of technology and capitalism has led to the erosion of free will and the stifling of human expression.\n\nAs we navigate the sterile landscape of Brave New World, we are left to ponder the consequences of a system that values complacency above all else. The societal classes, each resigned to their place in the hierarchy, are a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, their obedience a stark reminder of the proletariat's false consciousness. And so, we are left to wonder: in this world of calculated happiness and controlled dissent, is there room for anything more? Is there a glimmer of hope, a spark that might ignite the flame of resistance against the all-consuming machine of capitalism?\n\nIn the end, it is a question that echoes through the pages of Brave New World, a reminder that even in the most seemingly utopian of societies, the seeds of dissent and rebellion are sown, waiting to be nurtured by those who dare to challenge the status quo.",
            "Four and a half semesters at University Park. The trees lean in over the walkways, casting long shadows in the morning light. I've seen students trudge through the winter's grasp, their breath misting in the chill air. The East Halls dorms, where I first laid my head, stood sentinel at the farthest edge of campus, a bastion of isolation. To reach the Willard building, a hub of academic activity, the walk could take twenty-five minutes, the minutes ticking away like grains of sand in an hourglass. The weather, a constant companion, could slow the pace to a crawl.\n\nI spoke with a fellow student, an alumnus not much older than myself, and he spoke of the days when the East Halls dorms stood apart, surrounded by a vast expanse of vacant land. Now, that emptiness has given way to a sprawl of sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus expands, the distances between destinations lengthen, and the pathways narrow. In this labyrinth, the bicycle stands as a beacon of efficiency and freedom.\n\nBut the bike itself is mere potential, a tool waiting to be wielded. It is the student who must take the reins, who must ride the bike with purpose and intent. And the campus, too, must be designed with the bicyclist in mind, a network of roads and pathways that weave together like the threads of a tapestry.\n\nI recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joy of cycling after a hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his words laced with conviction. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The benefits of cycling extend beyond the physical, a symbiotic relationship between body and machine. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a morning ride can propel you twenty-five miles or more, a testament to the bicycle's efficiency.\n\nAs an off-campus resident, I've found myself relying on my bike to navigate the terrain. The Thomas building, a hub of academic activity, is a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep. But with the bike, that journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a testament to the power of human ingenuity. However, the road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not always an easy one, a serpentine path through the urban landscape.\n\nThere are those who prefer the gentle stroll, the rhythmic cadence of footsteps on pavement. But for me, time is a luxury I can ill afford. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, a journey that would consume an extra thirty to forty minutes of my day, a time sink that would leave me drained. The cumulative effect would be staggering, a loss of two and a half hours each week, a sacrifice I'm not willing to make.\n\nIn this crucible of time and space, the bicycle stands as a symbol of liberation, a tool that can bridge the gaps between destinations, a bridge that can be built or broken, depending on the choices we make. As the campus continues to evolve, let us not forget the humble bicycle, a simple machine that can change the world, one pedal stroke at a time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.

Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, a beacon of hope for the forsaken and the oppressed. My intention is to walk the treacherous terrain of social work, to navigate the labyrinthine paths of the abused and the neglected, and to provide solace to the troubled families that have been ravaged by the tempests of life. The values that animate my pursuit are service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the betterment of relationships and the self.\n\nIn the wasteland of uncertainty, I have often found myself lost, unsure of the path that lay ahead. Yet, it was the specter of human suffering that beckoned me, a siren's call to a life of purpose. As I traversed the barren expanse of high school and college, I witnessed the syphoning of hope from the lives of those around me. Many fled from their problems, abandoning all semblance of stability, while others clung to coping mechanisms that were little more than a veneer of despair. It was in this desolate landscape that I found my calling, a Bachelor's degree in Psychology a paltry shield against the incoming tide of human suffering.\n\nThe summer of 2009, a season of reflection, found me at a crossroads. It was then that I encountered a young boy, sixteen years old and adrift in a sea of turmoil. His story was a litany of pain, a testament to the ravages of abuse and neglect. It was in that moment that I knew my path was set, that I would walk the treacherous roads of social work, armed with nothing but a degree in Psychology and a burning desire to make a difference.\n\nThe parents, two figures shrouded in a veil of deceit, seemed to mock the very idea of help. Their words, a jarring cacophony of excuses and justifications, fell upon me like a cold wind. And yet, I knew that I had to act, to intervene in the dance of denial that had become their lives. I spoke to the police, a hesitant voice in the darkness, and offered what little knowledge I possessed. The outcome was uncertain, but I knew that I had taken the first step on a long and arduous journey.\n\nSocial justice, a concept that has haunted me since my formative years, is the fire that burns within me. A society that claims to value individuality yet seeks to suffocate it beneath a sea of conformity is a paradox that I find unbearable. I have walked this tightrope, a tightrope of self-expression and nonconformity, ever since I was a child. I have worn my hair in unnatural hues, worn clothing that defied the norms, pierced my ears in a gesture of defiance, and spoken out against the injustices that I have witnessed. And I will continue to do so, for it is in the pursuit of social justice that I find my purpose.\n\nIn the end, it is not the destination that matters, but the journey itself. It is the darkness that we face, the uncertainty that we must navigate, that shapes us into the individuals we are meant to be. And it is in the face of this uncertainty that I find solace, a solace that will guide me on my path as a social worker, a path that is fraught with peril, but one that I am willing to walk.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human condition, sleep disorders cast long shadows over the lives of countless individuals. Insomnia, a specter that haunts the minds of many, is a disorder that has been shrouded in mystery. The Biological and Sociocultural models attempt to unravel the threads that bind this enigma, each offering a unique perspective on the complexities of this affliction. This paper will delve into the recesses of these models, illuminating the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of insomnia.\n\nThe Biological model, a labyrinth of intricacies, navigates the treacherous waters of genetics and physiology. Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny sentinels of the brain, contain orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate dance of sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons hold the key to understanding the sleep-wake states of an individual. The activation of these receptors, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces a somnambulant response, while their inhibition, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, reduces anxiety and induces slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been found to increase sleep time in animal models, a discovery that hints at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. A problem or absence with this receptor, a crack in the edifice of sleep, can alter the ability to slumber without medication, leaving the individual adrift in a sea of wakefulness.\n\nThe Sociocultural model, a tapestry woven from the threads of environmental relationships, offers a broader perspective on insomnia. It examines the intersections of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, each a unique strand in the intricate web of factors that contribute to this disorder. The inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor, a genetic predisposition, can regulate sleep, and an alteration of this receptor can naturally disturb sleep, impacting aspects of life that require focus and attention. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nThe research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the complexities of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of primary sleep disorders, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Each of these disorders, a unique facet of the sleep-wake spectrum, offers a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of insomnia. The Parasomnias, a category of sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, add another layer to the tapestry of insomnia, a reminder that this disorder is not solely a product of biology, but also of the complex interplay between environment and genetics.\n\nThe research of Matsuki et al. (2009) offers a nuanced understanding of the GABAB receptor and its role in sleep regulation. The study's findings, a testament to the power of science, suggest that the activation of this receptor induces sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces somnolence. The implications of this research are far-reaching, hinting at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. This understanding can shed light on the etiology of insomnia, a disorder that has long been shrouded in mystery.\n\nHowever, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations. The study's focus on animal models, a narrow lens through which to view the complexities of human sleep, raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. The sociocultural implications of the study, a reminder that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor can regulate sleep, are also worthy of consideration. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nIn conclusion, the Biological and Sociocultural models offer a nuanced understanding of insomnia, a disorder that is both multifaceted and complex. The research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the intricacies of this affliction, and the findings of Matsuki et al. (2009) offer a glimpse into the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. However, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations, and a more comprehensive understanding of insomnia will require a broader examination of the interplay between biology and environment.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a disorder so insidious, so pervasive, that it threatens to upend the very fabric of our understanding. This is Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a malady that besets the central nervous system, rendering it incapable of processing the auditory world with the clarity and precision it demands. Like a desert wind that withers the trees, CAPD robs its victims of the ability to discern the subtleties of sound, leaving them lost and adrift in a sea of cacophony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first stumbled upon the concept of \"auditory imperception.\" Like a faint echo, it was a notion that lingered in the shadows, waiting to be fleshed out by the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954. Their pioneering work laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the disorder, and it was not until 1961 that Kimura introduced the concept of dichotic testing, a method that would allow researchers to peer into the very workings of the brain's auditory processing machinery.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in a multitude of ways, each one a bitter reminder of the disorder's insidious power. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, as if the very notion of spatial awareness has been lost on them. They may falter in distinguishing between two or more acoustic events, their minds unable to discern the subtleties of sound. The patterns of speech, once a reliable guidepost, now become a jumbled mess of confusion. And the sequence of sounds, once a logical progression, becomes a maddening puzzle.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and doubt. The process involves a systematic observation of listening behavior, a painstaking examination of the patient's auditory function, and a series of tests designed to push the limits of their processing abilities. Like a desert wanderer searching for an oasis, the clinician must navigate a labyrinthine maze of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations, all in the hope of uncovering the hidden truth. There is no single, foolproof test, no silver bullet that can guarantee a diagnosis. The disorder remains a mystery, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and deceives.\n\nYet, even in the face of uncertainty, there is hope. A teacher, armed with knowledge and compassion, can be a beacon of light in the darkness. By understanding the subtleties of CAPD, they can create an environment that is supportive and inclusive, a haven where the afflicted can learn to navigate the complexities of the auditory world. It is a challenge, yes, but one that can be met with patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the disorder's insidious power.\n\nIn the end, it is not the disorder that defines us, but our response to it. Like the desert itself, CAPD is a harsh and unforgiving environment, but it is one that can be navigated, one that can be overcome. And it is in this knowledge that we find hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness that guides us forward, ever forward, into the unknown.",
            "The artificial masquerade of Twelfth Night poses a dire question: can one ever truly shed the skin of deception, or are we forever bound to the guises we've assumed? The play's exploration of disguise reveals a bitter truth: the art of deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting us free from the shackles of our true selves, yet ensnaring us in a labyrinth of alienation and disconnection.\n\nIn the fleeting world of the theater, Viola's ruse as Cesario serves as a fragile bulwark against the cruelties of a foreign land. Yet, this calculated stratagem exacts a terrible toll, severing her ties to the women who might have offered her solace and support. Her impersonation becomes so convincing that it beguiles even the lovesick Olivia, who sees in Cesario a reflection of her own desires, rather than the truth of Viola's own heart.\n\nAs the play unfolds, the masks of identity begin to slip, revealing the tangled web of suppressed emotions that lies beneath. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario may be a jest, a satire of the societal norms that reduce people to shallow facades. Her sudden switch to Sebastian, however, hints at a more profound truth: that true love knows no bounds, nor is bound by the strictures of societal expectation. \n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: can we ever truly shed the disguises we've worn, or are we forever trapped in a hall of mirrors, reflecting back at us the distortions of our own making? The characters of Olivia and Orsino, caught in the whirlpool of their own desires, seem to suggest that sometimes the only way to break free is to confront the shadows that lie within.\n\nIn this harsh world of masquerade and deception, we are forced to confront the darkness within ourselves, and the price we pay for the disguises we wear. The play's exploration of this theme serves as a reminder that our true selves are forever hidden, like a vein of coal in the earth, waiting to be unearthed by the rocky tides of experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the colonial landscape, a tale of contrasts unfolds. The German colonial empire, a behemoth of brutality and exploitation, left an indelible mark on the nations it claimed. The genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa stands as a gruesome testament to the empire's unyielding ferocity. Yet, this is but a single thread in the complex tapestry of German colonial rule, a story woven from diverse policies, governing styles, and geography.\n\nThe educational provision across the colonies mirrors the empire's multifaceted nature. In East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of educated and literate Africans, a legacy of German efforts that earned praise from contemporary observers. In contrast, South West Africa presented a stark picture of neglect, where the task of native education fell to missionary societies, coddled by the government's limited support. Simultaneously, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, haunting South West Africa long after the empire's collapse.\n\nThe divergent experiences of the German colonies can be attributed to a constellation of social, political, and economic factors. This paper seeks to illuminate these influences, casting a spotlight on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. A rich literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, mostly penned in German and composed during or shortly after the period of colonial rule. These early works aimed to catalog the features of educational systems, while later English-language studies delved deeper, conducting comparative analyses and probing specific aspects of education. The seminal work of Cohen stands as a benchmark, dissecting the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, and pinpointing the large settler population as a key factor driving the differences between them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of arid desert and temperate oases, boasted a European population of nearly 15,000 by 1913, dwarfing the settler population of East Africa. This demographic disparity had profound implications for the colony's educational landscape, as evidenced by Cohen's study. In the shadows of the colonial edifice, the voices of the native Africans remain silenced, their experiences and perspectives lost to the annals of history. This narrative, though, offers a glimpse into the labyrinthine corridors of the colonial psyche, illuminating the dark recesses of a bygone era, where the shadows of oppression continue to linger.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the landscape of popular music has undergone a metamorphosis, a morass of genres that defy classification. Like a barren wasteland, the terrain is pockmarked with the remnants of bygone eras, each one a testament to the transience of sound. The behemoth that is Heavy Metal, a leviathan of a genre, has sprawled across the musical tapestry, its tendrils reaching into the very depths of the human experience.\n\nWithin this behemoth, a labyrinth of sub and sub-sub genres has spawned, each one a reflection of the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A darkness that is at once a manifestation of the human condition, and a reflection of the primal fears that lurk within us all. It is a darkness that is expressed through the cathartic release of sound, a symphony of rage and despair that echoes through the void.\n\nAnd yet, despite the diversity that has come to define Heavy Metal, there is a unifying thread that runs through it all - the thread of darkness. A darkness that is not just a reflection of the music itself, but a reflection of the world in which we live. A world that is beset on all sides by the ravages of time, a world that is slowly succumbing to the entropy that is inherent in all things.\n\nIt is a world that is reflected in the lyrics of the damned, the ravings of the tormented, and the screams of the desperate. A world that is captured in the swirling vortex of sound that is Heavy Metal, a world that is both beautiful and ugly, a world that is both a reflection of ourselves, and a reflection of our place in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of musical innovation, were among the first to tap into this wellspring of darkness, their song Helter Skelter a paean to the chaos that lies at the heart of human experience. A song that is both a reflection of the turmoil that ravages our souls, and a reflection of the resilience that allows us to carry on in the face of adversity.\n\nLike the first tentative steps into the unknown, the creation of Heavy Metal was a journey into the very heart of darkness. A journey that has taken us to the very limits of human endurance, and beyond. A journey that has left us scarred, bruised, and forever changed. And yet, it is a journey that we continue to embark upon, a journey that is both a testament to our resilience, and a reflection of our own mortality.",
            "In a world that slumbered beyond the veils of sanity, a man with a brush born of dreams conjured forth visions on canvas. Henri Rousseau, a name etched in the annals of time, toiled in obscurity, his heart afire with the passion of creation. The Dream, a 1910 tapestry woven from the very fabric of his being, revealed not only a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, but also the artist's own tortured struggle to find acceptance in a world that shunned the unconventional.\n\nAs the moon cast its silvery glow upon the rolling hills of northwest France, where Rousseau's own life's canvas was set to unfurl, the seeds of his destiny were sown. Born on a fateful day in May, 1844, the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, Rousseau's early life was a tapestry of ordinary toil and quiet desperation. The call of art, however, beckoned, and he heeded the siren's song, though his formal training was but a distant memory, lost in the mists of time. The title of douanier, a customs inspector, clung to him like a shroud, a badge of a life unlived.\n\nThe passing of his first wife, Clémence, and the silent departure of eight infant children left Rousseau with but a single daughter, Julia, and a void that could not be filled. In the face of such desolation, he turned to the brush, a refuge from the abyss that yawned before him. Unlike his contemporaries, who saw the peasant as a symbol of rustic charm, Rousseau saw himself in their midst, a folk painter, driven by the hopes and fears of the common man.\n\nThe weight of his unfulfilled dreams pressed upon him like a physical force, a constant reminder that he was but a novice in a world of masters. The likes of Matisse, with his revolutionary style, eclipsed Rousseau, a painter of convention, whose very ambition was to be accepted by the art world. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the two men were poles apart, their reasons for painting as disparate as the stars in a midnight sky: Matisse, driven by a terror of the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint with such banality that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau bared his soul, a canvas of longing, of the struggle to balance the desire for recognition with the need to remain true to oneself. A world of dreams and reality blurred, as the artist's inner demons wrestled with the external world, a battleground where the lines between truth and art were forever blurred. And so, in the Dream, we see not only a woman lost in a mystical realm, but the very essence of Rousseau's being, a man torn asunder by the conflicting desires of his heart and mind.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread weaves its way through the tapestry of ethics and aesthetics, a subtle yet unbreakable bond between truth and beauty. It is a notion that has been pondered by the greatest minds, a notion that transcends the confines of education and experience. As the poet John Keats so eloquently puts it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is as if the essence of morality and art is an unspoken language, one that resonates within us, yet defies the constraints of words.\n\nWe grapple with the complexities of what is good and beautiful, but our attempts to pin down these concepts fall short. They elude us like a will-o'-the-wisp, always just out of reach. Our analyses of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa may revolve around concepts like foreground and background, but ultimately, these are mere descriptions, not the source of its beauty. When asked to explain the power of a favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to vague phrases like \"There's just something about it.\" This is because, as the writer Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nSimilarly, ethics defies reduction to a set of rules or principles. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendent quality, this unnamable \"je ne sais quoi,\" that binds ethics and aesthetics together. This intangible connection is what makes art and morality so powerful, so resonant.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is beyond the reaches of language, a level that is noumenal, to use the Kantian term. This is where the impact of art and morality is felt most profoundly, in the depths of our being. And nowhere is this connection more evident than in literature, where the moral quality is an integral part of its very essence. As is said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the depths of a land forsaken, where the Alps stood sentinel and the Baltic sea lapped against the shores, a nation arose, forged from the crucible of a thousand cultures. The Germany of today stands as a testament to this incongruity, a land of contrasts, where the shadows of the past linger, and the ghosts of empires past whisper through the valleys. From the storied city of München, where the Alps cradle the heart of the nation, to the wind-swept shores of the Baltic, where the grey sea meets the grey skies, the German spirit is a tapestry woven from threads of disparate cultures, a testament to the resilience of a people forged in the fire of adversity.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" is a whispered secret, shrouded in the mists of time, its origins disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a voice from the past, claimed that the name arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, their name a reminder of the tumultuous battles they fought against the Gaulish forces. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, a conqueror of lands and a chronicler of the human spirit, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, a testament to the clash of civilizations that shaped the fate of a continent. He took the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered and the unconquered, the defeated and the defiant.\n\nAs the years passed, the question of the name's origin persisted, a mystery that refused to yield to the passage of time. Some posited that it referred to the spear, the \"ger\" that the Germanic warriors wielded in battle, a symbol of their unyielding resolve. Others suggested that it came from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that captured the essence of the Germanic people, their voices raised in defiance, their spirits unbroken. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the cold light of the first century, penned a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Germans, a people who dwelled in a land of wild beauty, where the skies were unforgiving and the people were unyielding. In his De Origine et situ Germanorum, he wrote of the Germans as a people apart, unbroken by the tides of history, their culture a testament to their enduring presence. Who would leave the warmth of Asia or Africa, the grandeur of Rome, for the wilds of Germania, unless it were their home, their heart's desire? (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so the Germanic tribes dwelled on the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a reminder of the empire's reach, their influence a testament to the power of a people unbroken by the forces of conquest. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their presence a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward, always a path to be forged.

            "I gazed down, a vacant expression etched on my face, my mind sifting through the scene before me like ashes in a gust of wind. The world was a vast, unbroken canvas, its colors muted and its texture rough, like the pockmarked skin of a long-forgotten land. My thoughts were a ceaseless flow, a river of comprehension that ebbed and flowed, never quite coalescing into anything tangible. It was as if I'd shed the burden of thought, leaving myself to drift on a tide of observation.\n\nYears ago, in a dimly lit room, I'd stumbled upon a book on drawing. It was a meager thing, a handful of lines and shapes, but it spoke to something deep within me. The author spoke of squares, of frames, of the way the mind can be tricked into seeing the world anew. I'd wanted to draw since I was a child, to capture the world in all its messy beauty. But it was more than that – it was a way to hold the world still, to pin it down like a butterfly on a pin. The artist's frame was a device, a tool to corral the chaos, to tame the unmanageable.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in time, I couldn't conjure the artist's square. The world was too vast, too overwhelming. I was lost in the depths of it, a small, insignificant speck, adrift in a sea of wonder. The masters – Picasso, Monet, the Italians – they'd all had their moments, their epiphanies. If I were to be an artist, if I were to leave my mark on the world, it had to start here, with this, the beginning of my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for the toilet handle, my thoughts a jumble of anxiety and frustration. Water swirled, a vortex of crystal clear water, and I was powerless to stop it. My hand jerked, spasmed, and struck the handle again, but the package remained, stubborn and unyielding, a mocking presence in the midst of my creative crucible.\n\nI stood there, a man lost in a world of his own making, a world of brown and beige and dull, unyielding matter. My grip on the mop tightened, my feet planted firmly on the ground, as I gazed upon the offending bundle. A few more minutes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved, slow and deliberate, towards the wall, towards the toilet paper, towards the ultimate act of creation. I was a sculptor, a master of the mundane, and this was my masterpiece.\n\nAs I dipped my hand into the bowl, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of purpose. This was art, this was creation, and I was its master. And for a moment, in that moment, I was free.",
            "In the twilight of lives, when the morrow's dawn still clings to the horizon like a shroud, a specter stalks the roads, a harbinger of death. Teenagers, blinded by the siren song of freedom, their eyes locked on the horizon, their hearts afire with a reckless abandon, behind the wheel, their very inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the unsuspecting world. The statistics are stark, a grim testament to the carnage they sow: the National Institutes of Health reveal a truth that should shake the very foundations of our collective conscience – the teenage brain, still unfolding like a lotus flower, is not yet ready to navigate the treacherous waters of driving.\n\nInexperience, a woeful lack of wisdom, and a propensity for the thrill of the unknown, a maelstrom of factors that conspire against the young and the innocent. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has sounded the alarm, its findings a clarion call to action: the age of the passenger is directly correlated to the number of accidents on the road. The correlation is a noose, tightening around the neck of our youth, a noose that can be loosened only by a concerted effort to address the root cause of this scourge.\n\nThe provisional driver's licenses, a Band-Aid solution, a temporary fix for a problem that runs far deeper. We are fooling ourselves, deluding ourselves into thinking that by restricting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers, we are somehow mitigating the risks. But we are not. The issue is not the license, it is the individual, the young driver, still a leaf blown about by the winds of whim and folly.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage of the human psyche, has warned us of the dangers of issuing driver's licenses to those under the age of 19-20. His research speaks of a primal urge, a desire to take risks for the sheer exhilaration of it all. We are tempting fate, tempting the gods, by allowing these young drivers to take the wheel. We are courting disaster, inviting the specter of death to join us on the roads.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not revolutionary, merely a return to sanity, a recognition of the fact that our young drivers are not yet ready for the responsibilities that come with the keys to a car. Schools can continue to provide the educational foundation, but until the age of 18, the roads must remain closed to them. A provisional permit can still be issued, but only after a rigorous training program, one that includes a minimum of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. This is not a novel idea, merely a common-sense solution to a problem that has been festering for far too long.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better. The lives of our young people depend on it. The ghosts of the road, the specter of death, will not be silenced until we take action. We must act, we must legislate, and we must protect our youth from the dangers that lurk on the roads, dangers that are as much a product of their own inexperience as they are of our own negligence.",
            "Deep within the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's labyrinthine repository of early Edison films, I chanced upon a cache of trick films, fifteen in total, from the halcyon days of 1895 to the nascent years of 1901. These cinematic conjurings, forged in the crucible of creative editing, danced on the precipice of illusion, their poetics waiting to be unraveled like a skein of unraveling thread. My foray into the world of trick films centered on dissecting the underlying principles that governed the majority of these enigmatic motion pictures, while also tracing the evolutionary divergences that distinguished a select few of the later entries.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the heart of the trick film, I discovered a prevailing aesthetic that bound these early cinematic endeavors together. Like a prisoner confined to a narrow cell, the trick film was set-bound, its compositional parameters defined by the strictures of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained rooted in its appointed position, unmoving and unyielding, as if bound to the very spot where the story unfolded. The resulting films, bereft of camera movement, relied on the steadfastness of the proscenium to conjure the illusion of drama and narrative. The adherence to long and medium shots, a direct descendant of the stage and vaudeville traditions, further underscored the static nature of the trick film.\n\nYet, as the years ticked by, a nascent sense of experimentation began to seep into the fabric of trick films. A few bold spirits, unencumbered by the strictures of convention, dared to challenge the status quo by introducing innovations such as multiple shots. Like a glimmer of light piercing the darkness, these new techniques hinted at a world beyond the narrow confines of the proscenium.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the trick films, a thread that wove its way through the entirety of the Edison catalog, was their penchant for filming within the confines of an interior set. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained fixed in its proscenium position, a static sentinel guarding the unfolding drama. This composition, born of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, imposed a strict limitation on the movement of figures within the frame. Like puppets on a string, the actors were confined to a narrow axis, their movements restricted to the horizontal plane. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) served as a prime example of this phenomenon, its actors entering from the right side and moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, their exit from the frame occurring without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated the shot length of these early trick films. Like a metronome marking time, the shots tended to be long and, on occasion, medium shots. Close-ups, a staple of modern cinema, were an anomaly in the trick films, their absence a testament to the stage and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, confined to the middle ground, remained steadfast, their faces and actions frozen in time, unmoving and unyielding, like statues in a garden of stone.\n\nThe trick films, bound by the strictures of their one-shot-per-film methodology, were limited in length, their narrative and dramatic potential curtailed by the constraints of their compositional format. Most trick films, akin to vaudeville acts, focused on short, attention-grabbing tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, bereft of narrative depth or dramatic complexity. Yet, even within these limitations, a few trick films, like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), revealed a more nuanced understanding of the medium, their physical shots joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance, a testament to the evolving art of the trick film.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of his mind, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a steadfast sentinel, his convictions a bulwark against the tempests of a world gone mad. A farmer by trade, a politician by chance, he had dedicated his life to the unfettered pursuit of personal freedom and the sanctity of government. The agrarian ideals that had guided his plow had become the lodestar of his life, illuminating the dark recesses of his soul and illuminating the path to a system of government that would preserve the sacred rights of man.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the fetters of tradition, Taylor saw an opportunity to forge a new nation, one where the virtuous and the vicious alike would be tempered by the fire of self-governance. He believed that the natural rights of man, like the seasons, were interdependent – that the denial of one would sow the seeds of discord and wither the harvest of the rest. These rights, like the unyielding roots of a tree, must be shielded from the grasping hands of government.\n\nTaylor's vision was one of a dualistic world, where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were locked in an eternal struggle. He saw government as a reflection of this duality, its virtues and vices born of the same flawed humanity that governed it. A government, he believed, must be founded on the principles of private property, agricultural prosperity, and the curtailment of avarice. Only thus could it ensure that the self-interest that drove humanity would not be the sole arbiter of its actions, but rather a force tempered by the public good.\n\nLike a stubborn oak, Taylor stood firm in his conviction that the Constitution must be interpreted with a strict hand, its words a sacred text that must be read with the intent of its authors in mind. He knew that a government with too much power was like a raging fire, devouring all in its path, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was a recipe for disaster. The Declaration of Independence, with its ringing words of sovereignty and liberty, was to him the true charter of the United States, a beacon that guided him through the treacherous waters of his time.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project - a decline as precipitous as the grey slope of a winter's hill. It was a disheartening turn, a shadow that crept over the landscape of our initiative like a chill wind. The reasons for this downturn were as elusive as the mist that rose from the frozen earth. Perhaps the winter's grip on the campus had begun to tighten, trapping some beneath its icy grip, forcing them to abandon their bicycles and their feet, to succumb to the convenience of wheels and the warmth of their cars. Or maybe the weight of semester's end, the crushing pressure to finish, to grade, to flee, had obscured the log from their minds, a small but vital task lost in the whirlwind of the season. And of course, the holidays, those times of feasting and forgetting, had brought a halt to the project's momentum, as if the very mention of it had been stricken from the collective memory. But December's passing, and January's chill, and still the logs remained sparse, a puzzle that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, we sought to rekindle the flame, to reanimate the initiative. We conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting but fiery spark that flared to life in March, casting a brief but warm glow over our efforts. And lo, the logs began to flow once more, like the gentle thawing of a winter's night. But the question remained: how to sustain this momentum, to keep the project from succumbing to the same forces that had brought it low. For in this world, where freedom and independence and flexibility were the watchwords, where the siren's call of the car was ever-present, it seemed a Sisyphean task to persuade people to abandon their wheels for the uncertain pleasures of alternative transportation.\n\nWe offered incentives, tokens of our appreciation, in the form of gift certificates to the local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores. But were they enough? Would the promise of a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle have been enough to stir the hearts of our commuters, to rouse them from their torpor? We may never know, for the prizes remained constant throughout the project's duration. But it is a tantalizing prospect, a what-if that haunts us still. What if we had announced, in December, the addition of a bicycle, and in January, a hybrid car? Would the logs have flowed more freely, the project's momentum uninterrupted by the hurdles of the holiday season and the semester's end? We can only speculate, lost in the mists of what might have been.",
            "In the desolate expanse of financial markets, a peculiar creature lurked, its essence distilled in the form of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. This creature, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, seemed to embody the very essence of flexibility, trading with the ephemeral ease of a stock on an exchange. It offered the diversification of an index fund and the singular allure of single stock ownership, a siren's call to investors seeking the best of both worlds.\n\nYet, as with all creatures, there existed a price to be paid. The expense ratios of these ETFs, though lower than those of their mutual fund brethren, were a reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can be a double-edged sword. The need to pay a commission on each transaction, a fee that hung over the investor like a specter, served as a constant reminder of the ETF's existence.\n\nLike a wilderness, the ETF IHF sprawled before us, its top 10 holdings a testament to its power and complexity. To navigate this labyrinth, we narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which comprised 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These 10, a subset of the whole, seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's inner workings.\n\nBut to truly comprehend the ETF, we must delve deeper, into the realm of Beta and return. Like the twisting paths of a forestry, the Beta and return calculations wove a complex tapestry, one that revealed a startling truth: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return, a 16% increase, with a Beta that was 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. The siren's call of the ETF, it seemed, was not without its drawbacks.\n\nYet, like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies. The possibility of statistical significance hung over the results like a specter, a reminder that even the most compelling of arguments can be fleeting. To pierce the veil of uncertainty, we turned to the standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's volatility.\n\nThe standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's inner turmoil, hung like a shadow over the results. Normalized to 100%, the accumulated standard deviation of the top 10 stocks seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's fundamental nature. Like the rustling of leaves in an autumnal wind, the results seemed to suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might be the key to unlocking the ETF's true potential.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of financial markets, the ETF IHF remained an enigma, a creature of mystery and intrigue. Its top 10 holdings, a subset of the whole, seemed to hold the key to understanding the ETF's inner workings. But like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies, leaving the question: can a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings truly provide a higher return with a lower Beta? Only time, like the passing of the seasons, would tell.",
            "As if conjured from the darkest recesses of the mind, Dream-Land stood as one of Edgar Allan Poe's most celebrated creations. Yet, it was in the forgotten shards of this work that a hidden thread of influence lay concealed, woven from the very fabric of a bygone era. In lines 6 and 56, Poe wove the enigmatic tapestry of \"Thulé\", a term whose origins unfold like a fable, reaching back to the ancient Virgil. But, like a ghostly presence, it was not the Roman poet alone who bore responsibility for this enigmatic term. Poe's fascination with the German masters, particularly Goethe, lay at the heart of this mystique.\n\nA whispered legacy of influence, Poe's debt to Goethe's works was one that would be echoed by scholars for years to come. Karl J. Arndt, in his erudite tome, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, would unravel the tangled threads of their poetic kinship, leaving no doubt as to the deliberate echoes of the German master. It was as if Poe had set out to craft a dark and twisted doppelganger, a shadowy reflection of Goethe's own creations.\n\nIt was in the somber realm of Faust, that grand and tragic drama penned by Goethe, that the poet would find the seeds of his own \"Thule\". The King of Thule, a poem woven into the fabric of Faust's second part, spoke of a monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his queen, drinking away the bitter memories of their love. As the king's world crumbled, he surrendered to the void, his legacy reduced to the solitary goblet, a potent symbol of his devastation. And so, like a ghostly specter, the King of Thulé haunted the pages of Poe's Dream-Land, a poignant testament to the poet's own struggles with loss and the allure of the abyss.\n\nIn the collected works of Poe, the term \"Thulé\" would reappear, like a recurring nightmare, a haunting refrain that whispered secrets of a world beyond the veil. As in The Pit and the Pendulum, Poe would invoke the echoes of Goethe's creation, weaving a dark and foreboding tapestry of shadows and despair. And in the depths of this abyss, the two poets would meet, their visions entwined like the branches of two twisted trees, their darkness amplified by the silence of the night.\n\nAs Poe navigated the labyrinthine paths of his own creative subconscious, he would find himself drawn to the somber landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where shadows reigned supreme, and the colors of life had long since faded away. In this desolate realm, the speaker of Dream-Land wandered, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, his world shrouded in a perpetual twilight, devoid of hope or solace. It was as if Poe had taken up the mantle of the King of Thulé, his own demons driving him forward, through the treacherous landscape of his own broken heart.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of literary history, Poe and Goethe would meet, their works entwined like the roots of two ancient trees, their darkness and despair a testament to the power of the human imagination. As the ages passed, their legacy would endure, a haunting reminder of the power of art to capture the very essence of our darkest fears and deepest longings. And in the end, it was not the light of knowledge that would guide us, but the shadows of our own lost souls, forever bound to the dark and twisted world of the imagination.",
            "In the court of California, a query arises as to whether a customer, injured by the fall from an applesauce spill in a grocery store, can claim punitive damages from the store's manager, who, after being informed twice of the spill, chose to delay cleaning it for thirty minutes while partaking in a dinner break. A judge, in weighing the merits of this claim, would likely not dismiss it outright. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were motivated by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from their conduct. Moreover, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were despicable, meaning reprehensible and lacking in moral fiber. Jennifer Palmer, the plaintiff in this case, can argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have been aware of the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple instances of slips and falls that had occurred at the store in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose to ignore the hazard, opting instead to enjoy his dinner.\n\nThe plaintiff's contention that Martin's actions were despicable may not be as convincing, yet it remains a reasonable argument, given the recurring slip-and-fall incidents that had plagued the store in 2009, including six reported incidents prior to Palmer's accident. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the spill to Martin's attention, to which he replied with the same dismissive attitude. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of the situation became apparent. \n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were motivated by oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, actions that are despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately chose to ignore them.

            "In the stillness that follows the passage of time, I find myself wandering back to a course I once took on the subject of Islam at CBC.  The fervor of debate that coursed through those discussions still echoes within me.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion continues to gnaw at my mind, its relevance sharpened by the events that have transpired since that fateful day in 2001.  I recall how the media's gaze shifted, like a desert sun, from a harsh scrutiny of Islam to an almost perverse tolerance, a tolerance that was as unyielding as the desert sands.  And yet, in that same era, a figure emerged, a man named Barack Obama, whose family's ties to Islam seemed to hold no significance in the minds of the masses.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, its contradictions a puzzle that refuses to be solved.  The man I thought I knew, the man of fire and steel, who conquered and claimed dominion over tribes, seems to have been supplanted by a figure of quiet humility.  A man who, according to the biography, was a martyr, misunderstood and humbled by the will of others.  And yet, it was this very same man who drew people to him, one by one, as the truth of his words and deeds became clear.  The similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad are striking, but it is the manner in which they are presented that troubles me.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that echoes the bounty of Jesus' own miracles, seems less a demonstration of power and more a testament to Muhammad's willingness to serve.  This is a narrative that belies the truth, for it reduces the grandeur of Jesus' life and teachings to a mere echo of Muhammad's.\n\nThe stories that make up the biography are a tangled web of hearsay and second-hand accounts, each one a thread that weaves a fragile tapestry of truth.  The authors' intention, to provide proof of the 'witness' of Muhammad's message, only serves to undermine the very fabric of the stories themselves.  The further removed from the source, the more suspect the narrative becomes, a fragile reed that bends in the wind of doubt.\n\nBut it is not the stories that bother me most, it is the way in which they seek to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a godly man, humble and wise.  History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of power and ambition, of a man who rose to greatness through force and guile.  And so, I am left to wonder, what do Muslims today know of the truth behind Muhammad's ascension to power?  Does the myth of the humble prophet blind them to the reality of the man who forged their faith?",
            "In the tumultuous expanse of time, a great divergence unfolded, like the gradual darkening of a winter's sky. The teachings of Jesus, born of the earth and the spirit, were soon lost to the ambitious undertow of Christian thought. As the years ebbed and flowed, a tide of doctrine rose, obscuring the original intention of the faith. It was as if the very voice of the divine had been muffled by the murmur of dogma and tradition.\n\nIn the broad sweep of history, a trend became apparent – one of Christianity drifting ever further from its source. The world, it seemed, was moving in a direction opposite to its own. The stalwart and the unwavering, those who clung to the familiar and the known, would resist the tides of change. Yet, their collective voice, though loud, would prove insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nA new awareness, a yearning for the authentic, would stir in the hearts of many. They would seek to peel away the layers of doctrine, to return to the unadorned truth of Jesus' words. This was a process that would take time, perhaps centuries, but it was inevitable. The clock of history would turn backward, and the religion would be reclaimed from the hands of those who had transformed it into a labyrinth of dogma.\n\nAs the trend swept through the lands of the United States and Europe, a profound transformation would unfold. The people would return to the simplicity of Jesus' teachings, unencumbered by the weight of tradition. The once-diverse and fragmented Christian world would become increasingly uniform, like the smooth expanse of a lake on a windless day.\n\nHuman history was replete with examples of such reversals. The once-persecuted Christians, shunned and slaughtered by the Roman Empire, would one day claim dominion over it. The nation, born of slavery, would rise to leadership. And so, too, would the Christian faith, shedding its accumulated layers of doctrine, return to its source.\n\nA crucial aspect of this reversal would be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphor, rather than literal truth. Only by stripping away the encrustations of time and tradition could the essence of the faith be revealed.\n\nLooking back into the depths of history, we find the theological foundation of Christianity – Judaism. The Hebrew scriptures, the perception of a single, divine authority, and the monotheistic creed – all these were in place long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem. Yet, even within Judaism, there was no singular spirit. The people were fractured, divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "The depths of human nature, like a stagnant pool, reveal the stark truth of our kind: a relentless pursuit of self-aggrandizement, a covetousness that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a scathing exposé by Upton Sinclair, lays bare the putrid underbelly of our species, where the baser instincts of greed and avarice hold sway. The masters of industry, those self-proclaimed titans of progress, care not a whit for the ravaged earth, the suffering masses, or the unspeakable indignities inflicted upon them. Theirs is a calculus of profit and loss, a ledger that reckons the worth of human life in the penny-pinching language of the bottom line.\n\nAs Sinclair bares the anatomy of Packingtown, we behold the hideous visage of our own depravity: the factories, those steel monoliths that belch forth their noxious fumes into the very air we breathe, leave in their wake a trail of desolation, a scarred and barren landscape that cries out for redemption. The proprietors and managers, those latter-day Philistines, regard the world with all the compassion of a winter's night, cold, unforgiving, and devoid of mercy.\n\nTheir employees, those toiling masses, are but mere cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and expendable, their lives reduced to a mere statistic in the ledger of progress. The hours are long, the toil is backbreaking, and the pay is meager, but the owners care not a whit, for they are the ones who reap the benefits of their sweat and toil. The unions, those supposed champions of the working class, prove to be little more than parasites, preying upon the very workers they claim to represent.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the stark realization that, in the end, we are not much better than slaves, our lives bound to the whims of those who would exploit us for their own gain. The Jungle is a cold, unforgiving mirror held up to our faces, a reminder that, deep down, we are all but beasts, driven by our baser instincts, our humanity reduced to naught but a distant memory, lost in the black smoke that chokes our cities and our souls.",
            "In the realm of literary craftsmanship, authors employ a multitude of techniques to inscribe their readers with a particular sentiment or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these methods prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, wields a plethora of these techniques with deft precision. He often pairs an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner, imbuing the subject with a certain aura. Sometimes, he assigns meaning to a symbol, only to utilize it for the same purpose with calculated effect. \n\nFitzgerald's utilization of colors is a striking example of this technique. He builds meaning for colors like white and gray, often pairing them together to convey a sense of uniformity. These colors take on a nuanced significance as the novel progresses, with Fitzgerald employing them to evoke a particular sentiment around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white with a sense of uniformity, and gray with a more aged and faded quality, is established early in the novel. He reinforces this meaning through repeated use of both colors in the narrative. The character of Daisy and her acquaintances are often described as \"in white,\" as if it were an inherent trait, a constant in their lives. Nick, too, wears \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, while Tom dons a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Even the landscape itself is not immune to these colors: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work. Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"gray name\" on Nick's timetable or a \"white girlhood\" shared by Jordan and Daisy.\n\nWith sufficient meaning assigned to these colors, Fitzgerald begins to employ them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding certain subjects. This technique is first applied to Daisy, whose appearance in a \"little white roadster\" after an extended absence from the narrative serves to render her a more uniform, less substantial character, a mere object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly to emphasize Daisy's role as a symbol of uniformity, as in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" or her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nIn this way, Fitzgerald masterfully employs color to craft a particular atmosphere around his characters and settings, subtly influencing the reader's perception of the narrative's themes and motifs. His use of white and gray serves as a testament to the power of language in shaping our understanding of the world, and the author's ability to wield this power with precision and effect.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, a land of sun-baked hills and verdant valleys, the earth yields its bounty with a generosity born of a mild and benevolent climate. Here, in the fertile crescent of the East County Southern Foothills, the landowner tills the rich soil, coaxing forth an abundance of succulent delights: plump tomatoes, luscious lemons, emerald greens, and the velvety softness of squash, broccoli, and herbs. The air is heavy with the sweet scent of ripening peaches and the delicate perfume of berries, while the gentle hum of bees as they tend to the honeycombs is a soothing serenade to the land.\n\nYet, in this Eden of plenty, there lies a paradox. Amidst the profusion of life, a fragility exists, a delicate balance that can be shattered by the careless hand. The landowner, aware of this fragility, seeks to walk the fine line between profit and preservation, aware that the allure of organic farming holds both promise and peril. The lure of government programs and lucrative markets beckons, yet the path of conventional farming beckons with its efficiency and scale, leaving the landowner to ponder the intricate dance between the needs of the land and the demands of the market.\n\nIn the scrubby landscape of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, the landowner's parcel of 160 acres stands as a testament to the region's storied past. Once home to the indigenous peoples who walked this land for untold centuries, it was later claimed by the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers of the late 1800s. The original homestead patent that deeded this land to its current steward holds secrets of a bygone era, whispers of a time when the land was a verdant tapestry of grazing lands and woodlots.\n\nIn this crucible of history and ecology, the landowner seeks to forge a new path, one that balances the needs of the market with the imperatives of the land. Drawing inspiration from the nearby Cleveland National Forest and the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the landowner strives to create a haven for the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as the burrowing owls whose numbers are dwindling. In this delicate web of life, the landowner seeks to find a harmony between profit and preservation, aware that the land itself holds the secrets to a sustainable future.\n\nWith each passing season, the landowner tends the land with care and devotion, aware that the gentle whispers of the past hold the key to a future of abundance and vitality. In this arid landscape, where the sun beats down and the soil thirsts for moisture, the landowner seeks to quench its thirst, to bring forth a verdant tapestry of life that will sustain generations to come.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, casting the land in a warm, golden light, the landowner knows that the land holds a secret: that the delicate balance between profit and preservation is not a zero-sum game, but a harmonious marriage of two opposing forces, each one enriching the other in a dance of life and death, of growth and decay. In this crucible of light and shadow, the landowner seeks to find the perfect balance, to create a haven of life in a world of scarcity, where the land itself holds the secrets to a future of abundance and vitality.",
            "The labyrinthine nature of culture lies at the core of any negotiation. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture defies homogeneity, its contours shifting like the sands of a forgotten hourglass. The broad strokes of generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" do little justice to the intricate complexities of a world where nothing is singular or uniform.\n\nWhen traversing the uncharted territories of a foreign culture, one cannot help but be drawn into the realm of the familiar, with comparisons forming like ripples on a still pond. To grasp the essence of a culture, one must delve into its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or altering, but of accepting it for what it is, and navigating its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high and the bargaining position tenuous.\n\nThe dichotomy of national and international cultures is a false one, for within the walls of any given nation, a multitude of corporate cultures thrives. A company's culture can be as stifling as it is liberating, with its own brand of tyranny or utopia. The signs are there, in the dress codes that dictate modesty or audacity, in the communication styles that prioritize directness or subtlety, and in the hiring practices that value talent or pedigree. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork quilt, with companies weaving their own unique narratives from threadbare threads of ingenuity and duplicity. And yet, even within these seemingly monolithic entities, diversity lurks, a subterranean world of conflicting values and interests waiting to be unearthed.\n\nValues, the hidden architecture of culture, hold the key to understanding the why behind a people's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are sacred tenets in a culture, then a negotiator must tread with care, lest they inadvertently offend or disrupt the delicate balance. Conversely, a culture that places its faith in the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by concessions or compromise. To succeed, a negotiator must don the cloak of empathy, learning to see the world through the eyes of their opponent, to grasp the personal stakes that drive them forward. Only then can the labyrinth of culture be navigated, and the art of negotiation mastered.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a lone voice whispers a refrain: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase, an echo of Psalm 14, finds its way into the writings of St. Anselm, a beacon of faith amidst the darkness. It is a notion that also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, a seeker of truth in a world beset by shadow. Both men, in their quest for the divine, weave arguments that dance upon the fringes of reason and faith. Yet, in their zeal to prove the existence of a God, they falter in their grasp of the whole.\n\nLet us begin with St. Anselm's creed, a path that winds inward, seeking answers within the recesses of the soul. He posits that the proof of God's existence lies within the mind's own labyrinth, a realm where truth is forged in the crucible of understanding. The nonexistence of God, to Anselm, is a notion that cannot be conceived, a void that defies the very fabric of our being. In this, he suggests that the search for God is not an external endeavor, but an introspective journey, where the truth lies hidden within the recesses of the self.\n\nThis notion of faith, a reliance on the unseen, is a thread that weaves through Christian texts, a testament to the power of the human spirit. Yet, it is a concept that stands in stark contrast to the rationalist's creed, that of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas, driven by a desire to prove the existence of God through the lens of reason, presents five arguments that seek to pierce the veil of uncertainty. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each a stepping stone on the path to the divine.\n\nIn this, Aquinas seeks to persuade, to convince the doubter that the existence of God is not a matter of faith, but of logic. The missing piece of the puzzle, though unseen, can be inferred through the careful assembly of the rest. Yet, in their pursuit of the divine, both men falter, their arguments incomplete, their understanding of the whole imperfect. Like two travelers lost in a wilderness, they strain to see beyond the horizon, yet the truth eludes them, a mirage on the horizon of the human condition.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a figure emerged, one who would come to be known as the Buddha. His birth, a mere whisper in the annals of the past, a faint tremor in the sands of the forgotten. A prince, a wanderer, a seeker of truth. The world, a labyrinth of suffering, of desire, of hatred, of delusion. He roamed, a pilgrim in a world bereft of solace, until he found the path. The path of the Buddha, a narrow, winding road that led to the precipice of enlightenment.\n\nTime, a merciless taskmaster, wore down the rough edges of the world, leaving in its wake the smooth, weathered stones of tradition. Theravada Buddhism, the most austere of the Buddha's teachings, a sect born of the fires of the past, tempered by the hammer of the ages. In the crucible of time, the religion was purified, its core doctrine burning bright like a coal in the darkness.\n\nIn the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony was observed, a water-cutting celebration, a ritual born not of the Buddha's teachings, but of the necessities of the world. Monks and laymen alike participated, their footsteps echoing through the empty streets, a distant memory of a forgotten past. The ceremony, a thin thread in the tapestry of tradition, a reminder that the Buddha's teachings were but a starting point, a foundation upon which the edifice of the religion was built.\n\nForces, both internal and external, hostile and benign, shaped the course of the religion. The internal forces, born of the members of the Buddhasasana, a community of seekers, of monks and laymen, who struggled to maintain the purity of the doctrine. The external forces, a maelstrom of influences, a tide of ideas, of cultures, of histories, that threatened to engulf the fragile flower of the faith.\n\nIn the depths of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist text, lay the core of the religion. The Sutta Pitaka, a collection of sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, a codex of disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a treatise on the metaphysical components of the faith. Anatta, the doctrine of no soul, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, these were the building blocks of the religion.\n\nThe four noble truths, the foundation of the Buddha's teachings, a simple, yet profound, doctrine. Dukkha, the truth of suffering, the second truth, that attachment causes suffering, and the third, that suffering can be overcome. The path to enlightenment, a winding road, fraught with peril, yet beset on all sides by the siren call of desire, of hatred, of delusion.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, in the darkness of the forest, the Buddha's words echoed through the ages, a call to the seeker, a whispered promise of liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. The Theravada community, a fragile, flickering flame, threatened by the winds of time, yet burning brightly, a beacon in the darkness, a testament to the power of the Buddha's teachings.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a struggle unfolded between two nations, the United States and Mexico. Their enduring enmity, forged in the depths of history, spanned 57 years, a prolonged and arduous test of wills. The tumultuous saga of their rivalry reached its zenith in the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the landscape and left an indelible mark on the American Southwest. The echoes of that war still resonated long after its conclusion, casting a pall of animosity over the shared borders of the two nations.\n\nA maelstrom of competing interests, fueled by clashing values and traditions, had set the stage for this rivalry. The divide between the two nations was further exacerbated by the incompatibility of their material pursuits, a chasm that seemed insurmountable. The stakes were high, and the tension between the two nations was palpable, a powder keg waiting to be ignited.\n\nLike the rusting hulks of abandoned ships, other nations had been shipwrecked on the rocky shores of history, their once-promising relationships reduced to nothing more than a distant memory. The United States and Mexico, however, were not so fortunate, their tumultuous past a constant reminder of the perils of animosity. David M. Pletcher's words, etched in the annals of history, served as a stark reminder: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The proximity of these nations to the United States only served to heighten the sense of unease, a constant reminder of the fragility of their relations.\n\nThe bitter pill of religious intolerance had poisoned the well of their diplomacy, a festering wound that refused to heal. Sally Frahm's words, a poignant reminder of the past, echoed through the ages: \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm that yawned between the two nations was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, a testament to the enduring power of dogma.\n\nThe legacy of distrust, inherited from their colonial past, weighed heavily upon the two nations, a millstone that threatened to engulf them both. The weight of their shared history, a burden they could not shake, had sapped the life from their relations, leaving only a husk of what once was. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by their rivalry, served as a testament to the enduring power of their animosity.\n\nAs the years passed, the rivalry finally began to subside, its embers slowly extinguished by the gentle rains of time. Mexico's dependence on the United States had become a fait accompli, a reality that could no longer be denied. Schmitt's words, a cold comfort to those who had lived through the tumult, served as a reminder that even the most intractable of conflicts can eventually come to an end: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (Schmitt 1974, p. 109). The rivalry, once a burning fire that had threatened to consume them both, had finally been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.",
            "Fifteen years of desolation had ravaged my body, a silence where once there was strength. It began without warning, an unwelcome guest that would not depart. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the vulnerable, a sentinel of the sick. The promise of security had drawn me to this vocation, a shield against the tempests of my own childhood. My heart had whispered to me in the darkness: \"You will always find a place to stand, a roof to shelter beneath.\" And so I chose the path of the healer, though my true desires had lain elsewhere.\n\nThe scientist, the journalist – these were the voices that had whispered in my ear, urging me to explore the unknown, to seek the truth. But I had silenced them, taming the wild within. Fifteen years of living on the frayed threads of Social Security Disability had stripped me bare, leaving naught but the echoes of what once was. Every day a struggle, a battle against the void that yawned within. My family, my friends – they had been my lifeline, my fragile thread of hope in the darkness. And when disaster struck, it was not the strength of my own heart that saw me through, but the kindness of those who stood beside me.\n\nThis, I have come to understand, is the truth of the human condition. We are not islands, unmoored and alone. We are a tapestry, intricately woven, each strand connected to the next. And when the storms of life assail us, it is not our individual fortitude that will see us through, but the bonds we have forged with one another.\n\nI do not advocate for the rejection of preparedness. A disaster kit, a first aid kit, a cache of supplies – these are wise preparations for the uncertainties of life. But let us not forget the most essential resource of all: the human heart. Let us not confuse self-reliance with the cold, hard stone of isolation. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the Rockies, but the warmth of community, the generosity of strangers, and the love that bound them together.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Stockpile your supplies, hone your skills, and learn to tend the fire of compassion within yourself. But as you do, also tend the fires of connection that bind us all. For when the darkness closes in, it is not our individual candles that will light the way, but the collective flame of our shared humanity.",
            "In the dark of the universe, a question lingers, a whispered query that echoes through the void: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, hidden shackles that govern the direction of change? It is a question that has haunted the minds of scholars for centuries, a puzzle that has resisted the efforts of even the most brilliant minds. As D'Arcy Thompson once said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so we find ourselves in a similar predicament, struggling to grasp the intricacies of life's unfolding tapestry.\n\nBut it is in the realm of mollusks, those creatures of the ancient earth, that we may find a glimpse of the answers we seek. Through the lens of mathematical modeling, we have endeavored to unravel the mysteries of Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep. Our study, a testament to the power of human ingenuity, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern evolution's pace, that subtle dance of life and death.\n\nWe began by delving into the realm of X-radiography, that wondrous tool that reveals the hidden truths of the shell. Like a mapmaker charting the unseen territories of a new world, we sought to delineate the parameters that govern the shell's morphology. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into the fabric of our mathematical model, CerioShell. With this tool, we crafted hypothetical scenarios, possibilities that danced like specters in the void, waiting to be interpreted.\n\nAnd so we turned to the shell, that most ancient and enigmatic of forms. A tube that traverses the realm of time, a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each revolution, each turn of the shell, a whorl that spirals around the central axis, the columella. A continuous line, a suture, separates each whorl, a boundary that marks the passage of time. And at the apex of this spiral, the largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel, a testament to the shell's enduring presence.\n\nWe may view the shell from different perspectives, apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a window into the secrets of the shell's structure. And it is here, in the realm of the aperture, that we find the key to understanding the shell's trajectory, its path through time and space.\n\nLike a thread unwinding from a spool, the aperture travels through the ages, a series of coordinates that chart the shell's growth. And it is this trajectory that we have sought to graphically and mathematically represent, a dance of numbers and lines that reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nBut our work is far from over. For in the realm of the shell, we find not only the secrets of the past, but also the keys to the future. And so we continue to modify the parameters, to vary the variables, to see how the shell's skeletogenesis responds to the whims of chance and necessity. In this grand experiment, we are but mere players, instruments of a greater design, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe, one shell at a time.",
            "In the vast expanse of Indonesia's landscape, a quiet crisis simmers, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of the nation's health. The rates of neonatal and infant mortality, a bloody stain on the otherwise hopeful narrative of development, remain stubbornly static, refusing to yield to the ceaseless push of progress. Like a withered vine, they cling to the soil, a testament to the entrenched problems that plague the country's maternal and child health. The Millennium Development Goals, once a beacon of hope, now seem an unattainable dream, their targets slipping further and further from grasp.\n\nA glimmer of light flickers in the darkness, a 72% of births attended by skilled health workers, a number that masks the truth, for it includes traditional practitioners, unprepared to face the complications that can arise. The numbers whisper sweet nothings of improvement, but the reality is far more dire, with maternal deaths claiming their victims like a merciless harvest. The statistics on diarrheal cases in children under five, a grim reminder of the unforgiving power of disease, tell a tale of neglect and abandonment.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a frail reed, bends before the wind, a paltry 4%, a stark reminder of the inadequacies of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The urban-rural divide, a chasm that yawns wide and deep, reveals the ugly truth of unequal access to care, a reflection of a system that favors the fortunate few, while condemning the many to the cold, unforgiving darkness of neglect. The vertical equity gap, a precipice that threatens to swallow all, stands at 27%, a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by the poor in accessing the very services that could save their lives.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the specter of neonatal and maternal mortality, the question hangs in the air like a challenge, how to bridge the yawning chasm of care. Shall Indonesia succumb to the siren song of programmatic approaches, targeting specific sectors, or shall it strive to strengthen the very foundations of its health system, a stone upon stone, a pyramid of care that reaches up to the heavens? The siren's call is seductive, promising quick fixes and tangible results, but at what cost? The drawbacks are legion, a hydra-like monster that devours resources, siphons talent, and spawns duplication and disarray.\n\nIn the end, the choice is not a simple one, a binary decision between two paths, but a labyrinthine puzzle that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to confront the darkness that lies at the heart of Indonesia's health crisis. The journey ahead will be long and arduous, but it is a journey that must be taken, for the sake of the children, the mothers, and the very soul of the nation.",
            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the Victorian era, a peculiar dichotomy emerged – novels that eschewed the traditional trappings of the aristocracy and instead delved into the depths of the human experience. Two such outliers are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, novels that defied convention with their enthralling mysteries and unflinching portrayals of the bizarre. Like twisted threads, these novels wove intricate narratives that probed the innermost recesses of their characters, casting a flickering light on their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the protagonist navigated the treacherous landscape of his own mind, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred. The cacophony of his thoughts grew louder, an unrelenting maelstrom of emotions and ideas that threatened to consume him whole. The words of Sikes and Crackit still lingered in his mind, their acrimonious dispute lingering like a ghostly presence. He stumbled backward, shocked by the report of firearms, as the world around him dissolved into chaos – lights blurring, sounds jarring, and an unseen force propelling him forward.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, an unspoken awareness of pain seared his consciousness, an unrelenting torment that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employed this technique of mystery to illuminate the inner workings of their characters. Through dream sequences and states of altered consciousness, these novels plumbed the depths of their subjects, revealing the hidden recesses of their psyches. In Oliver Twist, these dreamlike episodes served as a window into Oliver's inner world, a realm where his deepest fears and insecurities lay bare.\n\nThe shooting of Oliver Twist, revisited in chapter 28, served as a catalyst for this narrative. As Oliver relived the event, his senses numbed by the trauma, he struggled to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. The unseen hand that bore him away was a potent symbol of his loss of control, a stark reminder that he was powerless to shape his own destiny. The perpetual pain that gnawed at his consciousness served as a constant reminder of his vulnerability, a vulnerability that had been exploited by the forces of darkness that surrounded him.\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming despair, the question arose – whose will had brought about his downfall? Was it his own, or the machinations of those who sought to control him? The shooting served as a testament to Oliver's growing sense of defeat, a defeat that had been insidiously insinuated by the forces of oppression that had worn him down.\n\nAs the darkness closed in, the world seemed to shrink, its boundaries compressing into an endless expanse of silence and desolation. The passing of time became a distant memory, a fleeting whisper in the void. And in this void, the characters of these novels struggled to find meaning, their lives reduced to a series of fragmented moments, suspended in the eternal twilight of uncertainty.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of the human experience, these novels stood as beacons of hope, illuminating the darkest recesses of the human heart. They dared to venture into the unknown, to confront the mysteries that lay beyond the boundaries of conventional narrative. And in doing so, they created works of profound beauty, works that continue to haunt us to this day.",
            "The shadows crept across the worn linoleum of the after-school program, a faint reminder of the day's passage. I had worked there, tutoring the younger ones, my strength lying in the realm of English and the written word. The boy, Adrian, a third or fourth grader, had been assigned to me, his struggles with reading a puzzle I sought to unravel. It started with the alphabets, the letters that danced upon the page, yet to him, a riddle. He would pronounce some with ease, while others defied him, a stark contrast that left me perplexed. His mother, a woman of unspoken words, entered our world one fateful day, her silence a testament to the language barrier that stood between us. Our communication, a halting dance of gestures and broken phrases.\n\nThe truth dawned on me like a winter's dawn, a slow and gradual realization: Adrian's struggles lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet. His proficiency in speech, a spoken language, belied his struggle with the written word. Though he spoke English with clarity, the written form eluded him. In that moment, I grasped the complexity of the issue, a problem that persisted long after our meetings.\n\nThat tale I recount, a testament to the unseen struggles of the language barrier, particularly in the state of California. It is a problem that defies easy solutions, a tangled web of complexities that require a multifaceted approach. In Adrian's case, the answer lay in targeted tutoring, a concentrated effort to teach him the English alphabet and pronunciation. Yet, for those who barely speak the language, the solution proves far more elusive.\n\nThe dual language system, a concept often met with skepticism, holds promise. Not limited to children of Spanish descent, it benefits all, as studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Fears of wasted resources and limited benefits are unfounded. If implemented as a standard, rather than an exception, all children would reap its rewards. But how to achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, a daunting expectation. However, the presence of bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever one may call them, is a reasonable and realistic solution.\n\nIn the end, the answer lies not in a single approach, but in a fusion of methods, a harmonious blend of ESL classes, private tutors, and mainstream immersion. It is a challenge that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to adapt. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, can be bridged, but it demands a collective effort, a shared understanding that the solutions lie not in isolation, but in cooperation.",
            "In the earliest of hours, we are fed a notion that there is a vastness beyond our own, a reality that defies comprehension.  Some are schooled in its presence, others seek it within the confines of their own minds, and still, others reject its very existence. The paths we choose are as varied as the stars that fill the night sky. We seek a beacon to guide us through the shadows, a light to lead us into the warmth of the sun.\n\nMy father's voice cut through the rain pounding the tin roof of our porch like a dirge. He stared out into the gray, his eyes a mix of longing and remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his frame like a specter. His hair, once a rich abundance, now thinned and sparse. I felt a cold dread, a weight that pressed upon my chest. Our conversation hung in the air like the rain, heavy with unspoken words. I reached out, my arms wrapping around him, a futile attempt to hold onto the man who was slipping away from me. We sat in silence, our eyes fixed on the rain, the sound a cadence that echoed through my mind.\n\nFive days after my twenty-second birthday, he was gone. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but not eased it. I had not been present for his passing. I could not bear to witness the end of the man who had given me life. Instead, I remembered him by the laughter, the stories, the love. The thought of a God who would allow such a fate was a cruel joke. I did not pray in the darkness, for I knew He had stopped listening long ago.\n\nIn the days that followed, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news that would come. The silence was deafening. No one called. It was as if the world had moved on, leaving me behind. I lay there, lost in the shadows, my heart heavy with grief.",
            "In a paradoxical marriage of the antique and the modern, the Gothic Novel emerges, an oxymoronic fusion of the bygone and the new. Ian Watt aptly describes it as a \"Gothic Novel\" - an antithesis of the novel's own rising ascendancy (Watt). Blasted by scorn and praise, the Gothic mode is accused of vacuity and lauded for its ability to conjure an aura of the terrible sublime (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, brokers a union of the archaic and the novelistic, forging a new literary discourse. Walpole weaves together venerable theatrical elements and the artificial simulation of nature, yielding what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, a palimpsest of medieval theatricality, architecture, and tradition, is replete with throwbacks to a bygone era. Even in the era of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the word \"Gothic\" was a catch-all term, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was regarded as a relic of a bygone age, a fossil of a more unsophisticated time. The confluence of the Gothic's theatrical leanings and the novel's novelistic innovations allowed it to endure, even as it became anachronistic, a relic of a bygone era, yet simultaneously novel and fresh to a reader dislocated from the original text.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic Novel lies the concept of Chivalry, an abstraction of medieval valor, which is both retained and transmuted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the catechism of the virtuous knight, is a lodestar for Gothic writers, a beacon of honor, valor, and competence in a world perceived as morally bankrupt (Walpole). Through the prism of Chivalry, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the nascent Romantic movement. Walpole, a man beset by the troubles of his time, wrote The Castle of Otranto as a cri de coeur, a lament for the lost virtues of a bygone era. His writing is a cri de coeur, a plea for the rediscovery of the nobility and integrity that he perceived as having been lost in the mire of his contemporaries. In Frederic, Walpole crafts a character who embodies the chivalric ideal. His description is a litany of traditional chivalric tropes: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a knight, beset by the vicissitudes of fate. The figure of the gallant and courteous knight is, of course, an exaggeration, a trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "In the desolate wasteland of commerce, where the wind howls like a mournful cry, supply chain management emerges as a behemoth, a behemoth born from the fertile soil of necessity. Its genesis dates back to 1982, when Keith Oliver, a sage of industry, first coined the term. Like a prophet proclaiming the arrival of a new era, Oliver described the grand symphony of processes that unfold from customer order to raw materials, production, and distribution. The aim: to satiate the void of customer needs with an efficiency that borders on the efficient.\n\nSix pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce wield these pillars to conjure a symphony of customer satisfaction. But what is production, the first and most vital of these pillars? Production is the foundation, the bedrock upon which the entire edifice stands. It is the time, place, and manner in which goods are brought forth. Only by listening to the whispers of the market can managers divine the desires of the customer. The market, a fickle mistress, beckons the manager to decipher its secrets, to unravel the mysteries of demand. And once the veil is lifted, the manager must decide what products to birth, how many to produce, and where and when to birth them. The production stage is a delicate waltz, a dance of schedules and equipment maintenance, a ballet of precision and detail.\n\nBut the rhythm of production is not the only beat in this grand symphony. Supply, the second pillar, is a symphony of strategic decisions, a harmonious union of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Like a master conductor, the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product, and when to outsource, to create a melody of velocity – a symphony of quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn the retail temples of Wal-Mart and Target, the design of production, inventory, and logistics is a testament to the power of well-crafted processes. Like a well-planned ritual, every step is choreographed to minimize confusion and maximize efficiency. And thus, the supply chain management, this grand symphony, unfolds, a majestic dance of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, all orchestrated to satiate the customer's insatiable hunger.",
            "A faded sign stood crookedly in the dusty air, a weathered piece of cardboard held aloft by an unseen hand. Ellen Page, a star of a world now long gone, stood isolated on a forgotten street, her eyes cast down at the scribbled message scrawled upon her makeshift placard. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the letters stark and black against the pale canvas. Burma, a land shrouded in an aura of oppression, a Southeastern Asian nation ruled by a regime of unforgiving steel. The year was some distant past, a time when protests raged like wildfires, when monks in rust-colored robes marched through the streets, their chanting a call to arms against the iron fist of the military junta.\n\nIt was a time of blood and fire, of screams in the darkness and the scent of smoke. The monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, now walked the thin line between peace and anarchy. The government, its grip on power like a vice, squeezed tighter with each passing day. Foreign journalists, witnesses to the carnage, were rounded up and cast into the depths of some forsaken prison. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell to the ground, his life extinguished by a single bullet, simply for bearing witness to the chaos.\n\nBut Burma was not an isolated case. Throughout the ages, governments had sought to snuff out dissent, to maintain their hold on the masses. The early Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, ruled with an iron fist, their decrees absolute and unyielding. The Japanese emperors, deities in a land of rising suns, claimed divine right to lead their people to prosperity, even as they walked the thin line between life and death. And in a world far removed from these distant lands, a leader, a man of power and influence, held weekly conference calls with a self-proclaimed prophet, a man who spoke of a world divided, a world of the faithful and the damned.\n\nTiananmen Square, a place of blood and memory, echoed with the whispers of the past. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students, bound together by a shared desire for freedom, stood united against the crushing weight of their oppressors. The death toll was a number shrouded in mystery, a figure that danced between 200 and 3,000, a statistic that only served to fuel the fires of outrage. The Rwandan genocide, a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, left a trail of death and despair in its wake, a reminder that the human heart is capable of atrocities beyond comprehension.\n\nAnd Hitler's Third Reich, a monstrosity of a bygone era, stood as a testament to the darkest corners of the human soul. A time of unspeakable horrors, of gas chambers and crematoria, of children orphaned and women widowed, a time when the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder.\n\nThe world had changed, yet the cycle of oppression remained. The faces and places changed, but the story remained the same. And on this forgotten street, this forgotten sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" stood as a grim reminder of a world forever trapped in the cycle of blood and fire.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington's legacy stretches far across the expanse of jazz, a testament to his unyielding vitality and creative might. Like a river that refuses to be stilled, Ellington's artistry flowed on through the years, shaping the contours of his orchestra and birthing works that would come to define the genre. Though his presence at the piano was often understated, Ellington's compositional prowess knew no bounds, as he wove intricate patterns that allowed his musicians to unfurl their talents like a blooming flower.\n\nA master craftsman, Ellington constructed the framework upon which his soloists could improvise, their notes dancing like leaves on a autumn breeze. He penned phrases that coaxed the unique timbres of each band member to the fore, blending them into a harmonious whole that was greater than the sum of its parts. In doing so, he conjured sounds that were both original and timeless, a testament to his profound understanding of the orchestra's sonic tapestry.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, a notion first glimpsed in the haunting Creole Love Call. This early masterpiece, a slow and deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's predilection for using the human voice as a textural element, untethered from the shackles of lyrics. Within its six choruses, we find a testament to Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait that would come to define his oeuvre.\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue of sorts, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice unfolding like a morning mist, growing rougher towards the end like the first wisps of dawn.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo, its notes spinning out like the threads of a spider's web, as it elaborates on the basic melody and stretches towards the fringes of sound.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo, soaring like a bird set free, backed by a subtle piano phrase that weaves in and out of the shadows.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, the brass and reed sections trading call and response like the ebb and flow of a river.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, the reeds take center stage, their call and response unfolding like a great tapestry, as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus, the voice now taking on the growl of a distant dog, soloing like an instrumental virtuoso.\nTag: A final, fleeting tag, a vocal run and a dissonant trombone phrase that hangs in the air like the last wisps of a departing storm.\n\nEllington's predilection for using voice as a dimensional element is but one aspect of his stylistic hallmarks, a thread that weaves its way through his oeuvre like a river through the earth. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, as \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response that is at once both vocal and instrumental. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), with its wondrous trombone introduction by Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, extends these ideas, illuminating the complex interplay between texture, tone, and rhythm that define Ellington's greatest works.",
            "She felt a hollowness within her, an ache that gnawed at the marrow of her soul. It had begun to manifest when she was but a girl, around the age of fourteen, as her world began to unravel with the tangles of adolescence. The feeling persisted, a stubborn ember that refused to be extinguished, even as the years passed and she entered the threshold of womanhood at seventeen. Her desire had grown from an abstract longing to a yearning for something - or someone - tangible, yet she found herself immune to the entreaties of boys who sought to woo her. Their clumsy advances only served to confound her, leaving her to ponder the enigma of her own heart. Theories sprouted like weeds in her mind, but none offered a satisfying explanation for this peculiarity. And so she wandered, a stranger in her own skin, questioning the depths of her own desires.\n\nAt home, her days were typically a tranquil affair. Her parents, a paragon of calm, rarely raised their voices, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. Their disagreements, when they did arise, centered on her defiant individuality, a spirit that seemed to thrive on the energies of her parents' serenity. But today was different. As she roamed the house, seeking inspiration from the void within, a shrill cry pierced the air, followed by her mother's anguished voice. She sprinted toward the kitchen, a sense of trepidation building in her chest. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice cracking with concern. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, the words tumbling from her lips in short, labored breaths. \"Ow... sweet... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother's words were laced with desperation, and her daughter's heart swelled with a sense of duty. With a Herculean effort, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradling her in her arms, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's sterile corridors and antiseptic smells assaulted her senses, but her mind was consumed by worry for her mother. She hastened to the reception area, her voice rising above the din of the hospital, calling out for assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around, and a doctor swiftly arrived to escort her mother to a bed. As the medical staff tended to her mother's wounds, she was left to sit, her anxiety simmering like a pot about to boil over.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "In a desolate expanse of time, a study unfolded like a parched and withered leaf, tracing the enigmatic thread of fate that binds the adherents of the Mediterranean Diet to a diminished risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" a variant of the revered Med diet, unfolded its mysteries, a tapestry woven from the threads of higher plant food consumption, monounsaturated fat, and fish, against the somber backdrop of reduced animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in alcohol was permitted, a fleeting respite from the unyielding strictures of the diet.\n\nEpidemiological endeavors past had whispered promises of an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. Intervention trials had proven the diet's efficacy in guiding obese individuals toward weight loss and a more favorable ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the realm of stroke and stroke mortality remained uncharted, a siren's call to the present study.\n\nWithin the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, and without the blight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were drawn into the orbit of this study. Six epochs, spanning 20 years, witnessed the computation of an aMed diet score, culled from the self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) that chronicled the participants' nutrient intake over the preceding year. The majority of these nurses persisted in their participation, an unbroken thread of commitment.\n\nThese FFQs, subject to validation studies, were the keys to unlocking the secrets of the diet's efficacy. Reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were cross-checked against medical records, hospital documents, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, representing a small fraction of the total strokes and myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986. To mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and to reflect the long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were computed, averaging the scores from two preceding years.\n\nThe confounders, those insidious factors that could subvert the results, were accounted for by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical incantation, was employed to chart the association between the aMed score and the risks of chronic heart disease and stroke, distinguishing between fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The outcome was a revelation: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The passage of 20 years bore witness to 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, with a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In the depths of a nation, a wound festered, its putrid flesh spilling forth a stench that would one day engulf all. The year was 2007, a time when the very fabric of America's economy began to unravel. The once-mighty edifice of financial prowess came crashing down, leaving in its wake a desolate expanse of shattered dreams and broken lives. The question lingers: what calamity befell this behemoth, this leviathan of industry and progress?\n\nA closer examination reveals the genesis of this devastation: the reckless and shortsighted dealings of those who wielded power. Banks and corporations, driven by avarice and a fervent desire for growth, were goaded into issuing sub-prime loans, flooding the market with toxic debt that would eventually poison the very arteries of the economy. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those twin titans of the financial world, were coerced into buying and repackaging these defective mortgages, creating an intricate web of CDOs and CDSs that would ensnare the entire nation.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the fertile soil of the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. The stage was thus set for the impending disaster, a catastrophe that would unfold seven years later like a slow-motion train wreck. As the New York Times' Steven Holmes astutely observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes' prophetic words would come to haunt the nation, as the government-subsidized corporation careened towards the abyss, threatening a repeat of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\n\nA complex tapestry of factors contributed to the unraveling of the economy, including the proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial alchemy concoctions intertwined the nation's economy, ensnaring households and financial markets alike in a web of debt that would prove as fragile as spun sugar. The result was a nation awash in leverage, its citizens and financial institutions perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable happened: the housing bubble burst, releasing a torrent of toxic waste that drowned the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The once-mighty Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, submitting to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were crippled by a $5 trillion mortgage debt, their fate sealed when they were placed under government control in September 2008.\n\nAs the nation struggled to come to terms with the devastation, a haunting question lingered: how could so many have been so blind to the perils of their own creations? How could the very instruments of progress have been twisted into instruments of destruction? The answer, like the nation itself, was complex, multifaceted, and ultimately, heartbreaking.",
            "He'd sat at his desk, hands clasped together as if in prayer, staring at the blank page before him. The dim fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in tandem with the flashes of self-doubt that coursed through his mind. Ah, the siren song of exposition, beckoning him toward the shoals of tedious prose. He knew the drill, the faint whisper in his ear that urged him to reveal the entire backstory of his characters, to dump the history into the reader's lap like a laundry basket overflowing with dirty socks.\n\nBut he knew better. He knew that exposition, like the devil on his shoulder, was a temptress, promising a shortcut through the woods of storytelling. He'd see authors fall prey to her wiles, their narratives bogged down in a sea of unnecessary details, their readers fleeing in search of more engaging fare. Dr. Merlin, his instructor, had once shouted at her monitor, no doubt, when she found herself stuck in a quagmire of Too Much Information.\n\nAnd so he took a deep breath, forced his mind to focus, and wrote. \"Show, don't tell,\" he reminded himself, a mantra he'd learned long ago. He wrote a sentence, then another, and another, each one a small, incremental step forward in the story. He didn't tell the reader about the character's past; he showed it through the curve of a smile, the glint in the eye, the way the character's hands moved with a practiced ease.\n\nAs he wrote, the words began to flow, a gentle stream that wound its way through the story, carrying the reader along with it. He wrote of the character's first meeting with the heroine, the way their eyes met across the crowded room, the way their hands touched, sending a spark of electricity through the air. He didn't tell the reader about their romance; he showed it in the way they laughed together, the way they held each other close.\n\nAnd when the character's husband was killed, the reader felt the loss deeply, not just because of the fact of his death, but because of the way it had changed the heroine, the way it had revealed her true character. The reader mourned with her, and in doing so, was drawn deeper into the story, more invested in the heroine's journey.\n\nExposition, he knew, was a necessary evil, a way to provide context, to give the reader a sense of the world the story is set in. But it was a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk. Too much, and the reader would nod off, the story lost in a sea of unnecessary details. Too little, and the reader would be left in the dark, struggling to make sense of the narrative.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He'd walked the tightrope, and come out on the other side, the words flowing smoothly, the story unfolding like a river. Exposition, he knew, was not his enemy, but a tool, a means to an end. And with practice, he knew he could learn to wield it with precision, to show, not tell, and keep his readers enthralled.",
            "He sat and watched the flickering images, the news broadcasts from a place called Columbus, Ohio. The first one, a live feed, was from a station called NBC 4, on a day that felt like a hundred years gone, August 13, 2011. The lead story was a man, a Shad Hostettler, who had committed a heinous act. He was shown in a picture, his face twisted, his eyes sunken, a visage of pure malevolence. The story was brief, a mere two minutes, as if the weight of it was too much to bear. They spoke of wounds, multiple, inflicted by the man's own hand, and of his subsequent arrest. It was a fleeting glimpse, a momentary glance into the abyss.\n\nThe next story was a haze of silence, a void where a young man's life hung in the balance. Travis Buyers, 18, lay critically injured, a victim of a senseless act of violence. The words swirled, a vortex of confusion, as the SWAT team combed through the streets, searching for answers. But the faces that stared back, the ones that mattered, were the ones that were ignored, the ones that were left to fade into the background. It was a tale of a different kind of violence, one that was all too familiar, a story of lives left unspoken.\n\nThe broadcasts stumbled onward, a jarring sequence of images and words. A helicopter, its metal shattered, a victim of a lone gunman. A .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss. The reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, a pitiful sum for a life. The next story, a tease, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reminder that the world outside was still turning, still spinning out of control.\n\nAnd then, the focus shifted, the lens narrowing to a single, dark-skinned man, a thief in the night, a robber of a store. The words dripped with venom, a racist's venom, a poison that seeped into the very fabric of the broadcast. The man's height, his weight, his skin color, a litany of details, a litany of hate.\n\nA convicted man, a Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin, a dealer in death. The words flowed, a river of steel, a river of stone. Twenty-five years, 300 months, a sentence, a fate, a life, a life sentence. His skin, a shade of brown, a color, a label, a box to be checked. It was a story, a tale of a man, a man with a name, a man with a face, a man with a story that was left untold.\n\nHe sat, a prisoner of the screen, a prisoner of the words, a prisoner of the world. The images faded, the words dissolved, and he was left with a sense of despair, a sense of hopelessness. The world outside was a dark and twisted place, a place where lives were cheap, where stories were told, and where the faces of the forgotten were forever lost in the shadows.",
            "A bond of fraternal tethering binds two souls together - an unbreakable, irrevocable cord that weaves through the labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It is a bond that reveals itself in the most dire of circumstances, when the true nature of this tie is laid bare, be it born of good or evil. The emotions that simmer beneath its surface carry with them a heavy cost, one that is paid in full when the consequences of these feelings are confronted. It is in the depths of this bond that one can gaze into the eyes of a brother and behold one's own reflection, unencumbered by the perceptions of others. There, in the actions and the weight of those actions, lies the true characterization of a man.\n\nIn the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a forlorn journey through a landscape both lush and desolate. Their path is fraught with bitter disappointment and intense pride, culminating in a climactic scene where only one brother emerges alive. The theme is woven through the fabric of the narrative, its complexities revealed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective. This perspective serves as a window into the protagonist's inner world, a world shaped by his emotions and perceptions, both of which influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest endeavors together to their final, fateful excursion, he feels an underlying resentment towards Doodle. His was a desire for a brother who could share in his passions, to learn from him as he taught, to walk alongside him as he navigated the world. He yearned for a companion in the manner of \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" But life had other plans, and Doodle's frailty dealt a crushing blow to these aspirations. The young protagonist's dreams were dashed, leaving him with a sense of bitterness and despair.\n\nThis anger, however, was tempered by a glimmer of love, sparked by Doodle's innocent smile. This fleeting moment of tenderness revealed a depth to the protagonist's character, one that was previously shrouded in darkness. His trepidation, his consideration of infanticide, was but a facade, a testament to the complexity of human emotion. His love for Doodle, though masked by a façade of resentment, was a constant presence, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a spark of compassion.\n\nThis bond between brothers is a double-edged sword, its power both redemptive and destructive. It is a reminder that our actions have consequences, that our emotions are the guiding force behind our decisions. In the end, it is this bond that shapes us, that reveals our true character, and that demands that we confront the darkness within ourselves.",
            "The mind is a deep well of enigma, a labyrinth of shadowed corridors and dark recesses where the whispers of experience reside. As the ages passed and the world around us underwent its incremental metamorphosis, the analogies used to describe its workings also evolved, a slow and halting dance of comprehension. It was likened to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and most recently, a machine of hissing wires and glowing screens. Yet, these metaphors, like the shifting sands of the dunes, are but fleeting approximations, liable to lead us astray with their silken threads of deception.\n\nInformation, a slow and treacherous river, flows into the mind from the senses, its currents a jumble of tactile whispers, the susurrations of heat, the thrum of sound waves, and the caress of light. These raw stimuli are then transformed, alchemized by the mind's internal fires, in the crucible of bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine a traveler, traversing a forest, where the sounds of the underbrush – the rustling of leaves, the snapping of twigs – coalesce into the unmistakable presence of a wild creature, its shape and form emerging from the cacophony like a ghost from the shadows. Top-down processing, the attentive gaze of a presiding spirit, quickens our recognition, whispers the name of the creature, and assigns it its place in the grand tapestry of our experience.\n\nYet, not all information is created equal. The mind, a capricious monarch, filters out the extraneous, the trivial, the ephemeral, and reserves its attention for the essential, the vital, the meaningful. Like a sentinel, it stands guard over the gates of perception, admitting only what is deemed worthy, and rejecting the rest to the vast and uncaring expanse of the unknown. We are not aware of each blade of grass beneath our feet, nor the countless whispers of the wind, yet our minds remain vigilant, poised to respond to the subtlest hint of danger, the whispered name of a loved one in a crowded room.\n\nInformation must first be stored, and this is a task of intricate and mysterious provenance. There are multiple repositories of memory, each a dark and labyrinthine cave, hiding its secrets from the light. Sensory memory holds the fleeting impressions of the moment, the mirror-smooth surface of the water, the rough bark of the tree. Working memory, a fleeting whisper, holds the information for but a brief instant, a spark of insight that vanishes as quickly as it appears. Long-term memory, a slow and patient river, holds the accumulated wisdom of the ages, the secrets of the past, the mysteries of the yet-to-come.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the mind is a problem of ancient and abiding interest, a riddle that has puzzled scholars and sages for centuries. Some propose that it is a network of interconnected nodes, a vast and intricate web of concepts, each linked to its fellows by threads of association and relation. In this semantic tapestry, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on, an endless and labyrinthine path of meaning and connection.",
            "A specter of modernity looms large in the horizon, a dystopian vision born from the ashes of an all-consuming technological fervor and the cold, calculating tenets of capitalism. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a world where the communal over the individual has become the norm, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the paramount virtue, and the conditioning of the masses is carried out with precision by the omniscient World Controller. Beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, however, lies a web of ideological control, a subtle yet insidious dance of homogeny and reification that reduces the citizenry to mere pawns in a game of conformity.\n\nAs we delve into the world of Huxley's protagonist, we find the telltale signs of a capitalist machine at work, its gears turning, its cogs clicking into place with a calculated efficiency. The thesis of false consciousness comes to mind, a notion born from Marxist theory, where the common folk are kept in the dark about their true relations to the classes above and below, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by the World Controller's subtle hand, has created a society where the lower classes, relegated to their respective stations, are blissfully unaware of the manipulation that governs their existence. The upper echelons, meanwhile, are either complicit in this charade or resigned to their fate, their awareness of the system's machinations merely a distant echo of a long-forgotten truth.\n\nIn this sterile world, relationships are reduced to shallow interactions, a façade of connection that belies the true nature of human experience. Love, once a flame that burns bright, has been extinguished, replaced by the hollow tones of superficial affection. The characters, even those at the forefront of the narrative, are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, their thoughts and emotions stripped bare, leaving only the husk of a humanity that has been drained of its vitality. The interactions between them, a series of stilted exchanges, serve only to reinforce the notion that the rise of technology and capitalism has led to the erosion of free will and the stifling of human expression.\n\nAs we navigate the sterile landscape of Brave New World, we are left to ponder the consequences of a system that values complacency above all else. The societal classes, each resigned to their place in the hierarchy, are a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, their obedience a stark reminder of the proletariat's false consciousness. And so, we are left to wonder: in this world of calculated happiness and controlled dissent, is there room for anything more? Is there a glimmer of hope, a spark that might ignite the flame of resistance against the all-consuming machine of capitalism?\n\nIn the end, it is a question that echoes through the pages of Brave New World, a reminder that even in the most seemingly utopian of societies, the seeds of dissent and rebellion are sown, waiting to be nurtured by those who dare to challenge the status quo.",
            "Four and a half semesters at University Park. The trees lean in over the walkways, casting long shadows in the morning light. I've seen students trudge through the winter's grasp, their breath misting in the chill air. The East Halls dorms, where I first laid my head, stood sentinel at the farthest edge of campus, a bastion of isolation. To reach the Willard building, a hub of academic activity, the walk could take twenty-five minutes, the minutes ticking away like grains of sand in an hourglass. The weather, a constant companion, could slow the pace to a crawl.\n\nI spoke with a fellow student, an alumnus not much older than myself, and he spoke of the days when the East Halls dorms stood apart, surrounded by a vast expanse of vacant land. Now, that emptiness has given way to a sprawl of sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus expands, the distances between destinations lengthen, and the pathways narrow. In this labyrinth, the bicycle stands as a beacon of efficiency and freedom.\n\nBut the bike itself is mere potential, a tool waiting to be wielded. It is the student who must take the reins, who must ride the bike with purpose and intent. And the campus, too, must be designed with the bicyclist in mind, a network of roads and pathways that weave together like the threads of a tapestry.\n\nI recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joy of cycling after a hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his words laced with conviction. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The benefits of cycling extend beyond the physical, a symbiotic relationship between body and machine. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a morning ride can propel you twenty-five miles or more, a testament to the bicycle's efficiency.\n\nAs an off-campus resident, I've found myself relying on my bike to navigate the terrain. The Thomas building, a hub of academic activity, is a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep. But with the bike, that journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a testament to the power of human ingenuity. However, the road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not always an easy one, a serpentine path through the urban landscape.\n\nThere are those who prefer the gentle stroll, the rhythmic cadence of footsteps on pavement. But for me, time is a luxury I can ill afford. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, a journey that would consume an extra thirty to forty minutes of my day, a time sink that would leave me drained. The cumulative effect would be staggering, a loss of two and a half hours each week, a sacrifice I'm not willing to make.\n\nIn this crucible of time and space, the bicycle stands as a symbol of liberation, a tool that can bridge the gaps between destinations, a bridge that can be built or broken, depending on the choices we make. As the campus continues to evolve, let us not forget the humble bicycle, a simple machine that can change the world, one pedal stroke at a time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, a beacon of hope for the forsaken and the oppressed. My intention is to walk the treacherous terrain of social work, to navigate the labyrinthine paths of the abused and the neglected, and to provide solace to the troubled families that have been ravaged by the tempests of life. The values that animate my pursuit are service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the betterment of relationships and the self.\n\nIn the wasteland of uncertainty, I have often found myself lost, unsure of the path that lay ahead. Yet, it was the specter of human suffering that beckoned me, a siren's call to a life of purpose. As I traversed the barren expanse of high school and college, I witnessed the syphoning of hope from the lives of those around me. Many fled from their problems, abandoning all semblance of stability, while others clung to coping mechanisms that were little more than a veneer of despair. It was in this desolate landscape that I found my calling, a Bachelor's degree in Psychology a paltry shield against the incoming tide of human suffering.\n\nThe summer of 2009, a season of reflection, found me at a crossroads. It was then that I encountered a young boy, sixteen years old and adrift in a sea of turmoil. His story was a litany of pain, a testament to the ravages of abuse and neglect. It was in that moment that I knew my path was set, that I would walk the treacherous roads of social work, armed with nothing but a degree in Psychology and a burning desire to make a difference.\n\nThe parents, two figures shrouded in a veil of deceit, seemed to mock the very idea of help. Their words, a jarring cacophony of excuses and justifications, fell upon me like a cold wind. And yet, I knew that I had to act, to intervene in the dance of denial that had become their lives. I spoke to the police, a hesitant voice in the darkness, and offered what little knowledge I possessed. The outcome was uncertain, but I knew that I had taken the first step on a long and arduous journey.\n\nSocial justice, a concept that has haunted me since my formative years, is the fire that burns within me. A society that claims to value individuality yet seeks to suffocate it beneath a sea of conformity is a paradox that I find unbearable. I have walked this tightrope, a tightrope of self-expression and nonconformity, ever since I was a child. I have worn my hair in unnatural hues, worn clothing that defied the norms, pierced my ears in a gesture of defiance, and spoken out against the injustices that I have witnessed. And I will continue to do so, for it is in the pursuit of social justice that I find my purpose.\n\nIn the end, it is not the destination that matters, but the journey itself. It is the darkness that we face, the uncertainty that we must navigate, that shapes us into the individuals we are meant to be. And it is in the face of this uncertainty that I find solace, a solace that will guide me on my path as a social worker, a path that is fraught with peril, but one that I am willing to walk.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human condition, sleep disorders cast long shadows over the lives of countless individuals. Insomnia, a specter that haunts the minds of many, is a disorder that has been shrouded in mystery. The Biological and Sociocultural models attempt to unravel the threads that bind this enigma, each offering a unique perspective on the complexities of this affliction. This paper will delve into the recesses of these models, illuminating the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of insomnia.\n\nThe Biological model, a labyrinth of intricacies, navigates the treacherous waters of genetics and physiology. Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny sentinels of the brain, contain orexin, a molecule that regulates the delicate dance of sleep and wakefulness. Research has shown that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons hold the key to understanding the sleep-wake states of an individual. The activation of these receptors, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces a somnambulant response, while their inhibition, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, reduces anxiety and induces slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been found to increase sleep time in animal models, a discovery that hints at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. A problem or absence with this receptor, a crack in the edifice of sleep, can alter the ability to slumber without medication, leaving the individual adrift in a sea of wakefulness.\n\nThe Sociocultural model, a tapestry woven from the threads of environmental relationships, offers a broader perspective on insomnia. It examines the intersections of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, each a unique strand in the intricate web of factors that contribute to this disorder. The inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor, a genetic predisposition, can regulate sleep, and an alteration of this receptor can naturally disturb sleep, impacting aspects of life that require focus and attention. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nThe research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the complexities of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of primary sleep disorders, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Each of these disorders, a unique facet of the sleep-wake spectrum, offers a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of insomnia. The Parasomnias, a category of sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, add another layer to the tapestry of insomnia, a reminder that this disorder is not solely a product of biology, but also of the complex interplay between environment and genetics.\n\nThe research of Matsuki et al. (2009) offers a nuanced understanding of the GABAB receptor and its role in sleep regulation. The study's findings, a testament to the power of science, suggest that the activation of this receptor induces sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces somnolence. The implications of this research are far-reaching, hinting at the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. This understanding can shed light on the etiology of insomnia, a disorder that has long been shrouded in mystery.\n\nHowever, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations. The study's focus on animal models, a narrow lens through which to view the complexities of human sleep, raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. The sociocultural implications of the study, a reminder that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor can regulate sleep, are also worthy of consideration. The weight of this realization settles heavy on the individual, a burden that threatens to consume their very existence.\n\nIn conclusion, the Biological and Sociocultural models offer a nuanced understanding of insomnia, a disorder that is both multifaceted and complex. The research that has been conducted in this area is a testament to the intricacies of this affliction, and the findings of Matsuki et al. (2009) offer a glimpse into the genetic and environmental basis of the human GABAB receptor. However, like the darkness that shrouds the land, the research also has its limitations, and a more comprehensive understanding of insomnia will require a broader examination of the interplay between biology and environment.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a disorder so insidious, so pervasive, that it threatens to upend the very fabric of our understanding. This is Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a malady that besets the central nervous system, rendering it incapable of processing the auditory world with the clarity and precision it demands. Like a desert wind that withers the trees, CAPD robs its victims of the ability to discern the subtleties of sound, leaving them lost and adrift in a sea of cacophony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first stumbled upon the concept of \"auditory imperception.\" Like a faint echo, it was a notion that lingered in the shadows, waiting to be fleshed out by the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954. Their pioneering work laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the disorder, and it was not until 1961 that Kimura introduced the concept of dichotic testing, a method that would allow researchers to peer into the very workings of the brain's auditory processing machinery.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in a multitude of ways, each one a bitter reminder of the disorder's insidious power. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, as if the very notion of spatial awareness has been lost on them. They may falter in distinguishing between two or more acoustic events, their minds unable to discern the subtleties of sound. The patterns of speech, once a reliable guidepost, now become a jumbled mess of confusion. And the sequence of sounds, once a logical progression, becomes a maddening puzzle.\n\nDiagnosis is a perilous journey, fraught with uncertainty and doubt. The process involves a systematic observation of listening behavior, a painstaking examination of the patient's auditory function, and a series of tests designed to push the limits of their processing abilities. Like a desert wanderer searching for an oasis, the clinician must navigate a labyrinthine maze of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations, all in the hope of uncovering the hidden truth. There is no single, foolproof test, no silver bullet that can guarantee a diagnosis. The disorder remains a mystery, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons and deceives.\n\nYet, even in the face of uncertainty, there is hope. A teacher, armed with knowledge and compassion, can be a beacon of light in the darkness. By understanding the subtleties of CAPD, they can create an environment that is supportive and inclusive, a haven where the afflicted can learn to navigate the complexities of the auditory world. It is a challenge, yes, but one that can be met with patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the disorder's insidious power.\n\nIn the end, it is not the disorder that defines us, but our response to it. Like the desert itself, CAPD is a harsh and unforgiving environment, but it is one that can be navigated, one that can be overcome. And it is in this knowledge that we find hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness that guides us forward, ever forward, into the unknown.",
            "The artificial masquerade of Twelfth Night poses a dire question: can one ever truly shed the skin of deception, or are we forever bound to the guises we've assumed? The play's exploration of disguise reveals a bitter truth: the art of deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting us free from the shackles of our true selves, yet ensnaring us in a labyrinth of alienation and disconnection.\n\nIn the fleeting world of the theater, Viola's ruse as Cesario serves as a fragile bulwark against the cruelties of a foreign land. Yet, this calculated stratagem exacts a terrible toll, severing her ties to the women who might have offered her solace and support. Her impersonation becomes so convincing that it beguiles even the lovesick Olivia, who sees in Cesario a reflection of her own desires, rather than the truth of Viola's own heart.\n\nAs the play unfolds, the masks of identity begin to slip, revealing the tangled web of suppressed emotions that lies beneath. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario may be a jest, a satire of the societal norms that reduce people to shallow facades. Her sudden switch to Sebastian, however, hints at a more profound truth: that true love knows no bounds, nor is bound by the strictures of societal expectation. \n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: can we ever truly shed the disguises we've worn, or are we forever trapped in a hall of mirrors, reflecting back at us the distortions of our own making? The characters of Olivia and Orsino, caught in the whirlpool of their own desires, seem to suggest that sometimes the only way to break free is to confront the shadows that lie within.\n\nIn this harsh world of masquerade and deception, we are forced to confront the darkness within ourselves, and the price we pay for the disguises we wear. The play's exploration of this theme serves as a reminder that our true selves are forever hidden, like a vein of coal in the earth, waiting to be unearthed by the rocky tides of experience.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the colonial landscape, a tale of contrasts unfolds. The German colonial empire, a behemoth of brutality and exploitation, left an indelible mark on the nations it claimed. The genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa stands as a gruesome testament to the empire's unyielding ferocity. Yet, this is but a single thread in the complex tapestry of German colonial rule, a story woven from diverse policies, governing styles, and geography.\n\nThe educational provision across the colonies mirrors the empire's multifaceted nature. In East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of educated and literate Africans, a legacy of German efforts that earned praise from contemporary observers. In contrast, South West Africa presented a stark picture of neglect, where the task of native education fell to missionary societies, coddled by the government's limited support. Simultaneously, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, haunting South West Africa long after the empire's collapse.\n\nThe divergent experiences of the German colonies can be attributed to a constellation of social, political, and economic factors. This paper seeks to illuminate these influences, casting a spotlight on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. A rich literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, mostly penned in German and composed during or shortly after the period of colonial rule. These early works aimed to catalog the features of educational systems, while later English-language studies delved deeper, conducting comparative analyses and probing specific aspects of education. The seminal work of Cohen stands as a benchmark, dissecting the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, and pinpointing the large settler population as a key factor driving the differences between them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of arid desert and temperate oases, boasted a European population of nearly 15,000 by 1913, dwarfing the settler population of East Africa. This demographic disparity had profound implications for the colony's educational landscape, as evidenced by Cohen's study. In the shadows of the colonial edifice, the voices of the native Africans remain silenced, their experiences and perspectives lost to the annals of history. This narrative, though, offers a glimpse into the labyrinthine corridors of the colonial psyche, illuminating the dark recesses of a bygone era, where the shadows of oppression continue to linger.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the landscape of popular music has undergone a metamorphosis, a morass of genres that defy classification. Like a barren wasteland, the terrain is pockmarked with the remnants of bygone eras, each one a testament to the transience of sound. The behemoth that is Heavy Metal, a leviathan of a genre, has sprawled across the musical tapestry, its tendrils reaching into the very depths of the human experience.\n\nWithin this behemoth, a labyrinth of sub and sub-sub genres has spawned, each one a reflection of the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A darkness that is at once a manifestation of the human condition, and a reflection of the primal fears that lurk within us all. It is a darkness that is expressed through the cathartic release of sound, a symphony of rage and despair that echoes through the void.\n\nAnd yet, despite the diversity that has come to define Heavy Metal, there is a unifying thread that runs through it all - the thread of darkness. A darkness that is not just a reflection of the music itself, but a reflection of the world in which we live. A world that is beset on all sides by the ravages of time, a world that is slowly succumbing to the entropy that is inherent in all things.\n\nIt is a world that is reflected in the lyrics of the damned, the ravings of the tormented, and the screams of the desperate. A world that is captured in the swirling vortex of sound that is Heavy Metal, a world that is both beautiful and ugly, a world that is both a reflection of ourselves, and a reflection of our place in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of musical innovation, were among the first to tap into this wellspring of darkness, their song Helter Skelter a paean to the chaos that lies at the heart of human experience. A song that is both a reflection of the turmoil that ravages our souls, and a reflection of the resilience that allows us to carry on in the face of adversity.\n\nLike the first tentative steps into the unknown, the creation of Heavy Metal was a journey into the very heart of darkness. A journey that has taken us to the very limits of human endurance, and beyond. A journey that has left us scarred, bruised, and forever changed. And yet, it is a journey that we continue to embark upon, a journey that is both a testament to our resilience, and a reflection of our own mortality.",
            "In a world that slumbered beyond the veils of sanity, a man with a brush born of dreams conjured forth visions on canvas. Henri Rousseau, a name etched in the annals of time, toiled in obscurity, his heart afire with the passion of creation. The Dream, a 1910 tapestry woven from the very fabric of his being, revealed not only a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, but also the artist's own tortured struggle to find acceptance in a world that shunned the unconventional.\n\nAs the moon cast its silvery glow upon the rolling hills of northwest France, where Rousseau's own life's canvas was set to unfurl, the seeds of his destiny were sown. Born on a fateful day in May, 1844, the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, Rousseau's early life was a tapestry of ordinary toil and quiet desperation. The call of art, however, beckoned, and he heeded the siren's song, though his formal training was but a distant memory, lost in the mists of time. The title of douanier, a customs inspector, clung to him like a shroud, a badge of a life unlived.\n\nThe passing of his first wife, Clémence, and the silent departure of eight infant children left Rousseau with but a single daughter, Julia, and a void that could not be filled. In the face of such desolation, he turned to the brush, a refuge from the abyss that yawned before him. Unlike his contemporaries, who saw the peasant as a symbol of rustic charm, Rousseau saw himself in their midst, a folk painter, driven by the hopes and fears of the common man.\n\nThe weight of his unfulfilled dreams pressed upon him like a physical force, a constant reminder that he was but a novice in a world of masters. The likes of Matisse, with his revolutionary style, eclipsed Rousseau, a painter of convention, whose very ambition was to be accepted by the art world. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, the two men were poles apart, their reasons for painting as disparate as the stars in a midnight sky: Matisse, driven by a terror of the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint with such banality that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn The Dream, Rousseau bared his soul, a canvas of longing, of the struggle to balance the desire for recognition with the need to remain true to oneself. A world of dreams and reality blurred, as the artist's inner demons wrestled with the external world, a battleground where the lines between truth and art were forever blurred. And so, in the Dream, we see not only a woman lost in a mystical realm, but the very essence of Rousseau's being, a man torn asunder by the conflicting desires of his heart and mind.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread weaves its way through the tapestry of ethics and aesthetics, a subtle yet unbreakable bond between truth and beauty. It is a notion that has been pondered by the greatest minds, a notion that transcends the confines of education and experience. As the poet John Keats so eloquently puts it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is as if the essence of morality and art is an unspoken language, one that resonates within us, yet defies the constraints of words.\n\nWe grapple with the complexities of what is good and beautiful, but our attempts to pin down these concepts fall short. They elude us like a will-o'-the-wisp, always just out of reach. Our analyses of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa may revolve around concepts like foreground and background, but ultimately, these are mere descriptions, not the source of its beauty. When asked to explain the power of a favorite work of art or literature, we often find ourselves resorting to vague phrases like \"There's just something about it.\" This is because, as the writer Flannery O'Connor so astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nSimilarly, ethics defies reduction to a set of rules or principles. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it is this very transcendent quality, this unnamable \"je ne sais quoi,\" that binds ethics and aesthetics together. This intangible connection is what makes art and morality so powerful, so resonant.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is beyond the reaches of language, a level that is noumenal, to use the Kantian term. This is where the impact of art and morality is felt most profoundly, in the depths of our being. And nowhere is this connection more evident than in literature, where the moral quality is an integral part of its very essence. As is said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the depths of a land forsaken, where the Alps stood sentinel and the Baltic sea lapped against the shores, a nation arose, forged from the crucible of a thousand cultures. The Germany of today stands as a testament to this incongruity, a land of contrasts, where the shadows of the past linger, and the ghosts of empires past whisper through the valleys. From the storied city of München, where the Alps cradle the heart of the nation, to the wind-swept shores of the Baltic, where the grey sea meets the grey skies, the German spirit is a tapestry woven from threads of disparate cultures, a testament to the resilience of a people forged in the fire of adversity.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" is a whispered secret, shrouded in the mists of time, its origins disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a voice from the past, claimed that the name arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, their name a reminder of the tumultuous battles they fought against the Gaulish forces. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, a conqueror of lands and a chronicler of the human spirit, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, a testament to the clash of civilizations that shaped the fate of a continent. He took the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered and the unconquered, the defeated and the defiant.\n\nAs the years passed, the question of the name's origin persisted, a mystery that refused to yield to the passage of time. Some posited that it referred to the spear, the \"ger\" that the Germanic warriors wielded in battle, a symbol of their unyielding resolve. Others suggested that it came from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that captured the essence of the Germanic people, their voices raised in defiance, their spirits unbroken. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the cold light of the first century, penned a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Germans, a people who dwelled in a land of wild beauty, where the skies were unforgiving and the people were unyielding. In his De Origine et situ Germanorum, he wrote of the Germans as a people apart, unbroken by the tides of history, their culture a testament to their enduring presence. Who would leave the warmth of Asia or Africa, the grandeur of Rome, for the wilds of Germania, unless it were their home, their heart's desire? (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so the Germanic tribes dwelled on the fringes of the Roman Empire, their presence a reminder of the empire's reach, their influence a testament to the power of a people unbroken by the forces of conquest. They traded their wares, their skills, and their blood for the privilege of serving within the ranks of the Roman army, their presence a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward, always a path to be forged.

            "I gazed down, a vacant expression etched on my face, my mind sifting through the scene before me like ashes in a gust of wind. The world was a vast, unbroken canvas, its colors muted and its texture rough, like the pockmarked skin of a long-forgotten land. My thoughts were a ceaseless flow, a river of comprehension that ebbed and flowed, never quite coalescing into anything tangible. It was as if I'd shed the burden of thought, leaving myself to drift on a tide of observation.\n\nYears ago, in a dimly lit room, I'd stumbled upon a book on drawing. It was a meager thing, a handful of lines and shapes, but it spoke to something deep within me. The author spoke of squares, of frames, of the way the mind can be tricked into seeing the world anew. I'd wanted to draw since I was a child, to capture the world in all its messy beauty. But it was more than that – it was a way to hold the world still, to pin it down like a butterfly on a pin. The artist's frame was a device, a tool to corral the chaos, to tame the unmanageable.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in time, I couldn't conjure the artist's square. The world was too vast, too overwhelming. I was lost in the depths of it, a small, insignificant speck, adrift in a sea of wonder. The masters – Picasso, Monet, the Italians – they'd all had their moments, their epiphanies. If I were to be an artist, if I were to leave my mark on the world, it had to start here, with this, the beginning of my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for the toilet handle, my thoughts a jumble of anxiety and frustration. Water swirled, a vortex of crystal clear water, and I was powerless to stop it. My hand jerked, spasmed, and struck the handle again, but the package remained, stubborn and unyielding, a mocking presence in the midst of my creative crucible.\n\nI stood there, a man lost in a world of his own making, a world of brown and beige and dull, unyielding matter. My grip on the mop tightened, my feet planted firmly on the ground, as I gazed upon the offending bundle. A few more minutes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved, slow and deliberate, towards the wall, towards the toilet paper, towards the ultimate act of creation. I was a sculptor, a master of the mundane, and this was my masterpiece.\n\nAs I dipped my hand into the bowl, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of purpose. This was art, this was creation, and I was its master. And for a moment, in that moment, I was free.",
            "In the twilight of lives, when the morrow's dawn still clings to the horizon like a shroud, a specter stalks the roads, a harbinger of death. Teenagers, blinded by the siren song of freedom, their eyes locked on the horizon, their hearts afire with a reckless abandon, behind the wheel, their very inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the unsuspecting world. The statistics are stark, a grim testament to the carnage they sow: the National Institutes of Health reveal a truth that should shake the very foundations of our collective conscience – the teenage brain, still unfolding like a lotus flower, is not yet ready to navigate the treacherous waters of driving.\n\nInexperience, a woeful lack of wisdom, and a propensity for the thrill of the unknown, a maelstrom of factors that conspire against the young and the innocent. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has sounded the alarm, its findings a clarion call to action: the age of the passenger is directly correlated to the number of accidents on the road. The correlation is a noose, tightening around the neck of our youth, a noose that can be loosened only by a concerted effort to address the root cause of this scourge.\n\nThe provisional driver's licenses, a Band-Aid solution, a temporary fix for a problem that runs far deeper. We are fooling ourselves, deluding ourselves into thinking that by restricting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers, we are somehow mitigating the risks. But we are not. The issue is not the license, it is the individual, the young driver, still a leaf blown about by the winds of whim and folly.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage of the human psyche, has warned us of the dangers of issuing driver's licenses to those under the age of 19-20. His research speaks of a primal urge, a desire to take risks for the sheer exhilaration of it all. We are tempting fate, tempting the gods, by allowing these young drivers to take the wheel. We are courting disaster, inviting the specter of death to join us on the roads.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not revolutionary, merely a return to sanity, a recognition of the fact that our young drivers are not yet ready for the responsibilities that come with the keys to a car. Schools can continue to provide the educational foundation, but until the age of 18, the roads must remain closed to them. A provisional permit can still be issued, but only after a rigorous training program, one that includes a minimum of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. This is not a novel idea, merely a common-sense solution to a problem that has been festering for far too long.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better. The lives of our young people depend on it. The ghosts of the road, the specter of death, will not be silenced until we take action. We must act, we must legislate, and we must protect our youth from the dangers that lurk on the roads, dangers that are as much a product of their own inexperience as they are of our own negligence.",
            "Deep within the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's labyrinthine repository of early Edison films, I chanced upon a cache of trick films, fifteen in total, from the halcyon days of 1895 to the nascent years of 1901. These cinematic conjurings, forged in the crucible of creative editing, danced on the precipice of illusion, their poetics waiting to be unraveled like a skein of unraveling thread. My foray into the world of trick films centered on dissecting the underlying principles that governed the majority of these enigmatic motion pictures, while also tracing the evolutionary divergences that distinguished a select few of the later entries.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the heart of the trick film, I discovered a prevailing aesthetic that bound these early cinematic endeavors together. Like a prisoner confined to a narrow cell, the trick film was set-bound, its compositional parameters defined by the strictures of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained rooted in its appointed position, unmoving and unyielding, as if bound to the very spot where the story unfolded. The resulting films, bereft of camera movement, relied on the steadfastness of the proscenium to conjure the illusion of drama and narrative. The adherence to long and medium shots, a direct descendant of the stage and vaudeville traditions, further underscored the static nature of the trick film.\n\nYet, as the years ticked by, a nascent sense of experimentation began to seep into the fabric of trick films. A few bold spirits, unencumbered by the strictures of convention, dared to challenge the status quo by introducing innovations such as multiple shots. Like a glimmer of light piercing the darkness, these new techniques hinted at a world beyond the narrow confines of the proscenium.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the trick films, a thread that wove its way through the entirety of the Edison catalog, was their penchant for filming within the confines of an interior set. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, remained fixed in its proscenium position, a static sentinel guarding the unfolding drama. This composition, born of the theatre and vaudeville traditions, imposed a strict limitation on the movement of figures within the frame. Like puppets on a string, the actors were confined to a narrow axis, their movements restricted to the horizontal plane. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) served as a prime example of this phenomenon, its actors entering from the right side and moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, their exit from the frame occurring without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated the shot length of these early trick films. Like a metronome marking time, the shots tended to be long and, on occasion, medium shots. Close-ups, a staple of modern cinema, were an anomaly in the trick films, their absence a testament to the stage and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, confined to the middle ground, remained steadfast, their faces and actions frozen in time, unmoving and unyielding, like statues in a garden of stone.\n\nThe trick films, bound by the strictures of their one-shot-per-film methodology, were limited in length, their narrative and dramatic potential curtailed by the constraints of their compositional format. Most trick films, akin to vaudeville acts, focused on short, attention-grabbing tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, bereft of narrative depth or dramatic complexity. Yet, even within these limitations, a few trick films, like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), revealed a more nuanced understanding of the medium, their physical shots joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance, a testament to the evolving art of the trick film.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of his mind, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a steadfast sentinel, his convictions a bulwark against the tempests of a world gone mad. A farmer by trade, a politician by chance, he had dedicated his life to the unfettered pursuit of personal freedom and the sanctity of government. The agrarian ideals that had guided his plow had become the lodestar of his life, illuminating the dark recesses of his soul and illuminating the path to a system of government that would preserve the sacred rights of man.\n\nIn a land unshackled by the fetters of tradition, Taylor saw an opportunity to forge a new nation, one where the virtuous and the vicious alike would be tempered by the fire of self-governance. He believed that the natural rights of man, like the seasons, were interdependent – that the denial of one would sow the seeds of discord and wither the harvest of the rest. These rights, like the unyielding roots of a tree, must be shielded from the grasping hands of government.\n\nTaylor's vision was one of a dualistic world, where the inherent goodness and evil of humanity were locked in an eternal struggle. He saw government as a reflection of this duality, its virtues and vices born of the same flawed humanity that governed it. A government, he believed, must be founded on the principles of private property, agricultural prosperity, and the curtailment of avarice. Only thus could it ensure that the self-interest that drove humanity would not be the sole arbiter of its actions, but rather a force tempered by the public good.\n\nLike a stubborn oak, Taylor stood firm in his conviction that the Constitution must be interpreted with a strict hand, its words a sacred text that must be read with the intent of its authors in mind. He knew that a government with too much power was like a raging fire, devouring all in its path, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was a recipe for disaster. The Declaration of Independence, with its ringing words of sovereignty and liberty, was to him the true charter of the United States, a beacon that guided him through the treacherous waters of his time.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project - a decline as precipitous as the grey slope of a winter's hill. It was a disheartening turn, a shadow that crept over the landscape of our initiative like a chill wind. The reasons for this downturn were as elusive as the mist that rose from the frozen earth. Perhaps the winter's grip on the campus had begun to tighten, trapping some beneath its icy grip, forcing them to abandon their bicycles and their feet, to succumb to the convenience of wheels and the warmth of their cars. Or maybe the weight of semester's end, the crushing pressure to finish, to grade, to flee, had obscured the log from their minds, a small but vital task lost in the whirlwind of the season. And of course, the holidays, those times of feasting and forgetting, had brought a halt to the project's momentum, as if the very mention of it had been stricken from the collective memory. But December's passing, and January's chill, and still the logs remained sparse, a puzzle that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nIn the face of this enigma, we sought to rekindle the flame, to reanimate the initiative. We conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting but fiery spark that flared to life in March, casting a brief but warm glow over our efforts. And lo, the logs began to flow once more, like the gentle thawing of a winter's night. But the question remained: how to sustain this momentum, to keep the project from succumbing to the same forces that had brought it low. For in this world, where freedom and independence and flexibility were the watchwords, where the siren's call of the car was ever-present, it seemed a Sisyphean task to persuade people to abandon their wheels for the uncertain pleasures of alternative transportation.\n\nWe offered incentives, tokens of our appreciation, in the form of gift certificates to the local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores. But were they enough? Would the promise of a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle have been enough to stir the hearts of our commuters, to rouse them from their torpor? We may never know, for the prizes remained constant throughout the project's duration. But it is a tantalizing prospect, a what-if that haunts us still. What if we had announced, in December, the addition of a bicycle, and in January, a hybrid car? Would the logs have flowed more freely, the project's momentum uninterrupted by the hurdles of the holiday season and the semester's end? We can only speculate, lost in the mists of what might have been.",
            "In the desolate expanse of financial markets, a peculiar creature lurked, its essence distilled in the form of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. This creature, born from the confluence of indices, commodities, and baskets of assets, seemed to embody the very essence of flexibility, trading with the ephemeral ease of a stock on an exchange. It offered the diversification of an index fund and the singular allure of single stock ownership, a siren's call to investors seeking the best of both worlds.\n\nYet, as with all creatures, there existed a price to be paid. The expense ratios of these ETFs, though lower than those of their mutual fund brethren, were a reminder that even the most alluring of creatures can be a double-edged sword. The need to pay a commission on each transaction, a fee that hung over the investor like a specter, served as a constant reminder of the ETF's existence.\n\nLike a wilderness, the ETF IHF sprawled before us, its top 10 holdings a testament to its power and complexity. To navigate this labyrinth, we narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which comprised 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These 10, a subset of the whole, seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's inner workings.\n\nBut to truly comprehend the ETF, we must delve deeper, into the realm of Beta and return. Like the twisting paths of a forestry, the Beta and return calculations wove a complex tapestry, one that revealed a startling truth: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return, a 16% increase, with a Beta that was 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. The siren's call of the ETF, it seemed, was not without its drawbacks.\n\nYet, like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies. The possibility of statistical significance hung over the results like a specter, a reminder that even the most compelling of arguments can be fleeting. To pierce the veil of uncertainty, we turned to the standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's volatility.\n\nThe standard deviation, a measure of the ETF's inner turmoil, hung like a shadow over the results. Normalized to 100%, the accumulated standard deviation of the top 10 stocks seemed to whisper secrets of the ETF's fundamental nature. Like the rustling of leaves in an autumnal wind, the results seemed to suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might be the key to unlocking the ETF's true potential.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of financial markets, the ETF IHF remained an enigma, a creature of mystery and intrigue. Its top 10 holdings, a subset of the whole, seemed to hold the key to understanding the ETF's inner workings. But like the shifting sands of a desert, the results were not without their inconsistencies, leaving the question: can a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings truly provide a higher return with a lower Beta? Only time, like the passing of the seasons, would tell.",
            "As if conjured from the darkest recesses of the mind, Dream-Land stood as one of Edgar Allan Poe's most celebrated creations. Yet, it was in the forgotten shards of this work that a hidden thread of influence lay concealed, woven from the very fabric of a bygone era. In lines 6 and 56, Poe wove the enigmatic tapestry of \"Thulé\", a term whose origins unfold like a fable, reaching back to the ancient Virgil. But, like a ghostly presence, it was not the Roman poet alone who bore responsibility for this enigmatic term. Poe's fascination with the German masters, particularly Goethe, lay at the heart of this mystique.\n\nA whispered legacy of influence, Poe's debt to Goethe's works was one that would be echoed by scholars for years to come. Karl J. Arndt, in his erudite tome, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, would unravel the tangled threads of their poetic kinship, leaving no doubt as to the deliberate echoes of the German master. It was as if Poe had set out to craft a dark and twisted doppelganger, a shadowy reflection of Goethe's own creations.\n\nIt was in the somber realm of Faust, that grand and tragic drama penned by Goethe, that the poet would find the seeds of his own \"Thule\". The King of Thule, a poem woven into the fabric of Faust's second part, spoke of a monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his queen, drinking away the bitter memories of their love. As the king's world crumbled, he surrendered to the void, his legacy reduced to the solitary goblet, a potent symbol of his devastation. And so, like a ghostly specter, the King of Thulé haunted the pages of Poe's Dream-Land, a poignant testament to the poet's own struggles with loss and the allure of the abyss.\n\nIn the collected works of Poe, the term \"Thulé\" would reappear, like a recurring nightmare, a haunting refrain that whispered secrets of a world beyond the veil. As in The Pit and the Pendulum, Poe would invoke the echoes of Goethe's creation, weaving a dark and foreboding tapestry of shadows and despair. And in the depths of this abyss, the two poets would meet, their visions entwined like the branches of two twisted trees, their darkness amplified by the silence of the night.\n\nAs Poe navigated the labyrinthine paths of his own creative subconscious, he would find himself drawn to the somber landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where shadows reigned supreme, and the colors of life had long since faded away. In this desolate realm, the speaker of Dream-Land wandered, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, his world shrouded in a perpetual twilight, devoid of hope or solace. It was as if Poe had taken up the mantle of the King of Thulé, his own demons driving him forward, through the treacherous landscape of his own broken heart.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of literary history, Poe and Goethe would meet, their works entwined like the roots of two ancient trees, their darkness and despair a testament to the power of the human imagination. As the ages passed, their legacy would endure, a haunting reminder of the power of art to capture the very essence of our darkest fears and deepest longings. And in the end, it was not the light of knowledge that would guide us, but the shadows of our own lost souls, forever bound to the dark and twisted world of the imagination.",
            "In the court of California, a query arises as to whether a customer, injured by the fall from an applesauce spill in a grocery store, can claim punitive damages from the store's manager, who, after being informed twice of the spill, chose to delay cleaning it for thirty minutes while partaking in a dinner break. A judge, in weighing the merits of this claim, would likely not dismiss it outright. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were motivated by a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from their conduct. Moreover, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were despicable, meaning reprehensible and lacking in moral fiber. Jennifer Palmer, the plaintiff in this case, can argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have been aware of the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple instances of slips and falls that had occurred at the store in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose to ignore the hazard, opting instead to enjoy his dinner.\n\nThe plaintiff's contention that Martin's actions were despicable may not be as convincing, yet it remains a reasonable argument, given the recurring slip-and-fall incidents that had plagued the store in 2009, including six reported incidents prior to Palmer's accident. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the spill to Martin's attention, to which he replied with the same dismissive attitude. It was not until 5:30 pm, when Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury, that the gravity of the situation became apparent. \n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were motivated by oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, actions that are despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately chose to ignore them.

            "In the stillness that follows the passage of time, I find myself wandering back to a course I once took on the subject of Islam at CBC.  The fervor of debate that coursed through those discussions still echoes within me.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion continues to gnaw at my mind, its relevance sharpened by the events that have transpired since that fateful day in 2001.  I recall how the media's gaze shifted, like a desert sun, from a harsh scrutiny of Islam to an almost perverse tolerance, a tolerance that was as unyielding as the desert sands.  And yet, in that same era, a figure emerged, a man named Barack Obama, whose family's ties to Islam seemed to hold no significance in the minds of the masses.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, its contradictions a puzzle that refuses to be solved.  The man I thought I knew, the man of fire and steel, who conquered and claimed dominion over tribes, seems to have been supplanted by a figure of quiet humility.  A man who, according to the biography, was a martyr, misunderstood and humbled by the will of others.  And yet, it was this very same man who drew people to him, one by one, as the truth of his words and deeds became clear.  The similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad are striking, but it is the manner in which they are presented that troubles me.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that echoes the bounty of Jesus' own miracles, seems less a demonstration of power and more a testament to Muhammad's willingness to serve.  This is a narrative that belies the truth, for it reduces the grandeur of Jesus' life and teachings to a mere echo of Muhammad's.\n\nThe stories that make up the biography are a tangled web of hearsay and second-hand accounts, each one a thread that weaves a fragile tapestry of truth.  The authors' intention, to provide proof of the 'witness' of Muhammad's message, only serves to undermine the very fabric of the stories themselves.  The further removed from the source, the more suspect the narrative becomes, a fragile reed that bends in the wind of doubt.\n\nBut it is not the stories that bother me most, it is the way in which they seek to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a godly man, humble and wise.  History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of power and ambition, of a man who rose to greatness through force and guile.  And so, I am left to wonder, what do Muslims today know of the truth behind Muhammad's ascension to power?  Does the myth of the humble prophet blind them to the reality of the man who forged their faith?",
            "In the tumultuous expanse of time, a great divergence unfolded, like the gradual darkening of a winter's sky. The teachings of Jesus, born of the earth and the spirit, were soon lost to the ambitious undertow of Christian thought. As the years ebbed and flowed, a tide of doctrine rose, obscuring the original intention of the faith. It was as if the very voice of the divine had been muffled by the murmur of dogma and tradition.\n\nIn the broad sweep of history, a trend became apparent – one of Christianity drifting ever further from its source. The world, it seemed, was moving in a direction opposite to its own. The stalwart and the unwavering, those who clung to the familiar and the known, would resist the tides of change. Yet, their collective voice, though loud, would prove insufficient to stem the tide.\n\nA new awareness, a yearning for the authentic, would stir in the hearts of many. They would seek to peel away the layers of doctrine, to return to the unadorned truth of Jesus' words. This was a process that would take time, perhaps centuries, but it was inevitable. The clock of history would turn backward, and the religion would be reclaimed from the hands of those who had transformed it into a labyrinth of dogma.\n\nAs the trend swept through the lands of the United States and Europe, a profound transformation would unfold. The people would return to the simplicity of Jesus' teachings, unencumbered by the weight of tradition. The once-diverse and fragmented Christian world would become increasingly uniform, like the smooth expanse of a lake on a windless day.\n\nHuman history was replete with examples of such reversals. The once-persecuted Christians, shunned and slaughtered by the Roman Empire, would one day claim dominion over it. The nation, born of slavery, would rise to leadership. And so, too, would the Christian faith, shedding its accumulated layers of doctrine, return to its source.\n\nA crucial aspect of this reversal would be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphor, rather than literal truth. Only by stripping away the encrustations of time and tradition could the essence of the faith be revealed.\n\nLooking back into the depths of history, we find the theological foundation of Christianity – Judaism. The Hebrew scriptures, the perception of a single, divine authority, and the monotheistic creed – all these were in place long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem. Yet, even within Judaism, there was no singular spirit. The people were fractured, divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "The depths of human nature, like a stagnant pool, reveal the stark truth of our kind: a relentless pursuit of self-aggrandizement, a covetousness that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a scathing exposé by Upton Sinclair, lays bare the putrid underbelly of our species, where the baser instincts of greed and avarice hold sway. The masters of industry, those self-proclaimed titans of progress, care not a whit for the ravaged earth, the suffering masses, or the unspeakable indignities inflicted upon them. Theirs is a calculus of profit and loss, a ledger that reckons the worth of human life in the penny-pinching language of the bottom line.\n\nAs Sinclair bares the anatomy of Packingtown, we behold the hideous visage of our own depravity: the factories, those steel monoliths that belch forth their noxious fumes into the very air we breathe, leave in their wake a trail of desolation, a scarred and barren landscape that cries out for redemption. The proprietors and managers, those latter-day Philistines, regard the world with all the compassion of a winter's night, cold, unforgiving, and devoid of mercy.\n\nTheir employees, those toiling masses, are but mere cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and expendable, their lives reduced to a mere statistic in the ledger of progress. The hours are long, the toil is backbreaking, and the pay is meager, but the owners care not a whit, for they are the ones who reap the benefits of their sweat and toil. The unions, those supposed champions of the working class, prove to be little more than parasites, preying upon the very workers they claim to represent.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the stark realization that, in the end, we are not much better than slaves, our lives bound to the whims of those who would exploit us for their own gain. The Jungle is a cold, unforgiving mirror held up to our faces, a reminder that, deep down, we are all but beasts, driven by our baser instincts, our humanity reduced to naught but a distant memory, lost in the black smoke that chokes our cities and our souls.",
            "In the realm of literary craftsmanship, authors employ a multitude of techniques to inscribe their readers with a particular sentiment or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these methods prove more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, wields a plethora of these techniques with deft precision. He often pairs an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner, imbuing the subject with a certain aura. Sometimes, he assigns meaning to a symbol, only to utilize it for the same purpose with calculated effect. \n\nFitzgerald's utilization of colors is a striking example of this technique. He builds meaning for colors like white and gray, often pairing them together to convey a sense of uniformity. These colors take on a nuanced significance as the novel progresses, with Fitzgerald employing them to evoke a particular sentiment around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white with a sense of uniformity, and gray with a more aged and faded quality, is established early in the novel. He reinforces this meaning through repeated use of both colors in the narrative. The character of Daisy and her acquaintances are often described as \"in white,\" as if it were an inherent trait, a constant in their lives. Nick, too, wears \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, while Tom dons a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Even the landscape itself is not immune to these colors: Nick traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work. Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"gray name\" on Nick's timetable or a \"white girlhood\" shared by Jordan and Daisy.\n\nWith sufficient meaning assigned to these colors, Fitzgerald begins to employ them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding certain subjects. This technique is first applied to Daisy, whose appearance in a \"little white roadster\" after an extended absence from the narrative serves to render her a more uniform, less substantial character, a mere object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly to emphasize Daisy's role as a symbol of uniformity, as in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" or her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nIn this way, Fitzgerald masterfully employs color to craft a particular atmosphere around his characters and settings, subtly influencing the reader's perception of the narrative's themes and motifs. His use of white and gray serves as a testament to the power of language in shaping our understanding of the world, and the author's ability to wield this power with precision and effect.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, a land of sun-baked hills and verdant valleys, the earth yields its bounty with a generosity born of a mild and benevolent climate. Here, in the fertile crescent of the East County Southern Foothills, the landowner tills the rich soil, coaxing forth an abundance of succulent delights: plump tomatoes, luscious lemons, emerald greens, and the velvety softness of squash, broccoli, and herbs. The air is heavy with the sweet scent of ripening peaches and the delicate perfume of berries, while the gentle hum of bees as they tend to the honeycombs is a soothing serenade to the land.\n\nYet, in this Eden of plenty, there lies a paradox. Amidst the profusion of life, a fragility exists, a delicate balance that can be shattered by the careless hand. The landowner, aware of this fragility, seeks to walk the fine line between profit and preservation, aware that the allure of organic farming holds both promise and peril. The lure of government programs and lucrative markets beckons, yet the path of conventional farming beckons with its efficiency and scale, leaving the landowner to ponder the intricate dance between the needs of the land and the demands of the market.\n\nIn the scrubby landscape of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, the landowner's parcel of 160 acres stands as a testament to the region's storied past. Once home to the indigenous peoples who walked this land for untold centuries, it was later claimed by the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers of the late 1800s. The original homestead patent that deeded this land to its current steward holds secrets of a bygone era, whispers of a time when the land was a verdant tapestry of grazing lands and woodlots.\n\nIn this crucible of history and ecology, the landowner seeks to forge a new path, one that balances the needs of the market with the imperatives of the land. Drawing inspiration from the nearby Cleveland National Forest and the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the landowner strives to create a haven for the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as the burrowing owls whose numbers are dwindling. In this delicate web of life, the landowner seeks to find a harmony between profit and preservation, aware that the land itself holds the secrets to a sustainable future.\n\nWith each passing season, the landowner tends the land with care and devotion, aware that the gentle whispers of the past hold the key to a future of abundance and vitality. In this arid landscape, where the sun beats down and the soil thirsts for moisture, the landowner seeks to quench its thirst, to bring forth a verdant tapestry of life that will sustain generations to come.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, casting the land in a warm, golden light, the landowner knows that the land holds a secret: that the delicate balance between profit and preservation is not a zero-sum game, but a harmonious marriage of two opposing forces, each one enriching the other in a dance of life and death, of growth and decay. In this crucible of light and shadow, the landowner seeks to find the perfect balance, to create a haven of life in a world of scarcity, where the land itself holds the secrets to a future of abundance and vitality.",
            "The labyrinthine nature of culture lies at the core of any negotiation. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture defies homogeneity, its contours shifting like the sands of a forgotten hourglass. The broad strokes of generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" do little justice to the intricate complexities of a world where nothing is singular or uniform.\n\nWhen traversing the uncharted territories of a foreign culture, one cannot help but be drawn into the realm of the familiar, with comparisons forming like ripples on a still pond. To grasp the essence of a culture, one must delve into its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or altering, but of accepting it for what it is, and navigating its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high and the bargaining position tenuous.\n\nThe dichotomy of national and international cultures is a false one, for within the walls of any given nation, a multitude of corporate cultures thrives. A company's culture can be as stifling as it is liberating, with its own brand of tyranny or utopia. The signs are there, in the dress codes that dictate modesty or audacity, in the communication styles that prioritize directness or subtlety, and in the hiring practices that value talent or pedigree. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork quilt, with companies weaving their own unique narratives from threadbare threads of ingenuity and duplicity. And yet, even within these seemingly monolithic entities, diversity lurks, a subterranean world of conflicting values and interests waiting to be unearthed.\n\nValues, the hidden architecture of culture, hold the key to understanding the why behind a people's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are sacred tenets in a culture, then a negotiator must tread with care, lest they inadvertently offend or disrupt the delicate balance. Conversely, a culture that places its faith in the art of the hard bargain will not be swayed by concessions or compromise. To succeed, a negotiator must don the cloak of empathy, learning to see the world through the eyes of their opponent, to grasp the personal stakes that drive them forward. Only then can the labyrinth of culture be navigated, and the art of negotiation mastered.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a lone voice whispers a refrain: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase, an echo of Psalm 14, finds its way into the writings of St. Anselm, a beacon of faith amidst the darkness. It is a notion that also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, a seeker of truth in a world beset by shadow. Both men, in their quest for the divine, weave arguments that dance upon the fringes of reason and faith. Yet, in their zeal to prove the existence of a God, they falter in their grasp of the whole.\n\nLet us begin with St. Anselm's creed, a path that winds inward, seeking answers within the recesses of the soul. He posits that the proof of God's existence lies within the mind's own labyrinth, a realm where truth is forged in the crucible of understanding. The nonexistence of God, to Anselm, is a notion that cannot be conceived, a void that defies the very fabric of our being. In this, he suggests that the search for God is not an external endeavor, but an introspective journey, where the truth lies hidden within the recesses of the self.\n\nThis notion of faith, a reliance on the unseen, is a thread that weaves through Christian texts, a testament to the power of the human spirit. Yet, it is a concept that stands in stark contrast to the rationalist's creed, that of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas, driven by a desire to prove the existence of God through the lens of reason, presents five arguments that seek to pierce the veil of uncertainty. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each a stepping stone on the path to the divine.\n\nIn this, Aquinas seeks to persuade, to convince the doubter that the existence of God is not a matter of faith, but of logic. The missing piece of the puzzle, though unseen, can be inferred through the careful assembly of the rest. Yet, in their pursuit of the divine, both men falter, their arguments incomplete, their understanding of the whole imperfect. Like two travelers lost in a wilderness, they strain to see beyond the horizon, yet the truth eludes them, a mirage on the horizon of the human condition.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a figure emerged, one who would come to be known as the Buddha. His birth, a mere whisper in the annals of the past, a faint tremor in the sands of the forgotten. A prince, a wanderer, a seeker of truth. The world, a labyrinth of suffering, of desire, of hatred, of delusion. He roamed, a pilgrim in a world bereft of solace, until he found the path. The path of the Buddha, a narrow, winding road that led to the precipice of enlightenment.\n\nTime, a merciless taskmaster, wore down the rough edges of the world, leaving in its wake the smooth, weathered stones of tradition. Theravada Buddhism, the most austere of the Buddha's teachings, a sect born of the fires of the past, tempered by the hammer of the ages. In the crucible of time, the religion was purified, its core doctrine burning bright like a coal in the darkness.\n\nIn the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a ceremony was observed, a water-cutting celebration, a ritual born not of the Buddha's teachings, but of the necessities of the world. Monks and laymen alike participated, their footsteps echoing through the empty streets, a distant memory of a forgotten past. The ceremony, a thin thread in the tapestry of tradition, a reminder that the Buddha's teachings were but a starting point, a foundation upon which the edifice of the religion was built.\n\nForces, both internal and external, hostile and benign, shaped the course of the religion. The internal forces, born of the members of the Buddhasasana, a community of seekers, of monks and laymen, who struggled to maintain the purity of the doctrine. The external forces, a maelstrom of influences, a tide of ideas, of cultures, of histories, that threatened to engulf the fragile flower of the faith.\n\nIn the depths of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist text, lay the core of the religion. The Sutta Pitaka, a collection of sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, a codex of disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a treatise on the metaphysical components of the faith. Anatta, the doctrine of no soul, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, these were the building blocks of the religion.\n\nThe four noble truths, the foundation of the Buddha's teachings, a simple, yet profound, doctrine. Dukkha, the truth of suffering, the second truth, that attachment causes suffering, and the third, that suffering can be overcome. The path to enlightenment, a winding road, fraught with peril, yet beset on all sides by the siren call of desire, of hatred, of delusion.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, in the darkness of the forest, the Buddha's words echoed through the ages, a call to the seeker, a whispered promise of liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. The Theravada community, a fragile, flickering flame, threatened by the winds of time, yet burning brightly, a beacon in the darkness, a testament to the power of the Buddha's teachings.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, a struggle unfolded between two nations, the United States and Mexico. Their enduring enmity, forged in the depths of history, spanned 57 years, a prolonged and arduous test of wills. The tumultuous saga of their rivalry reached its zenith in the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the landscape and left an indelible mark on the American Southwest. The echoes of that war still resonated long after its conclusion, casting a pall of animosity over the shared borders of the two nations.\n\nA maelstrom of competing interests, fueled by clashing values and traditions, had set the stage for this rivalry. The divide between the two nations was further exacerbated by the incompatibility of their material pursuits, a chasm that seemed insurmountable. The stakes were high, and the tension between the two nations was palpable, a powder keg waiting to be ignited.\n\nLike the rusting hulks of abandoned ships, other nations had been shipwrecked on the rocky shores of history, their once-promising relationships reduced to nothing more than a distant memory. The United States and Mexico, however, were not so fortunate, their tumultuous past a constant reminder of the perils of animosity. David M. Pletcher's words, etched in the annals of history, served as a stark reminder: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" The proximity of these nations to the United States only served to heighten the sense of unease, a constant reminder of the fragility of their relations.\n\nThe bitter pill of religious intolerance had poisoned the well of their diplomacy, a festering wound that refused to heal. Sally Frahm's words, a poignant reminder of the past, echoed through the ages: \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The ideological chasm that yawned between the two nations was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, a testament to the enduring power of dogma.\n\nThe legacy of distrust, inherited from their colonial past, weighed heavily upon the two nations, a millstone that threatened to engulf them both. The weight of their shared history, a burden they could not shake, had sapped the life from their relations, leaving only a husk of what once was. Diehl and Goerts' list of 17 disputes, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by their rivalry, served as a testament to the enduring power of their animosity.\n\nAs the years passed, the rivalry finally began to subside, its embers slowly extinguished by the gentle rains of time. Mexico's dependence on the United States had become a fait accompli, a reality that could no longer be denied. Schmitt's words, a cold comfort to those who had lived through the tumult, served as a reminder that even the most intractable of conflicts can eventually come to an end: \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (Schmitt 1974, p. 109). The rivalry, once a burning fire that had threatened to consume them both, had finally been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.",
            "Fifteen years of desolation had ravaged my body, a silence where once there was strength. It began without warning, an unwelcome guest that would not depart. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the vulnerable, a sentinel of the sick. The promise of security had drawn me to this vocation, a shield against the tempests of my own childhood. My heart had whispered to me in the darkness: \"You will always find a place to stand, a roof to shelter beneath.\" And so I chose the path of the healer, though my true desires had lain elsewhere.\n\nThe scientist, the journalist – these were the voices that had whispered in my ear, urging me to explore the unknown, to seek the truth. But I had silenced them, taming the wild within. Fifteen years of living on the frayed threads of Social Security Disability had stripped me bare, leaving naught but the echoes of what once was. Every day a struggle, a battle against the void that yawned within. My family, my friends – they had been my lifeline, my fragile thread of hope in the darkness. And when disaster struck, it was not the strength of my own heart that saw me through, but the kindness of those who stood beside me.\n\nThis, I have come to understand, is the truth of the human condition. We are not islands, unmoored and alone. We are a tapestry, intricately woven, each strand connected to the next. And when the storms of life assail us, it is not our individual fortitude that will see us through, but the bonds we have forged with one another.\n\nI do not advocate for the rejection of preparedness. A disaster kit, a first aid kit, a cache of supplies – these are wise preparations for the uncertainties of life. But let us not forget the most essential resource of all: the human heart. Let us not confuse self-reliance with the cold, hard stone of isolation. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the Rockies, but the warmth of community, the generosity of strangers, and the love that bound them together.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Stockpile your supplies, hone your skills, and learn to tend the fire of compassion within yourself. But as you do, also tend the fires of connection that bind us all. For when the darkness closes in, it is not our individual candles that will light the way, but the collective flame of our shared humanity.",
            "In the dark of the universe, a question lingers, a whispered query that echoes through the void: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints, hidden shackles that govern the direction of change? It is a question that has haunted the minds of scholars for centuries, a puzzle that has resisted the efforts of even the most brilliant minds. As D'Arcy Thompson once said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so we find ourselves in a similar predicament, struggling to grasp the intricacies of life's unfolding tapestry.\n\nBut it is in the realm of mollusks, those creatures of the ancient earth, that we may find a glimpse of the answers we seek. Through the lens of mathematical modeling, we have endeavored to unravel the mysteries of Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep. Our study, a testament to the power of human ingenuity, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern evolution's pace, that subtle dance of life and death.\n\nWe began by delving into the realm of X-radiography, that wondrous tool that reveals the hidden truths of the shell. Like a mapmaker charting the unseen territories of a new world, we sought to delineate the parameters that govern the shell's morphology. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into the fabric of our mathematical model, CerioShell. With this tool, we crafted hypothetical scenarios, possibilities that danced like specters in the void, waiting to be interpreted.\n\nAnd so we turned to the shell, that most ancient and enigmatic of forms. A tube that traverses the realm of time, a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each revolution, each turn of the shell, a whorl that spirals around the central axis, the columella. A continuous line, a suture, separates each whorl, a boundary that marks the passage of time. And at the apex of this spiral, the largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel, a testament to the shell's enduring presence.\n\nWe may view the shell from different perspectives, apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a window into the secrets of the shell's structure. And it is here, in the realm of the aperture, that we find the key to understanding the shell's trajectory, its path through time and space.\n\nLike a thread unwinding from a spool, the aperture travels through the ages, a series of coordinates that chart the shell's growth. And it is this trajectory that we have sought to graphically and mathematically represent, a dance of numbers and lines that reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nBut our work is far from over. For in the realm of the shell, we find not only the secrets of the past, but also the keys to the future. And so we continue to modify the parameters, to vary the variables, to see how the shell's skeletogenesis responds to the whims of chance and necessity. In this grand experiment, we are but mere players, instruments of a greater design, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe, one shell at a time.",
            "In the vast expanse of Indonesia's landscape, a quiet crisis simmers, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of the nation's health. The rates of neonatal and infant mortality, a bloody stain on the otherwise hopeful narrative of development, remain stubbornly static, refusing to yield to the ceaseless push of progress. Like a withered vine, they cling to the soil, a testament to the entrenched problems that plague the country's maternal and child health. The Millennium Development Goals, once a beacon of hope, now seem an unattainable dream, their targets slipping further and further from grasp.\n\nA glimmer of light flickers in the darkness, a 72% of births attended by skilled health workers, a number that masks the truth, for it includes traditional practitioners, unprepared to face the complications that can arise. The numbers whisper sweet nothings of improvement, but the reality is far more dire, with maternal deaths claiming their victims like a merciless harvest. The statistics on diarrheal cases in children under five, a grim reminder of the unforgiving power of disease, tell a tale of neglect and abandonment.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a frail reed, bends before the wind, a paltry 4%, a stark reminder of the inadequacies of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The urban-rural divide, a chasm that yawns wide and deep, reveals the ugly truth of unequal access to care, a reflection of a system that favors the fortunate few, while condemning the many to the cold, unforgiving darkness of neglect. The vertical equity gap, a precipice that threatens to swallow all, stands at 27%, a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by the poor in accessing the very services that could save their lives.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the specter of neonatal and maternal mortality, the question hangs in the air like a challenge, how to bridge the yawning chasm of care. Shall Indonesia succumb to the siren song of programmatic approaches, targeting specific sectors, or shall it strive to strengthen the very foundations of its health system, a stone upon stone, a pyramid of care that reaches up to the heavens? The siren's call is seductive, promising quick fixes and tangible results, but at what cost? The drawbacks are legion, a hydra-like monster that devours resources, siphons talent, and spawns duplication and disarray.\n\nIn the end, the choice is not a simple one, a binary decision between two paths, but a labyrinthine puzzle that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to confront the darkness that lies at the heart of Indonesia's health crisis. The journey ahead will be long and arduous, but it is a journey that must be taken, for the sake of the children, the mothers, and the very soul of the nation.",
            "In the labyrinthine recesses of the Victorian era, a peculiar dichotomy emerged – novels that eschewed the traditional trappings of the aristocracy and instead delved into the depths of the human experience. Two such outliers are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, novels that defied convention with their enthralling mysteries and unflinching portrayals of the bizarre. Like twisted threads, these novels wove intricate narratives that probed the innermost recesses of their characters, casting a flickering light on their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the protagonist navigated the treacherous landscape of his own mind, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred. The cacophony of his thoughts grew louder, an unrelenting maelstrom of emotions and ideas that threatened to consume him whole. The words of Sikes and Crackit still lingered in his mind, their acrimonious dispute lingering like a ghostly presence. He stumbled backward, shocked by the report of firearms, as the world around him dissolved into chaos – lights blurring, sounds jarring, and an unseen force propelling him forward.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, an unspoken awareness of pain seared his consciousness, an unrelenting torment that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employed this technique of mystery to illuminate the inner workings of their characters. Through dream sequences and states of altered consciousness, these novels plumbed the depths of their subjects, revealing the hidden recesses of their psyches. In Oliver Twist, these dreamlike episodes served as a window into Oliver's inner world, a realm where his deepest fears and insecurities lay bare.\n\nThe shooting of Oliver Twist, revisited in chapter 28, served as a catalyst for this narrative. As Oliver relived the event, his senses numbed by the trauma, he struggled to find solace in a world that seemed determined to crush him. The unseen hand that bore him away was a potent symbol of his loss of control, a stark reminder that he was powerless to shape his own destiny. The perpetual pain that gnawed at his consciousness served as a constant reminder of his vulnerability, a vulnerability that had been exploited by the forces of darkness that surrounded him.\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming despair, the question arose – whose will had brought about his downfall? Was it his own, or the machinations of those who sought to control him? The shooting served as a testament to Oliver's growing sense of defeat, a defeat that had been insidiously insinuated by the forces of oppression that had worn him down.\n\nAs the darkness closed in, the world seemed to shrink, its boundaries compressing into an endless expanse of silence and desolation. The passing of time became a distant memory, a fleeting whisper in the void. And in this void, the characters of these novels struggled to find meaning, their lives reduced to a series of fragmented moments, suspended in the eternal twilight of uncertainty.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of the human experience, these novels stood as beacons of hope, illuminating the darkest recesses of the human heart. They dared to venture into the unknown, to confront the mysteries that lay beyond the boundaries of conventional narrative. And in doing so, they created works of profound beauty, works that continue to haunt us to this day.",
            "The shadows crept across the worn linoleum of the after-school program, a faint reminder of the day's passage. I had worked there, tutoring the younger ones, my strength lying in the realm of English and the written word. The boy, Adrian, a third or fourth grader, had been assigned to me, his struggles with reading a puzzle I sought to unravel. It started with the alphabets, the letters that danced upon the page, yet to him, a riddle. He would pronounce some with ease, while others defied him, a stark contrast that left me perplexed. His mother, a woman of unspoken words, entered our world one fateful day, her silence a testament to the language barrier that stood between us. Our communication, a halting dance of gestures and broken phrases.\n\nThe truth dawned on me like a winter's dawn, a slow and gradual realization: Adrian's struggles lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet. His proficiency in speech, a spoken language, belied his struggle with the written word. Though he spoke English with clarity, the written form eluded him. In that moment, I grasped the complexity of the issue, a problem that persisted long after our meetings.\n\nThat tale I recount, a testament to the unseen struggles of the language barrier, particularly in the state of California. It is a problem that defies easy solutions, a tangled web of complexities that require a multifaceted approach. In Adrian's case, the answer lay in targeted tutoring, a concentrated effort to teach him the English alphabet and pronunciation. Yet, for those who barely speak the language, the solution proves far more elusive.\n\nThe dual language system, a concept often met with skepticism, holds promise. Not limited to children of Spanish descent, it benefits all, as studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Fears of wasted resources and limited benefits are unfounded. If implemented as a standard, rather than an exception, all children would reap its rewards. But how to achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, a daunting expectation. However, the presence of bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever one may call them, is a reasonable and realistic solution.\n\nIn the end, the answer lies not in a single approach, but in a fusion of methods, a harmonious blend of ESL classes, private tutors, and mainstream immersion. It is a challenge that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to adapt. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, can be bridged, but it demands a collective effort, a shared understanding that the solutions lie not in isolation, but in cooperation.",
            "In the earliest of hours, we are fed a notion that there is a vastness beyond our own, a reality that defies comprehension.  Some are schooled in its presence, others seek it within the confines of their own minds, and still, others reject its very existence. The paths we choose are as varied as the stars that fill the night sky. We seek a beacon to guide us through the shadows, a light to lead us into the warmth of the sun.\n\nMy father's voice cut through the rain pounding the tin roof of our porch like a dirge. He stared out into the gray, his eyes a mix of longing and remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging listlessly from his frame like a specter. His hair, once a rich abundance, now thinned and sparse. I felt a cold dread, a weight that pressed upon my chest. Our conversation hung in the air like the rain, heavy with unspoken words. I reached out, my arms wrapping around him, a futile attempt to hold onto the man who was slipping away from me. We sat in silence, our eyes fixed on the rain, the sound a cadence that echoed through my mind.\n\nFive days after my twenty-second birthday, he was gone. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but not eased it. I had not been present for his passing. I could not bear to witness the end of the man who had given me life. Instead, I remembered him by the laughter, the stories, the love. The thought of a God who would allow such a fate was a cruel joke. I did not pray in the darkness, for I knew He had stopped listening long ago.\n\nIn the days that followed, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news that would come. The silence was deafening. No one called. It was as if the world had moved on, leaving me behind. I lay there, lost in the shadows, my heart heavy with grief.",
            "In a paradoxical marriage of the antique and the modern, the Gothic Novel emerges, an oxymoronic fusion of the bygone and the new. Ian Watt aptly describes it as a \"Gothic Novel\" - an antithesis of the novel's own rising ascendancy (Watt). Blasted by scorn and praise, the Gothic mode is accused of vacuity and lauded for its ability to conjure an aura of the terrible sublime (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, brokers a union of the archaic and the novelistic, forging a new literary discourse. Walpole weaves together venerable theatrical elements and the artificial simulation of nature, yielding what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, a palimpsest of medieval theatricality, architecture, and tradition, is replete with throwbacks to a bygone era. Even in the era of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the word \"Gothic\" was a catch-all term, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was regarded as a relic of a bygone age, a fossil of a more unsophisticated time. The confluence of the Gothic's theatrical leanings and the novel's novelistic innovations allowed it to endure, even as it became anachronistic, a relic of a bygone era, yet simultaneously novel and fresh to a reader dislocated from the original text.\n\nAt the heart of the Gothic Novel lies the concept of Chivalry, an abstraction of medieval valor, which is both retained and transmuted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the catechism of the virtuous knight, is a lodestar for Gothic writers, a beacon of honor, valor, and competence in a world perceived as morally bankrupt (Walpole). Through the prism of Chivalry, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the nascent Romantic movement. Walpole, a man beset by the troubles of his time, wrote The Castle of Otranto as a cri de coeur, a lament for the lost virtues of a bygone era. His writing is a cri de coeur, a plea for the rediscovery of the nobility and integrity that he perceived as having been lost in the mire of his contemporaries. In Frederic, Walpole crafts a character who embodies the chivalric ideal. His description is a litany of traditional chivalric tropes: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a knight, beset by the vicissitudes of fate. The figure of the gallant and courteous knight is, of course, an exaggeration, a trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "In the desolate wasteland of commerce, where the wind howls like a mournful cry, supply chain management emerges as a behemoth, a behemoth born from the fertile soil of necessity. Its genesis dates back to 1982, when Keith Oliver, a sage of industry, first coined the term. Like a prophet proclaiming the arrival of a new era, Oliver described the grand symphony of processes that unfold from customer order to raw materials, production, and distribution. The aim: to satiate the void of customer needs with an efficiency that borders on the efficient.\n\nSix pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce wield these pillars to conjure a symphony of customer satisfaction. But what is production, the first and most vital of these pillars? Production is the foundation, the bedrock upon which the entire edifice stands. It is the time, place, and manner in which goods are brought forth. Only by listening to the whispers of the market can managers divine the desires of the customer. The market, a fickle mistress, beckons the manager to decipher its secrets, to unravel the mysteries of demand. And once the veil is lifted, the manager must decide what products to birth, how many to produce, and where and when to birth them. The production stage is a delicate waltz, a dance of schedules and equipment maintenance, a ballet of precision and detail.\n\nBut the rhythm of production is not the only beat in this grand symphony. Supply, the second pillar, is a symphony of strategic decisions, a harmonious union of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Like a master conductor, the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product, and when to outsource, to create a melody of velocity – a symphony of quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn the retail temples of Wal-Mart and Target, the design of production, inventory, and logistics is a testament to the power of well-crafted processes. Like a well-planned ritual, every step is choreographed to minimize confusion and maximize efficiency. And thus, the supply chain management, this grand symphony, unfolds, a majestic dance of production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, all orchestrated to satiate the customer's insatiable hunger.",
            "A faded sign stood crookedly in the dusty air, a weathered piece of cardboard held aloft by an unseen hand. Ellen Page, a star of a world now long gone, stood isolated on a forgotten street, her eyes cast down at the scribbled message scrawled upon her makeshift placard. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the letters stark and black against the pale canvas. Burma, a land shrouded in an aura of oppression, a Southeastern Asian nation ruled by a regime of unforgiving steel. The year was some distant past, a time when protests raged like wildfires, when monks in rust-colored robes marched through the streets, their chanting a call to arms against the iron fist of the military junta.\n\nIt was a time of blood and fire, of screams in the darkness and the scent of smoke. The monks, once revered for their wisdom and compassion, now walked the thin line between peace and anarchy. The government, its grip on power like a vice, squeezed tighter with each passing day. Foreign journalists, witnesses to the carnage, were rounded up and cast into the depths of some forsaken prison. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell to the ground, his life extinguished by a single bullet, simply for bearing witness to the chaos.\n\nBut Burma was not an isolated case. Throughout the ages, governments had sought to snuff out dissent, to maintain their hold on the masses. The early Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, ruled with an iron fist, their decrees absolute and unyielding. The Japanese emperors, deities in a land of rising suns, claimed divine right to lead their people to prosperity, even as they walked the thin line between life and death. And in a world far removed from these distant lands, a leader, a man of power and influence, held weekly conference calls with a self-proclaimed prophet, a man who spoke of a world divided, a world of the faithful and the damned.\n\nTiananmen Square, a place of blood and memory, echoed with the whispers of the past. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students, bound together by a shared desire for freedom, stood united against the crushing weight of their oppressors. The death toll was a number shrouded in mystery, a figure that danced between 200 and 3,000, a statistic that only served to fuel the fires of outrage. The Rwandan genocide, a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, left a trail of death and despair in its wake, a reminder that the human heart is capable of atrocities beyond comprehension.\n\nAnd Hitler's Third Reich, a monstrosity of a bygone era, stood as a testament to the darkest corners of the human soul. A time of unspeakable horrors, of gas chambers and crematoria, of children orphaned and women widowed, a time when the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder.\n\nThe world had changed, yet the cycle of oppression remained. The faces and places changed, but the story remained the same. And on this forgotten street, this forgotten sign, the words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" stood as a grim reminder of a world forever trapped in the cycle of blood and fire.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington's legacy stretches far across the expanse of jazz, a testament to his unyielding vitality and creative might. Like a river that refuses to be stilled, Ellington's artistry flowed on through the years, shaping the contours of his orchestra and birthing works that would come to define the genre. Though his presence at the piano was often understated, Ellington's compositional prowess knew no bounds, as he wove intricate patterns that allowed his musicians to unfurl their talents like a blooming flower.\n\nA master craftsman, Ellington constructed the framework upon which his soloists could improvise, their notes dancing like leaves on a autumn breeze. He penned phrases that coaxed the unique timbres of each band member to the fore, blending them into a harmonious whole that was greater than the sum of its parts. In doing so, he conjured sounds that were both original and timeless, a testament to his profound understanding of the orchestra's sonic tapestry.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, a notion first glimpsed in the haunting Creole Love Call. This early masterpiece, a slow and deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's predilection for using the human voice as a textural element, untethered from the shackles of lyrics. Within its six choruses, we find a testament to Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait that would come to define his oeuvre.\n\nChorus 1: A dialogue of sorts, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice unfolding like a morning mist, growing rougher towards the end like the first wisps of dawn.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo, its notes spinning out like the threads of a spider's web, as it elaborates on the basic melody and stretches towards the fringes of sound.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo, soaring like a bird set free, backed by a subtle piano phrase that weaves in and out of the shadows.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, the brass and reed sections trading call and response like the ebb and flow of a river.\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance, the reeds take center stage, their call and response unfolding like a great tapestry, as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus, the voice now taking on the growl of a distant dog, soloing like an instrumental virtuoso.\nTag: A final, fleeting tag, a vocal run and a dissonant trombone phrase that hangs in the air like the last wisps of a departing storm.\n\nEllington's predilection for using voice as a dimensional element is but one aspect of his stylistic hallmarks, a thread that weaves its way through his oeuvre like a river through the earth. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color, as \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response that is at once both vocal and instrumental. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), with its wondrous trombone introduction by Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, extends these ideas, illuminating the complex interplay between texture, tone, and rhythm that define Ellington's greatest works.",
            "She felt a hollowness within her, an ache that gnawed at the marrow of her soul. It had begun to manifest when she was but a girl, around the age of fourteen, as her world began to unravel with the tangles of adolescence. The feeling persisted, a stubborn ember that refused to be extinguished, even as the years passed and she entered the threshold of womanhood at seventeen. Her desire had grown from an abstract longing to a yearning for something - or someone - tangible, yet she found herself immune to the entreaties of boys who sought to woo her. Their clumsy advances only served to confound her, leaving her to ponder the enigma of her own heart. Theories sprouted like weeds in her mind, but none offered a satisfying explanation for this peculiarity. And so she wandered, a stranger in her own skin, questioning the depths of her own desires.\n\nAt home, her days were typically a tranquil affair. Her parents, a paragon of calm, rarely raised their voices, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. Their disagreements, when they did arise, centered on her defiant individuality, a spirit that seemed to thrive on the energies of her parents' serenity. But today was different. As she roamed the house, seeking inspiration from the void within, a shrill cry pierced the air, followed by her mother's anguished voice. She sprinted toward the kitchen, a sense of trepidation building in her chest. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice cracking with concern. Her mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, the words tumbling from her lips in short, labored breaths. \"Ow... sweet... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother's words were laced with desperation, and her daughter's heart swelled with a sense of duty. With a Herculean effort, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradling her in her arms, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's sterile corridors and antiseptic smells assaulted her senses, but her mind was consumed by worry for her mother. She hastened to the reception area, her voice rising above the din of the hospital, calling out for assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around, and a doctor swiftly arrived to escort her mother to a bed. As the medical staff tended to her mother's wounds, she was left to sit, her anxiety simmering like a pot about to boil over.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "In a desolate expanse of time, a study unfolded like a parched and withered leaf, tracing the enigmatic thread of fate that binds the adherents of the Mediterranean Diet to a diminished risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" a variant of the revered Med diet, unfolded its mysteries, a tapestry woven from the threads of higher plant food consumption, monounsaturated fat, and fish, against the somber backdrop of reduced animal products and saturated fats. Moderate indulgence in alcohol was permitted, a fleeting respite from the unyielding strictures of the diet.\n\nEpidemiological endeavors past had whispered promises of an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of total and cardiovascular mortality. Intervention trials had proven the diet's efficacy in guiding obese individuals toward weight loss and a more favorable ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Yet, the realm of stroke and stroke mortality remained uncharted, a siren's call to the present study.\n\nWithin the vast expanse of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, and without the blight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were drawn into the orbit of this study. Six epochs, spanning 20 years, witnessed the computation of an aMed diet score, culled from the self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) that chronicled the participants' nutrient intake over the preceding year. The majority of these nurses persisted in their participation, an unbroken thread of commitment.\n\nThese FFQs, subject to validation studies, were the keys to unlocking the secrets of the diet's efficacy. Reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were cross-checked against medical records, hospital documents, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where records were wanting, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, representing a small fraction of the total strokes and myocardial infarcts.\n\nThe variables of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, while leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986. To mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and to reflect the long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were computed, averaging the scores from two preceding years.\n\nThe confounders, those insidious factors that could subvert the results, were accounted for by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical incantation, was employed to chart the association between the aMed score and the risks of chronic heart disease and stroke, distinguishing between fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The outcome was a revelation: greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The passage of 20 years bore witness to 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile stood at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke, with a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In the depths of a nation, a wound festered, its putrid flesh spilling forth a stench that would one day engulf all. The year was 2007, a time when the very fabric of America's economy began to unravel. The once-mighty edifice of financial prowess came crashing down, leaving in its wake a desolate expanse of shattered dreams and broken lives. The question lingers: what calamity befell this behemoth, this leviathan of industry and progress?\n\nA closer examination reveals the genesis of this devastation: the reckless and shortsighted dealings of those who wielded power. Banks and corporations, driven by avarice and a fervent desire for growth, were goaded into issuing sub-prime loans, flooding the market with toxic debt that would eventually poison the very arteries of the economy. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those twin titans of the financial world, were coerced into buying and repackaging these defective mortgages, creating an intricate web of CDOs and CDSs that would ensnare the entire nation.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the fertile soil of the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. The stage was thus set for the impending disaster, a catastrophe that would unfold seven years later like a slow-motion train wreck. As the New York Times' Steven Holmes astutely observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes' prophetic words would come to haunt the nation, as the government-subsidized corporation careened towards the abyss, threatening a repeat of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\n\nA complex tapestry of factors contributed to the unraveling of the economy, including the proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial alchemy concoctions intertwined the nation's economy, ensnaring households and financial markets alike in a web of debt that would prove as fragile as spun sugar. The result was a nation awash in leverage, its citizens and financial institutions perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable happened: the housing bubble burst, releasing a torrent of toxic waste that drowned the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. The once-mighty Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, submitting to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were crippled by a $5 trillion mortgage debt, their fate sealed when they were placed under government control in September 2008.\n\nAs the nation struggled to come to terms with the devastation, a haunting question lingered: how could so many have been so blind to the perils of their own creations? How could the very instruments of progress have been twisted into instruments of destruction? The answer, like the nation itself, was complex, multifaceted, and ultimately, heartbreaking.",
            "He'd sat at his desk, hands clasped together as if in prayer, staring at the blank page before him. The dim fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in tandem with the flashes of self-doubt that coursed through his mind. Ah, the siren song of exposition, beckoning him toward the shoals of tedious prose. He knew the drill, the faint whisper in his ear that urged him to reveal the entire backstory of his characters, to dump the history into the reader's lap like a laundry basket overflowing with dirty socks.\n\nBut he knew better. He knew that exposition, like the devil on his shoulder, was a temptress, promising a shortcut through the woods of storytelling. He'd see authors fall prey to her wiles, their narratives bogged down in a sea of unnecessary details, their readers fleeing in search of more engaging fare. Dr. Merlin, his instructor, had once shouted at her monitor, no doubt, when she found herself stuck in a quagmire of Too Much Information.\n\nAnd so he took a deep breath, forced his mind to focus, and wrote. \"Show, don't tell,\" he reminded himself, a mantra he'd learned long ago. He wrote a sentence, then another, and another, each one a small, incremental step forward in the story. He didn't tell the reader about the character's past; he showed it through the curve of a smile, the glint in the eye, the way the character's hands moved with a practiced ease.\n\nAs he wrote, the words began to flow, a gentle stream that wound its way through the story, carrying the reader along with it. He wrote of the character's first meeting with the heroine, the way their eyes met across the crowded room, the way their hands touched, sending a spark of electricity through the air. He didn't tell the reader about their romance; he showed it in the way they laughed together, the way they held each other close.\n\nAnd when the character's husband was killed, the reader felt the loss deeply, not just because of the fact of his death, but because of the way it had changed the heroine, the way it had revealed her true character. The reader mourned with her, and in doing so, was drawn deeper into the story, more invested in the heroine's journey.\n\nExposition, he knew, was a necessary evil, a way to provide context, to give the reader a sense of the world the story is set in. But it was a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk. Too much, and the reader would nod off, the story lost in a sea of unnecessary details. Too little, and the reader would be left in the dark, struggling to make sense of the narrative.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He'd walked the tightrope, and come out on the other side, the words flowing smoothly, the story unfolding like a river. Exposition, he knew, was not his enemy, but a tool, a means to an end. And with practice, he knew he could learn to wield it with precision, to show, not tell, and keep his readers enthralled.",
            "He sat and watched the flickering images, the news broadcasts from a place called Columbus, Ohio. The first one, a live feed, was from a station called NBC 4, on a day that felt like a hundred years gone, August 13, 2011. The lead story was a man, a Shad Hostettler, who had committed a heinous act. He was shown in a picture, his face twisted, his eyes sunken, a visage of pure malevolence. The story was brief, a mere two minutes, as if the weight of it was too much to bear. They spoke of wounds, multiple, inflicted by the man's own hand, and of his subsequent arrest. It was a fleeting glimpse, a momentary glance into the abyss.\n\nThe next story was a haze of silence, a void where a young man's life hung in the balance. Travis Buyers, 18, lay critically injured, a victim of a senseless act of violence. The words swirled, a vortex of confusion, as the SWAT team combed through the streets, searching for answers. But the faces that stared back, the ones that mattered, were the ones that were ignored, the ones that were left to fade into the background. It was a tale of a different kind of violence, one that was all too familiar, a story of lives left unspoken.\n\nThe broadcasts stumbled onward, a jarring sequence of images and words. A helicopter, its metal shattered, a victim of a lone gunman. A .22 caliber bullet, a rifle's deadly kiss. The reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, a pitiful sum for a life. The next story, a tease, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a reminder that the world outside was still turning, still spinning out of control.\n\nAnd then, the focus shifted, the lens narrowing to a single, dark-skinned man, a thief in the night, a robber of a store. The words dripped with venom, a racist's venom, a poison that seeped into the very fabric of the broadcast. The man's height, his weight, his skin color, a litany of details, a litany of hate.\n\nA convicted man, a Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin, a dealer in death. The words flowed, a river of steel, a river of stone. Twenty-five years, 300 months, a sentence, a fate, a life, a life sentence. His skin, a shade of brown, a color, a label, a box to be checked. It was a story, a tale of a man, a man with a name, a man with a face, a man with a story that was left untold.\n\nHe sat, a prisoner of the screen, a prisoner of the words, a prisoner of the world. The images faded, the words dissolved, and he was left with a sense of despair, a sense of hopelessness. The world outside was a dark and twisted place, a place where lives were cheap, where stories were told, and where the faces of the forgotten were forever lost in the shadows.",
            "A bond of fraternal tethering binds two souls together - an unbreakable, irrevocable cord that weaves through the labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It is a bond that reveals itself in the most dire of circumstances, when the true nature of this tie is laid bare, be it born of good or evil. The emotions that simmer beneath its surface carry with them a heavy cost, one that is paid in full when the consequences of these feelings are confronted. It is in the depths of this bond that one can gaze into the eyes of a brother and behold one's own reflection, unencumbered by the perceptions of others. There, in the actions and the weight of those actions, lies the true characterization of a man.\n\nIn the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a forlorn journey through a landscape both lush and desolate. Their path is fraught with bitter disappointment and intense pride, culminating in a climactic scene where only one brother emerges alive. The theme is woven through the fabric of the narrative, its complexities revealed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective. This perspective serves as a window into the protagonist's inner world, a world shaped by his emotions and perceptions, both of which influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest endeavors together to their final, fateful excursion, he feels an underlying resentment towards Doodle. His was a desire for a brother who could share in his passions, to learn from him as he taught, to walk alongside him as he navigated the world. He yearned for a companion in the manner of \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" But life had other plans, and Doodle's frailty dealt a crushing blow to these aspirations. The young protagonist's dreams were dashed, leaving him with a sense of bitterness and despair.\n\nThis anger, however, was tempered by a glimmer of love, sparked by Doodle's innocent smile. This fleeting moment of tenderness revealed a depth to the protagonist's character, one that was previously shrouded in darkness. His trepidation, his consideration of infanticide, was but a facade, a testament to the complexity of human emotion. His love for Doodle, though masked by a façade of resentment, was a constant presence, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a spark of compassion.\n\nThis bond between brothers is a double-edged sword, its power both redemptive and destructive. It is a reminder that our actions have consequences, that our emotions are the guiding force behind our decisions. In the end, it is this bond that shapes us, that reveals our true character, and that demands that we confront the darkness within ourselves.",
            "The mind is a deep well of enigma, a labyrinth of shadowed corridors and dark recesses where the whispers of experience reside. As the ages passed and the world around us underwent its incremental metamorphosis, the analogies used to describe its workings also evolved, a slow and halting dance of comprehension. It was likened to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and most recently, a machine of hissing wires and glowing screens. Yet, these metaphors, like the shifting sands of the dunes, are but fleeting approximations, liable to lead us astray with their silken threads of deception.\n\nInformation, a slow and treacherous river, flows into the mind from the senses, its currents a jumble of tactile whispers, the susurrations of heat, the thrum of sound waves, and the caress of light. These raw stimuli are then transformed, alchemized by the mind's internal fires, in the crucible of bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine a traveler, traversing a forest, where the sounds of the underbrush – the rustling of leaves, the snapping of twigs – coalesce into the unmistakable presence of a wild creature, its shape and form emerging from the cacophony like a ghost from the shadows. Top-down processing, the attentive gaze of a presiding spirit, quickens our recognition, whispers the name of the creature, and assigns it its place in the grand tapestry of our experience.\n\nYet, not all information is created equal. The mind, a capricious monarch, filters out the extraneous, the trivial, the ephemeral, and reserves its attention for the essential, the vital, the meaningful. Like a sentinel, it stands guard over the gates of perception, admitting only what is deemed worthy, and rejecting the rest to the vast and uncaring expanse of the unknown. We are not aware of each blade of grass beneath our feet, nor the countless whispers of the wind, yet our minds remain vigilant, poised to respond to the subtlest hint of danger, the whispered name of a loved one in a crowded room.\n\nInformation must first be stored, and this is a task of intricate and mysterious provenance. There are multiple repositories of memory, each a dark and labyrinthine cave, hiding its secrets from the light. Sensory memory holds the fleeting impressions of the moment, the mirror-smooth surface of the water, the rough bark of the tree. Working memory, a fleeting whisper, holds the information for but a brief instant, a spark of insight that vanishes as quickly as it appears. Long-term memory, a slow and patient river, holds the accumulated wisdom of the ages, the secrets of the past, the mysteries of the yet-to-come.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the mind is a problem of ancient and abiding interest, a riddle that has puzzled scholars and sages for centuries. Some propose that it is a network of interconnected nodes, a vast and intricate web of concepts, each linked to its fellows by threads of association and relation. In this semantic tapestry, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on, an endless and labyrinthine path of meaning and connection.",
            "A specter of modernity looms large in the horizon, a dystopian vision born from the ashes of an all-consuming technological fervor and the cold, calculating tenets of capitalism. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a world where the communal over the individual has become the norm, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the paramount virtue, and the conditioning of the masses is carried out with precision by the omniscient World Controller. Beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, however, lies a web of ideological control, a subtle yet insidious dance of homogeny and reification that reduces the citizenry to mere pawns in a game of conformity.\n\nAs we delve into the world of Huxley's protagonist, we find the telltale signs of a capitalist machine at work, its gears turning, its cogs clicking into place with a calculated efficiency. The thesis of false consciousness comes to mind, a notion born from Marxist theory, where the common folk are kept in the dark about their true relations to the classes above and below, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence. The conditioning of the masses, facilitated by the World Controller's subtle hand, has created a society where the lower classes, relegated to their respective stations, are blissfully unaware of the manipulation that governs their existence. The upper echelons, meanwhile, are either complicit in this charade or resigned to their fate, their awareness of the system's machinations merely a distant echo of a long-forgotten truth.\n\nIn this sterile world, relationships are reduced to shallow interactions, a façade of connection that belies the true nature of human experience. Love, once a flame that burns bright, has been extinguished, replaced by the hollow tones of superficial affection. The characters, even those at the forefront of the narrative, are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, their thoughts and emotions stripped bare, leaving only the husk of a humanity that has been drained of its vitality. The interactions between them, a series of stilted exchanges, serve only to reinforce the notion that the rise of technology and capitalism has led to the erosion of free will and the stifling of human expression.\n\nAs we navigate the sterile landscape of Brave New World, we are left to ponder the consequences of a system that values complacency above all else. The societal classes, each resigned to their place in the hierarchy, are a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, their obedience a stark reminder of the proletariat's false consciousness. And so, we are left to wonder: in this world of calculated happiness and controlled dissent, is there room for anything more? Is there a glimmer of hope, a spark that might ignite the flame of resistance against the all-consuming machine of capitalism?\n\nIn the end, it is a question that echoes through the pages of Brave New World, a reminder that even in the most seemingly utopian of societies, the seeds of dissent and rebellion are sown, waiting to be nurtured by those who dare to challenge the status quo.",
            "Four and a half semesters at University Park. The trees lean in over the walkways, casting long shadows in the morning light. I've seen students trudge through the winter's grasp, their breath misting in the chill air. The East Halls dorms, where I first laid my head, stood sentinel at the farthest edge of campus, a bastion of isolation. To reach the Willard building, a hub of academic activity, the walk could take twenty-five minutes, the minutes ticking away like grains of sand in an hourglass. The weather, a constant companion, could slow the pace to a crawl.\n\nI spoke with a fellow student, an alumnus not much older than myself, and he spoke of the days when the East Halls dorms stood apart, surrounded by a vast expanse of vacant land. Now, that emptiness has given way to a sprawl of sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus expands, the distances between destinations lengthen, and the pathways narrow. In this labyrinth, the bicycle stands as a beacon of efficiency and freedom.\n\nBut the bike itself is mere potential, a tool waiting to be wielded. It is the student who must take the reins, who must ride the bike with purpose and intent. And the campus, too, must be designed with the bicyclist in mind, a network of roads and pathways that weave together like the threads of a tapestry.\n\nI recall a conversation with a friend, one who had rediscovered the joy of cycling after a hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his words laced with conviction. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" The benefits of cycling extend beyond the physical, a symbiotic relationship between body and machine. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a morning ride can propel you twenty-five miles or more, a testament to the bicycle's efficiency.\n\nAs an off-campus resident, I've found myself relying on my bike to navigate the terrain. The Thomas building, a hub of academic activity, is a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep. But with the bike, that journey is reduced to a mere five minutes, a testament to the power of human ingenuity. However, the road to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not always an easy one, a serpentine path through the urban landscape.\n\nThere are those who prefer the gentle stroll, the rhythmic cadence of footsteps on pavement. But for me, time is a luxury I can ill afford. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, a journey that would consume an extra thirty to forty minutes of my day, a time sink that would leave me drained. The cumulative effect would be staggering, a loss of two and a half hours each week, a sacrifice I'm not willing to make.\n\nIn this crucible of time and space, the bicycle stands as a symbol of liberation, a tool that can bridge the gaps between destinations, a bridge that can be built or broken, depending on the choices we make. As the campus continues to evolve, let us not forget the humble bicycle, a simple machine that can change the world, one pedal stroke at a time."
