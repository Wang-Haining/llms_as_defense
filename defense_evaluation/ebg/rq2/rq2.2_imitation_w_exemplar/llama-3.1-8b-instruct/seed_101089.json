            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I had always been drawn to the unforgiving aspects of the human experience, the way the darkness creeps into the corners of our lives like a cold wind. It was this morass of suffering that drove me towards the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to a career in social work. I aim to navigate the treacherous waters of human relationships, guiding those who have been ravaged by the cruelty of abuse and neglect, and offering a beacon of hope to families torn asunder.\n\nAs I embark on this journey, I am guided by a set of values that have been etched into my very being: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These principles are not merely abstract ideals, but a reflection of my own unshakeable convictions. I have always been moved by the desire to help others, to ease the burden of their torment, and to offer a listening ear to those who have been silenced.\n\nMy path to this profession has been long and winding, marked by moments of doubt and uncertainty. As I navigated the hallowed halls of high school and college, I witnessed the devastating effects of denial and the destructive nature of poor coping mechanisms. It was this stark reality that led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that has given me a deeper understanding of the human condition. But it was not until I encountered a young boy, a teenager who had been driven to the brink of despair by the cruelty of his parents, that I knew I had found my calling.\n\nThat summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to this boy, a soul as fragile as a leaf in the autumn wind. He was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. I saw in him a spark of resilience, a flame that flickered despite the attempts to extinguish it by those who were supposed to love and protect him. It was this encounter that galvanized me, that set me on a path towards social work.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of social justice. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we often strive for conformity, seeking to blend in with the crowd rather than stand out as a beacon of uniqueness. I reject this notion, embracing instead the beauty of individuality, of being a thread that stands out in a tapestry of sameness. Throughout my years in high school and college, I have fought against social injustice, a crusade that has taken many forms: from the bold statement of my hair, to the piercing of my ears, to my unwavering commitment to the causes of the GSBA. I will continue to fight for what I believe in, even in the face of adversity.\n\nAs I move forward on this journey, I am aware that the road ahead will be fraught with challenges, that the darkness will often seem overwhelming. But I am resolute, my commitment to social work a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. I will continue to navigate the shadows, to seek out those who have been lost, and to offer a hand of hope to those who have been broken. For it is in the darkness that we find the beauty of the human spirit, a resilience that can overcome even the most insurmountable obstacles.",
            "In the depths of a desolate landscape, where the shadows of sleep disorders cast their dark specter, lies the complex tapestry of insomnia. A disorder that shrouds the lives of many, its etiology a labyrinth of biological and sociocultural pathways. The biological model, a study of the innate and acquired aspects of sleep, weaves a narrative of genetic predispositions and physiological abnormalities. The neurons in the hypothalamus, like sentinels of the night, regulate the balance of wakefulness and slumber. The orexin neurons, messengers of the somnambulant realm, rely on the GABAB receptors to modulate the ebb and flow of consciousness. A study of mice, a microcosm of humanity, revealed that the activation of GABAA receptors induces a somnolent state, while their inhibition renders the animal calm and sleep-prone (Matsuki et al., 2009). The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for repose, increased sleep time, underscoring the notion that the genetic and environmental interplay governs the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor can disrupt the nocturnal vigil, leaving an individual vulnerable to the whims of an insomniac existence.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a tapestry of environmental relationships, threads together the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic determinants of sleep disorders. The canvas of demographics, a rich and varied hue, reveals the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia. A study of the inherited phenotype, a genetic blueprint, suggests that the receptor's regulation of sleep can be influenced by environmental factors, weaving a complex narrative of causality and consequence. The sociocultural implications of this study reveal that the absence or malfunction of the GABAB receptor can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the individual but also their relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.\n\nThe Primary sleep disorders, a category of insomnia, include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, each a distinct thread in the tapestry of sleep disturbances. Dyssonmias, characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder, a canvas of Axis I and Axis II disorders, involve sleep difficulties as a symptom of underlying conditions.\n\nThe review of insomnia, a somber and introspective journey, critiques the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a nuanced analysis that reveals the complexities of the biological and sociocultural models. The research on the GABAB receptor, a catalyst for sleep, highlights the genetic and environmental interplay that governs the regulation of consciousness. The sociocultural implications of this study underscore the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia, a reminder that the consequences of sleep disorders extend far beyond the realm of the individual, impacting relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human mind, a disorder wanders, unseen and unfelt, a Central Auditory Processing Disorder, its presence a whisper in the darkness. Like a cracked mirror, it distorts the reflection of sound, reflecting a reality that is not quite our own. The brain, that labyrinthine city, cannot collect the scattered shards of auditory information, cannot weave them into a coherent tapestry. The sounds that assail it, a cacophony of chaos, are lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. This is CAPD, a condition that mocks the notion of order, a disorder that defies diagnosis, a specter that haunts the halls of perception.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the 1950s, a faint cry in the wilderness of human understanding. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari kindled a flame of inquiry in 1954, their work a beacon in the darkness. The model of the brain's auditory processing, a map of the twisted paths and hidden caverns, began to take shape. Kimura's dichotic testing, a litany of sound and silence, revealed the hidden workings of the brain, a machinery of perception, creaking and groaning under the weight of its own complexity.\n\nBut what are the symptoms of this disorder, this twisted mirror that reflects a world askew? The person afflicted may stumble in the darkness, unable to localize the source of sound, like a traveler lost in a forest without a compass. They may struggle to differentiate between the gentle rustle of leaves and the harsh cry of a stranger. The sounds that assail them, a cacophony of chaos, may be lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. They may not be able to synthesize the clues, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, to make sense of the world. They may be unable to determine the sequence of events, like a traveler lost in a labyrinth, unable to find the exit.\n\nDiagnosis, a quest for the truth, a search for the hidden patterns, is a perilous journey. The patient must be screened, tested, and probed, like a traveler in a foreign land, searching for a hidden passage. The tools of the trade, a assortment of tests and questionnaires, may reveal the hidden truth, but like a map of a mountain range, the terrain is treacherous, and the path uncertain. There is no single test, no one tool, that can reveal the truth, like a shining light in the darkness. The disorder, a chameleon, shifts and changes, a will-o-the-wisp, leading the seeker on a wild goose chase.\n\nIn the end, it is the teacher, that steadfast guide, who must navigate the treacherous waters of the classroom, who must find a way to reach the student, to make sense of the sounds, to weave them into a coherent tapestry. The teacher, a weaver of words, a storyteller of sounds, must find a way to make the student see, to hear, to understand. It is a task of wonder, a quest for the impossible, a journey into the very heart of the human mind.",
            "In the dusty tomes of literature, a play stands out like a bleached bone in the desert: Twelfth Night. A work that exposes the nuanced dance of deception, where the cracks of a persona can shatter like the brittle earth beneath a man's boot. The cultivation of disguise, a tool wielded by the cunning, can serve to enthrall and conceal, but it is a fragile thing, liable to unravel at the slightest touch. The question lingers, a specter haunting the frayed edges of our understanding: to shed the disguise, or to cling to it, risking the loss of one's very self.\n\nIn the subterfuge of Viola's transformation, we find a searching question: what drives one to don the guise of another? Is it self-preservation, a flickering flame of hope in a world fraught with danger? Or is it something more profound, a hunger to supplant one's own identity with another's? Viola's desperation to escape the perils of a foreign land has her donning the garb of a man, but in doing so, she forges a chasm between herself and the women who might offer her solace. Her ruse is so convincing that it ensnares Olivia, who confuses her with the illusory Sebastian, and Orsino, whose passions are stirred by the very presence of Viola/Cesario.\n\nYet, as we peer into the crevices of this play, we find that deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting both ways. It can liberate, allowing the hidden to emerge from the shadows, as in the case of Olivia and Orsino, whose suppressed desires are laid bare by the guise of Viola. Or it can ensnare, trapping one in a labyrinth of self-delusion, as in the case of the characters who mistake appearance for reality.\n\nThe question lingers, a ghostly whisper in the darkness: what lies beneath the surface of Olivia's ardor for Cesario? Is it a genuine affection, or a shallow attraction born of societal expectations? Her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian seems to suggest the latter, a parody of the superficial judgments that plague her world. This is a world where appearance holds sway, where the eyes see only what lies on the surface, and the heart remains hidden.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night stands as a testament to the fraught nature of deception, a delicate balance between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships. It is a play that reminds us that our guises, though they may shield us from the world, are also a thin veil, ever-precarious and prone to tearing. As we navigate the complexities of identity and deception, we are forced to confront the question: what lies at the heart of our true selves, and what are we willing to sacrifice to preserve our masks?",
            "The shadows of colonialism stretched far and wide, their brutality seared into the annals of history like the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama, whose genocide in German South West Africa stands as a testament to the empire's unyielding grip on the colonies. And yet, like a labyrinth, the German colonial empire defied reduction to a single narrative, its policies and rulers as varied as the landscapes they sought to conquer. Educational provision, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony a different tapestry woven from the same dark loom.\n\nIn East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of Africans schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge, their minds awakened by the German colonial endeavor. The praise of contemporary authors bore witness to the successes of German education in Kamerun and other colonies, where the promise of enlightenment seemed within reach. But South West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark, unyielding contrast. Here, the task of educating the native was left to the mercy of missionary societies, their endeavors woefully underfunded and unsupported by the colonial government. And yet, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary schools with an iron fist. This double standard would have far-reaching consequences, leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of the African population.\n\nSouth West Africa remained a land of darkness, where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The divergent experience of this colony was the result of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, each thread intricately woven into the tapestry of colonial history. This paper seeks to unravel these factors, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to expand the discussion through the lens of new research.\n\nThe written record of education in the German colonial empire is vast and largely in German, a legacy of the colonial era. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, sought to describe the educational systems of the various colonies, their authors driven by a desire to catalog the empire's accomplishments. Later writings, penned in English, took a more comparative approach, highlighting the differences between the colonies and probing the intricacies of education in each. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands as a landmark work, its author's comparisons and analyses illuminating the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in the colony's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, though temperate in certain regions, was harsh and unforgiving, its vast deserts a testament to the unforgiving nature of the land. Yet, this harsh environment attracted a sizable European population, with nearly 15,000 whites calling the colony home by 1913. In contrast, the settler population of East Africa, the next largest, numbered a mere 5,336.",
            "In the unrelenting sprawl of popular music, a genre has risen like a behemoth from the ashes of sound, its darkness spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of time. Heavy Metal, a moniker born of fire and fury, has grown in complexity over the past four decades, a hydra-like entity that spawns sub-genres like so many hydra's heads, each one a serpent of sound that slices through the air with unyielding ferocity. Its early days, a maelstrom of noise and chaos, gave rise to a movement that would forever change the face of music, a movement that would revel in the darker corners of the human experience.\n\nLike a river that flows from its source to the sea, Heavy Metal has taken on the waters of other genres, incorporating their themes and motifs into its ever-evolving tapestry. But its essence remains unyielding, a stubborn refusal to be bound by the constraints of melody or harmony. It is a music of excess, of bombast, of sheer, unadulterated energy. And at its heart, a darkness that pulses like a living thing, a darkness that draws its power from the very depths of the human condition.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of melodic sweetness, once unleashed a torrent of sonic fury with \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that would become a benchmark for the Heavy Metal genre. Its frantic energy, its obsessive rhythms, its unrelenting drive – all these spoke to a generation's desire to break free from the constraints of conventional music, to unleash a maelstrom of sound that would shatter the stillness of the air. And in that moment, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would forever change the face of music.\n\nBut what is Heavy Metal, really? Is it a genre, a movement, a way of life? It is all these things, and more. It is a reflection of our deepest fears, our darkest desires. It is a manifestation of our primal selves, our animalistic urges, our most basic needs. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our baser instincts.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was fueled by the excesses of the 1970s, a decade of psychedelic experimentation and reckless abandon. But it was also a response to the darkness that lay just beneath the surface of our society, a darkness that would eventually boil over into the chaos of the 1980s. And in the aftermath, Heavy Metal emerged, a phoenix from the ashes, its wings spread wide, its eyes blazing with a fierce, unyielding intensity.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal is a hydra-like entity, its many heads snapping and twisting, each one a different manifestation of its unyielding energy. It is a genre, a movement, a way of life. It is a reflection of our darkest selves, our most primal urges. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our basest instincts.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of his mind, there arose a figure, a painter who toiled in obscurity, bound by the chains of his own unbridled ambition. Henri Rousseau, a name whispered in reverence among the art world's elite, fought a solitary battle, a war of wills between the siren song of conformity and the howling wind of creative freedom. His canvas, The Dream, a 1910 masterpiece, stood as a testament to this inner turmoil, a harbinger of the dreams and desires that haunted his every waking moment.\n\nBut who was this man, this Rousseau, and what drove him to such fervent devotion to his craft? Born in the forgotten town of Laval, France, on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, his life was a tapestry woven from the threads of hardship and heartache. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, had known prosperity, but it was a fleeting respite from the drudgery that lay at the heart of their existence. As a young man, Rousseau toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, his art a mere indulgence, a secret kept hidden from the world. Yet, it was in this very darkness that he found solace, a refuge from the crushing weight of his grief, for his first wife, Clémence, had left him, taking with her eight infant children, leaving him with only one, a daughter, Julia.\n\nThe ache within him, a wound that would never fully heal, drove him to take up the brush, to lose himself in the colors and textures of his art. He was a folk painter, a man of the people, and his art reflected this, a testament to the hopes and dreams of the common man. But, in a world where art was a domain of the elite, where the likes of Matisse and his contemporaries reigned supreme, Rousseau's struggle was all the more poignant. For him, recognition was not just a want, but a necessity, a validation of his very existence. And so, he painted, driven by a hunger for acceptance, a desire to be seen, to be heard.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Matisse and Rousseau were not just competitors, but kindred spirits, bound by their passion for art, yet driven by different motivations. Matisse, a master of subtlety, feared the triteness of his craft, while Rousseau, a painter of unbridled enthusiasm, sought to create works so conventional, so mediocre, that he would be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. The Dream, a painting born of this inner conflict, stands as a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, a reflection of the dreams and desires that shaped his life, a reminder that even in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of hope, a light that guides us towards our own unique path.",
            "In the desolate vastness of the human experience, there exists a whispered understanding that ties the frayed threads of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. It is a notion that echoes through the ages, a litany of great thinkers who have attempted to grasp the essence of this connection. John Keats, in his Ode on a Grecian Urn, poignantly encapsulates the symbiosis: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The dichotomy lies not in the learned or the experienced, but in the unseen, the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that defies the confines of language and education.\n\nWe are drawn to ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, with an instinctual reverence, a primal recognition that transcends the realm of the explainable. Both seek to capture the ephemeral, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral. Our attempts at criticism and analysis, however, often fall short, like a faint echo in the void. When we discuss the merits of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may invoke concepts like foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these words falter to convey the very heart of its beauty. When asked what draws us to a particular work of art or literature, we often find ourselves reduced to a hollow phrase, a \"there's just something about it,\" a confession of the inexplicable.\n\nThis transcendental quality, this something that cannot be said, is the shared thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics into a single tapestry. Flannery O'Connor astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, art and morality exist on a plane where description falters, where words and concepts fail to capture the essence. As Wittgenstein remarks, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence that connects ethics and aesthetics, a shared vulnerability to the human experience.\n\nIn the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced. We experience literature, like morality, on a noumenal level, a realm that defies explanation and rationalization. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" The boundaries between art and morality blur, and in this convergence, we find the very essence of our humanity.\n\nIn this desolate, post-apocalyptic world, where the wind howls through the ruins, we cling to the fragments of our collective understanding, the whispered truths that bind us together. Ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, these seeming dichotomies merge into a single, unyielding whole, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of time, a nation emerged, forged from the crucible of disparate elements. Germany, a land of contrasts, born from the shadows of the Alps, where the Bavarian charm of München gives way to the rugged beauty of the Baltic coast in Kiel. The Rhine's storied waters flow through Köln, a city of ancient stones and modernity, to the storied Saxon city of Dresden, where the Elbe River whispers secrets of a bygone era. This cultural tapestry, woven from the threads of various tribes and sources, is a testament to the nation's complexity.\n\nGermania, the ancestral land of the Germans, shrouded in mystery, gave birth to a people whose very name is a subject of scholarly debate. The etymology of \"German\" is a labyrinthine path, traversing the annals of history. Tacitus, a Roman historian, posited that the name originated from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, before crossing the Rhine, had been known as Germans. Their battles against the Gauls, as chronicled by Tacitus, left an indelible mark on the pages of history.\n\nThe Roman conqueror Julius Caesar, in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the vanquished Gauls. This word, taken from the Gauls themselves, speaks to the complex nature of cultural exchange and the fluidity of identity. In his writings, Caesar noted the Germans' unwavering ferocity, waging war with the Gauls in almost daily battles. The origins of the name \"German,\" however, remain shrouded in uncertainty, with some positing a connection to the Gaulish language, while others point to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the Germans' reputation for being a loud and boisterous people.\n\nIn his treatise, De Origine et situ Germanorum, Tacitus penned a vivid portrait of the German people, describing them as an aboriginal nation, unblemished by the influx of foreign blood or cultural influence. The Germans, he wrote, were a people of the sea, arriving on the shores of their ancestral land via ships, not land, and defying the allure of more hospitable climes. The Romans, for their part, contented themselves with conquests and trade, their gaze fixed on the riches of Germania, rather than the land itself.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to make their presence felt in the first century, they existed on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills, yet forever bound to their own identity. In this liminal space, they forged a nation, tempered by the crucible of history, and shaped by the whispers of a distant past.",
            "The void before me spread out like a bleached canvas, drained of color and vibrancy. My mind wandered listlessly, tracing the contours of the scene before me with a detachment that bordered on numbness. Each thought that arose was a fleeting specter, vanishing as swiftly as it appeared, leaving no residue or echo. My consciousness functioned with a mechanical efficiency, processing the visual data with a precision that belied any personal engagement. It was as if I had been severed from the very fabric of thought, left to drift on a sea of sensory input.\n\nIn a distant corner of my mind, a memory stirred – a conversation with an artist, a sage piece of advice that had long since been filed away. He spoke of a technique, a square frame that could tame the chaos of a scene, reducing it to a manageable, comprehensible whole. I recalled the book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" and the exercises that promised to unlock the secrets of artistic vision. But on this occasion, I was too enthralled, too awestruck by the tableau before me to summon the discipline to impose that frame. The world was too vast, too overwhelming, and I stood frozen, a captive of my own wonder.\n\nIn the realm of art, masters had their own predilections – Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's rainbow-hued masterpieces. If I aspired to join their ranks, to be counted among the makers of beauty and meaning, then perhaps this was my starting point – the genesis of my own artistic vision, my own Work in Brown. My hand twitched, eager to grasp the tool of my craft, but it was not the pencil that would shape my destiny, nor the paintbrush that would bring my vision to life. It was something far more mundane, far more prosaic – a handle, a lever, a tool for the task at hand.\n\nMy fingers closed around it, my muscles tensed, and my hand moved with a jerky, spasmodic motion, as if driven by a will of its own. The offending mass refused to yield, stuck fast like a reluctant mollusk on the bowl's porcelain floor. The mop, a limp and lifeless thing, dangled in my hand, while my tie chafed against my throat, a constant reminder of the constraints that bound me to this thankless task. I stood, frozen, my gaze fixed on the putrid mass before me, as the minutes ticked away, each one a small, incremental step towards my own creative desolation.\n\nThe flush, a soothing balm, seemed to wash away my doubts, and I reached for the sheet, my hand extending, slow and deliberate, like a supplicant seeking absolution. The toilet paper, a meager solace, offered little comfort as I wrapped my fingers around it, transforming it into a makeshift mitten. And then, with a slow, deliberate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a ritualistic act, a concession to the sordid task that lay before me.",
            "In a world shrouded in darkness, a plague ravages the nation's young drivers, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake.  It is a problem as old as the road itself, born of inexperience and a reckless abandon that can only be described as a form of self-immolation.  The National Institutes of Health whisper a truth too terrible to ignore: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to handle the unforgiving dangers of the open road.\n\nIt is not merely a question of numbers, but of essence.  The statistics paint a picture of a generation forsaken to the whims of fate, their inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the highway.  Speed, recklessness, and the cruel fate of vehicle rollover – all are the hallmarks of a demographic that refuses to be held accountable for its actions.\n\nAnd yet, this is not a problem of individual failing, but of a collective one.  For when teens ride with their peers, the danger multiplies, a deadly calculus that defies all reason.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has seen the correlation, a grim reminder of the perils that await those who drive with the devil's own children by their side.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stem the tide, states have implemented provisional licenses, limiting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers.  But these measures, though well-intentioned, are nothing more than a stopgap, a palliative that treats the symptoms rather than the disease.  The root of the problem lies deeper, a fundamental issue that speaks to the very essence of adolescence itself.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman has dared to speak the unspoken truth: even the age of 18 is too young for the unforgiving demands of driving.  His research reveals a disturbing desire among the young to court danger for its own sake, a thrall to the sensation that is as old as time itself.  It is a siren's call, beckoning the unwary to the rocks of destruction.\n\nLegislation is the only solution, a straightforward answer to a problem that has been allowed to simmer for far too long.  Schools must continue to teach the fundamentals of driving, but no child under the age of 18 should be allowed to take the wheel.  A provisional permit may still be granted, but with stricter conditions, and a greater emphasis on practical training.  The number of hours required should be standardized, a nationwide measure to ensure that all teens are held to the same standards.\n\nIt is not a novel idea, but a necessary one.  For the sake of the nation's young, we must act, before the death toll reaches catastrophic proportions.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's babies will be hitting the road, and the consequences will be dire.  We owe it to ourselves, to our children, and to the future to take action.  Anything less would be a betrayal of our duty to protect the innocent.",
            "In the musty vaults of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon the Edison films of old. It was a collection of trick films, fourteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. I was drawn to the obscure and the forgotten, the illusions woven within these early reels. My study of these films was a dance with the shadows, a probing of the poetics that governed their creation. And among them, I discovered the evolutionary outliers, the few that dared to break free from the shackles of convention.\n\nThe trick films of the era, it seemed, were bound by the strictures of their time. They were set-bound, confined to the proscenium of a stage, their cameras rooted to a single position. No movement, only stasis. Long shots and medium shots, a static frame that held the world in place. The one shot, one film methodology, an unyielding rule that governed the narrative. But there were whispers of dissent, hints of a new language emerging in the early days of the century.\n\nI noticed that the trick films, despite their artificiality, shared a common trait – their confinement within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera stood steadfast, a sentinel guarding the threshold, never straying to follow the figures or objects within the frame. This composition, born of the theatre and the vaudeville stage, imposed a limitation on the actors' movement, restricting them to a lateral dance, a perpetual side-to-side shuffle. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained still, a faithful witness to the spectacle.\n\nThe proscenium's grip on the films was firm, a hand that guided the gaze of the viewer. Long shots and medium shots dominated the landscape, with close-ups a rare and forbidden fruit. The audience, like the actors, was bound to the middle ground, denied the intimacy of a piercing glance. The theatre's traditions, born of a time when the entire performance was laid bare upon the stage, dictated the visual vocabulary of the trick films.\n\nThe one-shot, one-film rule cast a long shadow over the narrative, limiting the trick films to a few fleeting moments, each a tantalizing glimpse of the impossible. Most were confined to the realm of vaudeville, a brief, shining moment of magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand. Yet, within this strictures, the filmmakers wove a subtle magic, a dance of illusion and deception. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from the early days, revealed itself to be a masterclass in misdirection, a single shot crafted from multiple pieces, each a thread in the tapestry of illusion.\n\nI stood there, surrounded by the ghosts of the past, the Edison films a testament to the early days of cinema. The trick films, with their stilted movements and bound composition, spoke of a time when the art was still finding its voice, its language. And I, a wanderer in the Library of Congress, felt the whispers of that language, the echoes of a world in the making.",
            "In the inclement land of the nascent republic, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a beacon of fervent conviction. His agricultural pursuits and fleeting foray into politics forged a man unyielding in his devotion to the sacred principles of personal freedom and the curbing of government overreach. His agrarian ethos, the bedrock upon which his opinions were founded, guided his discourse on the very fabric of sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary. He saw the fledgling United States as a tabula rasa, untainted by the legacy of colonial rule, a rare opportunity to craft a system of self-governance that would reflect the inherent duality of human nature.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, intertwined and interdependent, each one a vital thread in the tapestry of human existence. He posited that the denial of one right would unravel the entire fabric, leaving the remaining threads tattered and diminished. These rights, he fervently believed, must remain beyond the grasp of the government's grasping hand. The state of nature, he argued, was a realm where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, a dystopian world that civilized society must strive to overcome.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and the evil that resided within humanity. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that government, like its citizens, was a reflection of human virtues and vices. He posited that good principles would safeguard private property, foster agriculture, and temper the excesses of capitalism, while a government founded upon these principles would operate with equity, even in the face of administrations driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was an innate human trait, but one that became pernicious when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the many for the benefit of the few.\n\nIn line with his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, a minimalist Federal government with powers explicitly stated and no more. He recognized the dangers of a vast and expensive Federal authority, prone to despotism, but also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter of the United States, a document that encapsulated the essence of a nation comprising sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "The decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project was a stark precipice, a chasm between the fervor of initiation and the slumber of indifference.  The change in seasons, the New England campus shrouded in winter's chill, may have contributed to the ebbing tide of participation, as the familiar cadence of bicycle and foot traffic gave way to the stillness of frozen earth.  The end of the fall semester brought its own set of distractions - the din of final exams, the whirlwind of grade processing - and the commuter log, a small but vital thread in the tapestry of the project, may have been lost in the tumult.  The holiday season, a time of festive abandon, brought a lull in activity, a pause in the regular rhythms of the semester, and the promise of a month-long respite from the demands of academia.  Yet, it was not until the spring semester resumed, like a phoenix from the ashes, that the project began to stir once more.\n\nBut the decline persisted, a stubborn and unyielding force, and it seemed as though the project itself was a flame flickering in the wind, struggling to stay alight.  The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate bid to rekindle the spark, did bring a brief surge in log submissions, a fleeting respite from the winter's chill, but it was not enough to sustain the momentum, and the numbers continued to dwindle.  It was as though the project was a traveler, caught in the midst of a long and dusty road, where the horizon seemed to stretch out before him like an endless expanse of gray.\n\nAnd so, we were left to ponder the nature of participation, to probe the depths of human psychology, and to consider the allure of the automobile, that great and seductive siren of modern life.  For in the end, it is the freedom, the independence, and the flexibility of the car that prove so alluring, a siren's call that is deeply ingrained in our culture.  The prizes we offered, tokens of our appreciation and our desire to encourage alternative modes of commuting, may have been insufficient, mere trinkets in the grand tapestry of human desire.  But what if we had offered something more, something greater, a shining jewel on the horizon of possibility?  Would it have been enough to stir the hearts of our participants, to rouse them from their slumber and to rekindle the flame of engagement?\n\nWe may never know, but it is a question that haunts us still, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of renewal, of rebirth, and of a new beginning.  And so, we press on, driven by the faint hope that one day, we may find the key to unlocking the secrets of human participation, and that our project may emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In a realm where the instruments of commerce reign supreme, a breed of security emerged, a creature born of innovation and flexibility. The exchange traded fund, or ETF, a chameleon of sorts, donned the guise of a stock, yet possessed the diversification of its index fund brethren. It strode across the exchanges, a flexible and versatile entity, allowing the freedom to buy on margin, sell short, and acquire a single share with each transaction. Though its allure was great, a shadowy presence lurked in the form of expense ratios, lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a specter of commissions haunted each trade. The ETF's panoply of available funds was a veritable tapestry, woven from the threads of diversity.\n\nYet, like all things, the ETF held its pitfalls. A cost to be reckoned with, a commission that accompanied each transaction, like a specter haunting the steps of the prudent investor. It was a prudent exercise, then, for the discerning investor to evaluate the benefits touted by the ETF, to unravel the threads of diversification, and to gauge their extent. The ETF IHF, a creature of fascination, would be our quarry, its top 10 holdings to be scrutinized, compared against the top 10 holdings that comprised the ETF, to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF could rival those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. Would the ETF's promise of diversification hold true, or would there exist a configuration of the same stocks, a hidden pattern, that would yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nIn our pursuit of understanding, we have chosen to concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which accounted for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The numbers below reveal the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF IHF as a whole, we employed a method of normalization, assigning a value of 100% to the total assets, and then calculating the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it becomes apparent that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. At first glance, it seemed that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might provide a higher return with a lower Beta. Yet, the question remained: were these two portfolios statistically different?\n\nTo answer this, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results would reveal whether the differences between the two portfolios were significant, or mere whispers of chance.",
            "In the hollowed halls of literature, where the shadows dance with the whispers of the past, there exists a place of eerie silence, a Dream-Land forged by the masterful hand of Edgar Allan Poe. It is a realm where the boundaries of reality are blurred, where the living and the dead converge, and where the darkness reigns supreme. Here, in this forsaken land, Poe's words bleed into the poetry of another, a Thulé born from the imagination of Goethe, a siren's call to the unknown.\n\nThe echoes of Thulé resound through Poe's \"Dream-Land\", a poem that weaves a tapestry of sorrow, loss, and the eternal longing for a world that has passed. The term \"Thulé\" itself, like a phantom, haunts the lines of the poem, a whispered secret from the depths of the past. Virgil's ancient voice is said to have first uttered this enigmatic word, but it is in Goethe's \"Faust\" that we find its true resonance.\n\nIn the poetic drama of \"Faust\", a tale of love, loss, and damnation, Goethe's King of Thulé stands as a haunting figure, a monarch consumed by grief and despair. His story is one of a king who, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the darkness, his heart heavy with the weight of memories. This is a king who, like the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", is lost in a world devoid of color, a world shrouded in the shadows of the unknown.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, a testament to Poe's mastery of the poetic art. The former is a poem of sorrow, a dirge for a lost love, while the latter is a lament for the very fabric of reality itself. Both are companion pieces, each speaking to the other in a language that is both familiar and yet, utterly alien.\n\nPoe's debt to Goethe is evident in his use of the term Thulé, a nod to the German author's influence on his work. The echoes of Goethe's \"Faust\" can be heard in the dark, haunting landscapes of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker wanders, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of the past. This is a world without color, a world where the light of hope has faded, leaving only the cold, dark shadows of despair.\n\nIn the vast expanse of literary history, Goethe stands as a towering figure, a master of the poetic art. Poe, in his turn, was drawn to the vortex of Goethe's imagination, a siren's call that beckoned him to explore the depths of the human experience. The connection between the two authors is a testament to the power of literature to transcend time and space, to speak to the universal human condition.\n\nIn the words of Poe himself, we find a nod to the enduring legacy of Goethe, a legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of our time. For in the world of literature, there are few greater than the debt we owe to those who have come before us, who have walked the paths of the past, and who have left behind a trail of words that continue to guide us on our own journey through the shadows of the unknown.",
            "Under the cold light of California's laws, a customer who falls prey to an applesauce spill in a grocery store's hallowed halls, yet succeeds in extracting punitive damages from the establishment, might find solace in the knowledge that the store's manager had flouted the warning signs of impending doom. The store's manager, Paul Martin, had been twice informed of the spill's presence – once by Rich Wayne, an employee whose words fell on deaf ears, and again by Mary J. Haddigan, another employee whose pleas for action were similarly ignored. Martin, ensconced in the comfort of his dinner, had chosen to turn a blind eye to the danger that lurked beneath his feet. This deliberate disregard for the well-being of his customers would prove to be a fatal error, one that would leave Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, with a claim for punitive damages that would not be easily dismissed.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a stark picture of negligence and malice. Five slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months preceding Palmer's accident, yet Martin failed to take any meaningful action to address the issue. His cavalier attitude towards customer safety, exemplified by his flippant dismissal of customer complaints, would ultimately prove to be his downfall. The law is clear: in California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Martin's actions, far from being innocent oversights, demonstrate a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of his customers.\n\nThe California courts have long recognized that malice can be inferred when a defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). In this case, Martin's actions demonstrate a callous disregard for the safety of his customers, and a willful failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The question now before the court is whether this conduct rises to the level of despicable, and whether Martin's actions were committed with the requisite level of malice to warrant an award of punitive damages.",
            "Four years past I wrestled with the weight of Islam in a course at CBC.  A contentious subject of discussion was whether the faith itself was a harbinger of hostility.  I found that the question burned brighter with the passage of time, fueled by the embers of 9/11.  As the media's narrative shifted, a yawning chasm opened between the portrayal of Islam as a monolith of terror and its increasingly saccharine depiction in the American landscape.  It seemed inconceivable that just two decades prior, a presidential candidate with a Muslim family background would have been deemed unthinkable.  The concept of Barack Obama, a man whose name became synonymous with hope, would have been anathema in that dark time.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet holds a certain fascination for me, a narrative that seems to defy the historical record.  From what I had previously understood, Muhammad was a figure who compelled conversions through conquest and coercion.  Yet, the biography portrays a man of unassuming nature, a martyr whose humility and compassion drew followers to his cause.  As I delved deeper, I found the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad to be striking.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that rivaled the wonders of the New Testament, seemed designed to underscore Muhammad's character as a humble prophet, unencumbered by the need for proof or validation.\n\nBut this narrative struck me as a deliberate attempt to subvert the truth, to supplant the life and teachings of Jesus with a watered-down, sanitized version of Muhammad's story.  It was as if the writers sought to pilfer the essence of Christ's message and rebrand it as their own, a travesty that diminished the very fabric of the faith.  Furthermore, the reliance on third-hand accounts and hearsay only served to erode the credibility of the narrative, casting a veil of doubt over the entire enterprise.\n\nWhat unsettled me most, however, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  History, however, paints a different picture, one of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power.  I couldn't help but wonder if the true nature of Muhammad's rise to power was known to the Muslim faithful, or if they were complicit in the myth-making that had been spun around his legacy.",
            "The shadows of the Son of God were cast early upon the soul of Christianity, a faint outline of a figure whose teachings were lost in the labyrinthine corridors of time. As the years crept forward like a thief in the night, the true essence of the faith was shrouded in the mists of doctrine and dogma. The spinning of the theological clock, a maddening whirl of dogmatic fires, left the flame of the original message to flicker and die in the cold darkness of forgotten truths. \n\nYet, like the first faint light of dawn, a glimmer of awareness began to stir in the hearts of men. The orthodox, a bastion of tradition, stood rigid and unyielding, their grip on the past unyielding as the unyielding rock of a tormented sea. But the tide of progress, an unstoppable force, surged forward, gathering momentum as it rolled, an energized tsunami that threatened to sweep away the cobwebs of centuries. The voices of dissent, a whispered litany, grew louder, a cacophony of reason and curiosity that pierced the darkness like a shaft of sunlight.\n\nAnd so, the great reversal began, a movement of the heart, a yearning to reclaim the lost, to rediscover the fire that had once burned so brightly. It was a process of unwinding, a stripping away of the accretions that had accumulated over the centuries, a peeling back of the layers of dogma to reveal the unadorned truth. It would be a journey of centuries, a slow and painful process, but one that would ultimately lead to a return to the source, a reclamation of the original intent of the faith.\n\nAs the great reversion gathered pace, the landscape of Christianity was transformed. The diversity of interpretation, a chaotic tapestry of conflicting views, began to weave itself into a single, cohesive thread. The differences that had once seemed insurmountable, the divisions that had rent the fabric of the faith, began to fade away, until, like a great river finding its source, the waters of the soul were clarified, their essence distilled to its purest form.\n\nThis was not a return to the past, but a rediscovery of the future, a reclaiming of the fire that had been lost. It was a journey back to the source, a return to the wellspring of the faith, where the waters of the soul were clear and unadulterated. And when the great reversion was complete, the church, that great institution, would stand strong, a beacon of guidance, a leader on the path to enlightenment.\n\nBut what had occurred over the centuries since the lifetime of Jesus? The seeds of Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity, had been sown in the fertile soil of the Hebrew scriptures. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, had been the bedrock of the faith. Yet, the Jewish population had been rent asunder by division, a fractured community of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk, each with their own unique perspective on the faith.",
            "The Jungle, a tale of a world consumed by its own baser impulses, reveals to us the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. Like a diseased organism, it festers with greed and self-interest, its every fibre straining towards self-preservation above all else. The plutocrats, those masters of the great factories, care not for the well-being of their workers, nor for the world around them, as long as their coffers swell and their power grows. Theirs is a world of smoke and ash, where the great chimneys belch forth their noxious fumes, and the once-pristine waters run thick with the effluent of their neglect.\n\nAs we are drawn into the depths of Packingtown, we find a place where humanity has been reduced to nothing more than a commodity. The workers, toiling in the factories, are nothing more than beasts of burden, their lives reduced to a mere means to an end. The owners and managers, their hearts black as the coal they burn, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor for the suffering they inflict. They are driven by a singular purpose: to accumulate wealth and power, no matter the cost. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This is a world without mercy, a world where the strong prey upon the weak.\n\nAnd yet, it is not just the owners and managers who are to blame. The system itself is corrupt, a cancer that infects every aspect of life. The workers, desperate to survive, are forced to endure conditions that would be unimaginable to us today. They toil for long hours, for pitiful wages, and are cast aside like so much trash when they are no longer useful. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for redress, often prove to be little more than a mockery, preying upon the very people they claim to represent. Thus, we are left with a population that is little more than a mere shadow of humanity, a population that is as helpless as a slave.\n\nIn this bleak world, immorality reigns supreme. The workers, conditioned to survive in a system that offers them no quarter, are left to their own devices. They are forced to eke out a meager existence, dependent on the whims of their oppressors. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a grim testament to the darkest aspects of human nature, and a reminder that, even in the most desperate of times, there is no escape from the abyss that lies at the heart of our own nature.",
            "Many authors employ varied techniques to elicit a particular sentiment or disposition in their readers, some more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of this art, as exemplified in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs disparate adjectives with nouns to conjure a certain ambiance around a subject, imbuing them with a significance that is at once palpable and intangible. Another technique he employs is to assign meaning to symbols, only to later utilize them for a similar purpose. This method is particularly evident in his use of colors, specifically the dichotomy of white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a semantic landscape for these colors, only to utilize them as a harbinger for a particular feeling or reminder around a subject of importance.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of white/gray is particularly noteworthy, as he imbues these colors with a sense of uniformity, with white being synonymous with refinement and elegance, and gray with the patina of age and decay. Initially, he establishes this dichotomy by peppering the novel with instances of both colors, often in tandem. Daisy and Jordan are incessantly clad in white, a ubiquitous presence that extends to the rest of the novel's characters, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's soiree to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time this uniformity is interrupted is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). This juxtaposition serves to further reinforce the notion that white and gray are inextricably linked.\n\nFitzgerald also extends this semantic reach by applying these colors to everyday, mundane objects, thereby underscoring their ubiquity. As Nick traverses the city, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable are rendered as \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity that Fitzgerald seeks to convey. Even common individuals and places are frequently described in terms of these colors: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), while the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving thus established a semantic foundation for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is first evident in Daisy's characterization. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), thereby reducing her to a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further exemplified in her subsequent appearances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "A desolate fertility lay in wait in San Diego County, its soil yearning to be tilled by the patient hands of a farmer. The land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, stood as a testament to the unforgiving beauty of nature. Adjoining the town of Potrero, in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, this land held secrets of the past, its soil scarred by the hands of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who had once called this place home. The weight of this history hung heavy, like the stillness of the chaparral's February mornings.\n\nAs the seasons unfolded, a verdant tapestry of life would bloom: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers would burst forth, their colors and scents a testament to the land's untapped potential. A niche market beckoned, and the prospect of organic community supported agriculture lured many to the area, their waiting lists a testament to the hunger for this wholesome, earthy beauty. The allure of organic eggs and milk, too, drew in the faithful, their taste buds awakened by the promise of untainted purity.\n\nYet, the path to this bounty was fraught with challenges, the delicate balance between profit and preservation a tightrope to walk. The organic farm, a beacon of sustainability, stood as a shining example of the difficulties faced by those who sought to coax life from this unforgiving earth. Intensive labor and management were required, as the farmer's hands wrestled with pests, weeds, and the capricious whims of the soil. Losses were inevitable, and the small-scale operation's lack of efficiency stood in stark contrast to the grandeur of large-scale conventional farming.\n\nIn this crucible, the landowner found themselves torn between the siren song of profit and the seraphic whispers of the land itself. The property, once the domain of Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, now stood as a testament to the fragile dance between humanity and the natural world. The Cleveland National Forest, a sentinel to the north, watched over this fragile balance, its ancient wisdom a reminder of the delicate harmony that existed between the creatures of this land and the land itself.\n\nIn this uncertain landscape, the landowner found themselves searching for a guiding light, a beacon to illuminate the path ahead. Government programs, a lifeline in these uncertain times, offered a glimmer of hope, a means to mitigate the costs and preserve the beauty of this land. But the choices were many, and the road ahead, treacherous. The land, a patient teacher, waited for the farmer's hands to guide it, to coax forth the beauty that lay hidden beneath the surface. The future, a tapestry of promise and peril, beckoned, and the landowner stood at the crossroads, poised to make a choice that would shape the destiny of this 160-acre parcel, and the creatures that called it home.",
            "In the vast expanse of human interaction, cultural nuances hold sway like wisps of smoke that cling to the landscape. Culture, a tapestry woven from the threads of what we are not, as much as what we are, defies a singular definition. It is a labyrinthine entity, its contours shifting like the sands of time. Reducing an entire culture to a single trait - like assigning the label \"stubborn\" to all Russians or \"accommodating\" to all Japanese - is an exercise in futility, a crude approximation of the intricate patterns that underlie the human experience.\n\nAs one navigates the uncharted waters of foreign culture, the tendency to draw comparisons to one's own is a pitfall waiting to befall. The negotiator, seeking to understand the currents of a culture, must delve into its depths, tracing the contours of its history, its prejudices, and its values. It is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its inherent complexities and working within its bounds, especially when the stakes are high, and the bargaining position is precarious.\n\nCulture's reach extends far beyond the borders of nations; it permeates the very fabric of organizations, giving rise to corporate cultures that are as varied as the individuals within them. A company's values, evident in its dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices, can be as mercurial as the wind, shifting from one office to the next, from one region to the next. The American corporate landscape, with its diverse array of company cultures, is a testament to the fluidity of cultural expression.\n\nBut it is the values that underlie a culture that hold the key to understanding its very essence. Values, the bedrock of a culture, dictate the motivations, the priorities, and the very manner in which individuals interact with one another. In a culture where saving face or communal harmony is paramount, the negotiator must tread carefully, lest they inadvertently tread on sensitive ground. Conversely, in a culture where a hard-driven bargain is the hallmark, the negotiator must be prepared to adapt, lest they be left behind in the dust.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural differences, the negotiator must be willing to listen, to learn, and to adapt. By taking the time to understand the opponent on a personal level, they can tailor their approach, like a skilled navigator charting a course through uncharted waters. It is a delicate dance, one that requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of human culture, and a willingness to navigate the complexities that lie beneath the surface.",
            "It was said in the hollow of a man's chest, \"There is no God.\" A phrase oft repeated, a mantra of the forsaken and the lost. It originated in the pages of the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14, and was later taken up by St. Anselm as a cornerstone of his argument for the existence of the divine. Thomas Aquinas followed suit, his own reasoning a tapestry woven from threads of logic and reason. But what of these two proponents of the divine? Which of their arguments holds sway? To approach this question, we must first assume that both men speak of the same God - the God of the Bible, with all its attendant trappings and characteristics. To do otherwise would be to muddy the waters, to turn a straightforward comparison into a muddled morass.\n\nAnd so we begin with the assumption that both men speak of this God, and that their arguments are in defense of a singular, biblical concept. It is with this understanding that we examine the reasoning of St. Anselm. His argument hinges on the notion that the existence of God is inextricably tied to our own understanding of the divine. God, he posits, is that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. We need not look beyond the confines of our own souls to find proof of God's existence. This, of course, is a concept deeply rooted in the idea of faith - that which we cannot see, yet know to be true nonetheless. It is a notion that speaks to the very heart of the human condition.\n\nBut St. Thomas Aquinas takes a different tack. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, a notion that speaks to the rational, logical mind. This is an argument that would serve the evangelist well, for it would allow the spreading of the Gospel without the need for blind faith. And so Aquinas presents five logical arguments in favor of God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each, he posits, speaks to the necessity of God's existence. If a puzzle were incomplete, we could deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece through logic alone, without ever having seen it.\n\nIn the end, both men present valid arguments, yet neither fully captures the complexity of the human experience. Their arguments, while instructive, fail to account for the messy, multifaceted nature of human understanding. We are, after all, creatures of both reason and emotion, of logic and faith. We are torn between the desire for empirical evidence and the whispered promises of the soul. And so, we are left to navigate the twilight realm between the two, where truth and faith entwine like the branches of a withered tree.",
            "In the dim recesses of ancient time, a prince would stir, destined to be known as the Buddha. His life would unfold like a river, its waters dark and unfathomable, until he cast off the tethers of the world and beheld the radiant truth. His teachings would spread like a wildfire, igniting the flame of Buddhism, a fire that would burn for millennia. Yet, like the shifting sands of a desert, its form would change, its essence succumbing to the capricious winds of time. The Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a bastion of orthodoxy, would hold fast to its traditions, even as the Buddha's teachings had never spoken of such festivities as the annual water-cutting ceremony. And so, the differences would accumulate, like the delicate layers of a pearl, from the mundane customs to the very core of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, would be forced to adapt, their doctrines evolving like the silken threads of a spider's web.\n\nIn this tapestry of change, two threads would weave together – the internal and the external. Internal forces would arise from within the community, while external forces would come from without, their intentions either hostile or benign. The distinction would be crucial, for the fate of the Buddhist community hung in the balance.\n\nTo navigate this complex landscape, one must first understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core lies the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a luminous entity, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the sacred teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka reveals the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Anatta, the negation of the self, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, would be the bedrock upon which the edifice of enlightenment was built. Only by grasping these concepts could one shatter the cycle of Sansara, the wheel of birth and death, and free themselves from the fetters of lobha, dosa, and moha.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, would outline the rules for laymen and monks alike. For the former, five precepts would be the guiding light: abstain from taking life, lying, theft, sensual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the latter, a multitude of disciplinary rules would govern their lives. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth of suffering; the origin of suffering, attachment; the cessation of suffering, a state of liberation; and the path leading to the cessation of suffering. Like a mighty river, these truths would flow through the centuries, shaping the destiny of the Theravada community, their waters ever-changing, yet remaining steadfast in their essence.",
            "The United States and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, had been locked in a bitter rivalry that stretched for nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893. The animosity between them had been a slow-burning fire, fueled by divergent values and irreconcilable interests. The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a brutal conflict that left its scars, marked the apogee of this rivalry, as the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. But the enmity between the two nations did not subside with the war's end; rather, it simmered, periodically erupting into violent clashes and disputes over territory, culture, and tradition.\n\nThe rivalries that beset the United States and Mexico were not unique; many nations sharing a border have been rent asunder by similar tensions. The vicissitudes of history and geography had forged a bond between the two nations, a bond that, like a festering wound, refused to heal. As David M. Pletcher noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States had created a web of entanglements, a knot that would not untie easily.\n\nThe gulf between the United States and Mexico was, in part, a product of the deep-seated distrust that had been inherited from their respective colonial pasts. The English and Spanish, the former colonizers of both nations, had left behind a legacy of animosity, a residue that would take generations to dissipate. This mutual distrust had given rise to a series of disputes, both great and small, that would etch themselves into the annals of history. Sally Frahm observed that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). In the rivalry between the United States and Mexico, this ideological chasm had been exacerbated by the competing interests of the two nations, each vying for dominance on the continent.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 discrete disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry, the majority of which revolved around territorial issues. Border raids, banditry, and outlaws had long plagued the frontier, a problem that would require the application of military force to resolve. Schmitt (1974) noted that it was only when Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States that the rivalry began to slowly abate, its flames finally extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the later years of the 19th century.",
            "Darkness crept in, a slow and insidious thing, seeping into the marrow of his bones fifteen years past. A sickness he had never known before, a thief that stole his livelihood and left him broken and alone. He was a nurse, a healer of others, yet he found himself unable to heal himself. The mantra of his youth, a hollow promise of security, now taunted him with its emptiness: \"You'll always find work, people will always get sick.\" The words echoed through his mind like a dirge, a reminder of all he had lost.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of his own making, he wandered, a man without a purpose. Forty-six years old, with nothing to his name but the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. The days blurred together in a never-ending struggle, a fight for survival in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Yet, amidst the ruin, he found solace in the love of his family and a handful of loyal friends. They were the anchor that held him fast, the lifeline that kept him from being swept away by the torrent of despair.\n\nHe knew that life is a fragile thing, a delicate balance of events that can tip at any moment into chaos. Emergencies come without warning, their arrival swift and merciless. And when they do, we are forced to confront the limits of our own strength. We are reminded that no matter how well we prepare, there are some challenges that cannot be overcome alone.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of conservatives, is a thin veil that conceals the truth. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains did not make their journey alone; they were bound together by a shared sense of purpose and a reliance on one another. They knew that in times of hardship, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the community that stands together.\n\nHe, too, had prepared for the worst. His disaster kit was stocked, his first aid supplies ready, his water purifying tablets at the ready. He had flashlights, candles, and waterproof matches, a pantry filled with canned goods and a small store of seeds for a garden. But he knew that true strength lies not in the tools we gather, but in the bonds we forge with others. And so, he did what he could to build a community, to create a network of support that would see him through the darkest of times.\n\nHe knew his neighbors, and they knew him. They checked in on him, offered what little they could, and he did the same for them. They were a threadbare patchwork quilt, stitched together by the love and the need to survive. And in this fragile tapestry, he found a sense of purpose, a reason to keep going when all seemed lost.\n\nThe Conservatives may speak of rugged individualism, but he knew the truth: that it is in our shared humanity, our compassion, and our mutual support that we find the strength to face the unknown. And so, he would continue to build his community, to nurture the relationships that sustained him, and to remember that in the end, it is not the individual who stands alone, but the collective that stands strong.",
            "In the barren expanse of time, the question persists: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints that guide the trajectory of change, or is it a meandering path without rhyme or reason? Even the venerable D'Arcy Thompson, in his prescient words of 1917, acknowledged that the zoologist had yet to grasp the essence of organic forms, to pin them down in the cold, unforgiving language of mathematics. And yet, nearly a century later, the same enigma remains. The application of mathematical modeling to the growth and evolution of mollusk shells, a field pioneered by Raup and Stanley in 1981, offers a glimmer of hope in this darkness. Our own study seeks to unravel the mysteries of Prunum's skeletal development, by combining mathematical modeling with the rigors of experimental research.\n\nWe began by subjecting X-radiographic images of Prunum species to a careful analysis, distilling them into quantitative parameters that could be fed into the software program CerioShell, devised by Stone in 1995. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a tapestry of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. The results, a testament to the power of mathematical abstraction, have shed new light on the boundaries of possible change in this ancient lineage.\n\nConsider the shell, that most curious of structures, a tube that traverses the passage of time, a spiral path etched across the fabric of space. The revolutions of the shell, its whorls, are like the pages of a book, each one a chapter in the story of the mollusk's growth. The columella, a central axis, runs through the heart of the shell, a thread that stitches together the disparate parts. The suture, a line that separates each whorl, is like a seam that binds the fabric of the shell, a testament to the mollusk's ceaseless striving to build and adapt.\n\nThe shell, a labyrinthine structure, presents itself to us in various guises: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the opening facing us, is like a doorway to the mysteries within. The shell's apex, the tip of the spire, is a pinnacle of form, a point of no return, while the base, the opposite end, is a reminder of the mollusk's humble beginnings.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must first view the shell from the apical angle, then draw a line that divides the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that belies the shell's organic, living essence. The trajectory of the aperture, a path that winds through time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a dance of coordinates and radii that charts the shell's growth.\n\nAnd so, by varying the parameters, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, a digital alchemy that transmutes the raw materials of growth into the finished form of the shell. The possibilities are endless, a labyrinth of possibilities that stretches out before us like the shell's own spiral path.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Indonesia's health statistics, a steadfast truth remains: the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have stalled for ten arduous years. Like a stagnant lake, the country's progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals hangs precariously in the balance. While the waters of progress lap gently against the shores of water and sanitation targets, the tides of child and maternal health remain mired in stagnation. The reasons for this morass are manifold, a tangled web of complexities that necessitate a reevaluation of the country's health system, rather than a piecemeal approach to programmatic interventions.\n\nA meager 72% of births in Indonesia are now attended by skilled health workers, a figure that belies the stark reality of the traditional workers – midwives – who stand powerless to intervene in the face of complications. The maternal deaths that follow, a heavy toll of hemorrhage, serve as a stark reminder of the limitations of this statistic. Meanwhile, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has taken a precipitous decline, a dismal trend that underscores the need for urgent attention. The data on postnatal care is as incomplete as the dark recesses of a forgotten cave, but one thing is clear: the rates are appallingly low, a testament to the country's stubborn neglect of this critical area.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a mere 4%, is a stark indictment of the country's healthcare infrastructure. The chasm between urban and rural areas, a 5% difference, is a canyon of inequity, a reminder that access to healthcare services is a luxury reserved for the privileged few. The vertical equity gap, a yawning 27% chasm, highlights the woeful truth that out-of-pocket costs have become an insurmountable barrier for the poor, condemning them to a life of substandard care.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of healthcare reform, the question of how to address the dearth of services looms large. Should the country chart a course of program-specific approaches, or should it focus on strengthening the overall health system, eschewing the narrow focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and rapid results, is undeniable. However, the drawbacks are as numerous as the stars in a midnight sky. The diversion of resources to a single area, the clustering of human resources in areas of greater financing, and the duplication of services, all serve to create a maelstrom of inefficiency and waste.",
            "In the twilight of the era, novels of the Victorian persuasion were beset by an undue fondness for minute particulars and an unwavering fixation on the nobility of the time. However, two works that diverged from this mold were Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These narratives deftly wove an aura of mystery and an air of the inexplicable, a departure from the conventions of their era, thus imbuing their protagonists with a depth of character that laid bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Fagin's world unraveled, Oliver's mind was beset by a maelstrom of disjointed thoughts. The words of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a cacophony in his mind, still lingered in his ears. The world around him dissolved into chaos as the sound of gunfire rent the air, and he felt himself being swept up by an unseen force. The turmoil of his surroundings was a mere backdrop to the gnawing pain that dogged him, a constant reminder of the fragility of life.\n\nThe employment of mystery in these novels often manifested through the device of dreamlike states or visions, though the content and purpose of these episodes varied between the two works. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic happenings served to illuminate the depths of Oliver's inner world, revealing his anguish and his nascent understanding of the true nature of his circumstances. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28, where Oliver relives the event in vivid detail, serves to underscore the powerlessness that had come to define his existence. His senses numbed, he was helplessly borne away by an unseen force, his pain now a constant, gnawing companion that had supplanted the initial shock of fear. This sequence of events serves to underscore the notion that Oliver's fate was not his own to control, but rather the result of forces beyond his comprehension. The protagonist's growing sense of defeat is also palpable, as if Fagin's influence had sapped his will, leaving him a hollow shell of his former self, devoid of the capacity to resist his circumstances.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the passage of time is similarly distorted, as if the very fabric of reality had been rent asunder. The day, a fleeting entity, was already gone, lost in the darkness of night, which, in turn, was both interminable and ephemeral, its silence oppressive, its hours ticking away with all the urgency of a countdown to oblivion.",
            "A couple of years ago, I found myself lost in the depths of an after-school program, surrounded by the faint scent of desperation and the gnawing hunger of students struggling to find their place in the labyrinth of learning. It was there that I took on the task of tutoring elementary-aged students, attempting to guide them through the hallways of English and reading. My feeble attempts at assistance were met with varying degrees of success, but one boy in particular, Adrian, seemed to confound me. His eyes, like dark pools of water, reflected a world both familiar and alien, as if the very fabric of language had been torn asunder, leaving him lost and adrift.\n\nHis precise pronunciation of certain letters, like a cadence of rain on steel, seemed at odds with his inability to grasp the rest. It was as if the alphabet had been laid out before him like a cryptic map, its meaning shrouded in mist. I was drawn to him, a moth to the flame of understanding, and together we navigated the twisted paths of language. But it wasn't until I met his mother, a woman with skin as dark as the earth and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world, that the truth began to seep into my consciousness like a slow-moving tide.\n\nHer words, like the rustle of dry leaves, were a language I struggled to decipher, a dialect that spoke of a world beyond the confines of my understanding. And yet, in that moment, I grasped the truth: Adrian's struggles were not with reading itself, but with the alphabet, a puzzle he had yet to assemble. I wondered if this revelation had brought him solace, or if the weight of his struggles still bore down upon him like a physical presence.\n\nI share this tale for one reason: to confront the specter of the language barrier that haunts our schools, particularly in California's storied landscape. It is a monster that lurks in the shadows, its presence felt but rarely seen. I tell it to challenge the notion that the problem is as simple as it seems, that even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of reading.\n\nWe must recognize that the solution is not a simple one. The dual language system, a notion both elegant and flawed, holds promise but also raises its own set of challenges. Can we require all teachers to be bilingual? The notion seems as absurd as the thought of a tree growing in the desert. No, but what if we were to surround our students with bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we choose to call them? Would that not be a step in the right direction?\n\nThe statistics speak of the benefits of two-way bilingual education programs: children who participate in these programs outperform their peers academically. But the fear persists, a specter that haunts our collective conscience. We fear the waste of resources, the notion that the majority will reap no benefit. But what if we were to invert this thinking, to see the value not in the individual but in the collective? What if we were to adopt this approach as the rule, rather than the exception?\n\nIn this unforgiving landscape of learning, we must find a way to bridge the chasm between language and understanding. It is a task that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the complexities of a world that is as much a puzzle as it is a canvas. I offer no easy answers, only the whispered promise of a solution that lies in the intersection of language and understanding.",
            "From the moment we are small, we are told of a world beyond our own, a world that dwarfs our comprehension. Some are shepherded to Sunday school, others to Temple, and still others are left to wander in search of answers within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many of us cling to the faith imparted by our forebears, while others reject it outright, skeptical of the notion that there is anything beyond the narrow confines of our own existence. We weave a tapestry of values, ever shifting, ever adapting, our understanding of the cosmos oscillating between certainty and doubt.\n\n\"My favorite bird,\" my father said, his voice a low murmur, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above us. The gutters groaned, releasing a deluge of water that drowned the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes lost in thought, a faraway look that was both searching and remembering. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging limply from his bones, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt a shroud of fear and solitude settle over me, unable to broach the subject of his impending departure, for to speak of it would only make it more real, more unbearable. I wrapped my arms around him, pulled back, and joined him in his vigil, lost in the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father passed into the void in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but to what end, I couldn't fathom. What kind of god would exact this toll? I thought to myself, alone in the darkness. I offered no prayers, for if a god existed, it had long since ceased to listen. I had chosen not to witness his passing, to spare myself the agony of watching life ebb from his frame. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not have wanted me to bear witness to his final moments. I curled into a ball, hiding in the darkness, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one came to break the silence.",
            "In the twilight of understanding, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, a marriage of the ancient and the modern, a dissonant harmony of old and new. As Ian Watt astutely observed, this genre is an oxymoron, a union of disparate elements that defies categorization. The Gothic mode has been disparaged for its perceived lack of depth, yet lauded for its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The earliest exemplar of this genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of medieval romance and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary tapestry.\n\nWalpole's use of \"old\" theatrical elements and \"new\" naturalistic descriptions served as a deliberate contrivance, a calculated blend of the archaic and the modern. He dubbed this innovative approach \"A Gothic Story,\" a notion that would come to define a genre that would be both nostalgic and avant-garde (Walpole 4). The Gothic tradition drew upon the dramatic conventions of medieval theatre, the grandeur of Gothic architecture, and the mystique of medieval chivalry, yet it also spoke to the anxieties of a modernizing world.\n\nIn an era where the term \"Gothic\" was applied to a range of peoples, styles, and epochs, it was often seen as a relic of a bygone era, a quaint anachronism in the face of progress. The Gothic novel, however, managed to transcend this perception by embracing the tension between the old and the new, the theatrical and the naturalistic. This dichotomy allowed the genre to endure, to remain both outdated and fresh to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most enduring hallmarks of the Gothic mode is its fascination with chivalry, that medieval ideal of the noble knight. The chivalric code, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, served as a benchmark against which the corruption and decay of modern society could be measured. Writers like Walpole, who were disillusioned with the social and political currents of their time, saw in chivalry a lost ideal, a golden age of morality and virtue that had been supplanted by the cynicism and pragmatism of the modern world.\n\nIn The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a bygone era is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies the chivalric ideals of his forebears. His description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight, his very existence a testament to the lingering presence of a bygone era (66). This excess of chivalric traits serves as a foil to the decay and corruption that pervades the modern world, highlighting the tension between the ideal and the actual, the old and the new.\n\nThus, the Gothic Novel stands as a testament to the power of nostalgia, a genre that speaks to the anxieties and longings of a bygone era. In its exploration of the chivalric ideal, it reveals a profound ambivalence towards the modern world, a world that is seen as both corrupt and fascinating. The Gothic Novel remains a testament to the enduring power of the human imagination, a genre that continues to captivate and inspire readers to this day.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a lone stream winds its way, a labyrinthine process of goods in transit, from the customer's cry for want to the raw materials that lay the foundation for the entire edifice. This was the concept of supply chain management, born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of planning and control. He beheld the entire process, a grand tapestry of threads that wove together to satisfy the needs of the customer in a dance of efficiency and speed.\n\nSix essential strands comprise this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The managers of commerce, they who navigate these waters, employ these six threads to weave a cloak of satisfaction for their customers. For in the production stage, the very first strand, lies the foundation of the entire edifice. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined. The managers must listen to the whispers of the market, that great indicator of the customer's desires. And once they have grasped the market's pulse, they may decide upon the products to be created, and in what quantity.\n\nBut production is a thread that is easily tangled. For every detail, every stitch, is crucial to the entirety. A single misstep can unravel the entire fabric, costing the company dearly in time and money. I recall the precise protocols of Wal-Mart and Target, two behemoths of commerce, where every aspect of the business was mapped out with precision. From the uniform of the employee to the reception of shipments, every step was choreographed to ensure a smooth and efficient dance.\n\nAnd so we come to the second strand, supply. This is the domain of strategic decisions, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined, and partnerships are forged. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its ownequipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is best suited to the product's processes. And perhaps, to further streamline the process, the work may be outsourced to other companies. This is the concept of velocity, the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nBut the question remains, what is the ultimate goal of this grand tapestry? Is it not to satisfy the customer, to provide a product that meets their needs in a swift and efficient manner? The managers of commerce, they who weave this tapestry, must ever be mindful of this goal, lest the threads become tangled, and the entire edifice crumbles.",
            "He stood in the ruins, his eyes fixed on the faded sign. The letters wore like worn stones, their edges chipped and weathered. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA, they declared. A stark pronouncement in a world gone to dust. He gazed out upon the devastation, the skeletal remains of a once-thriving city. The streets a labyrinth of rubble and ash, the buildings reduced to charred skeletons that pierced the gray sky like shattered bone.\n\nA figure emerged from the haze, a young woman with a cardboard sign held aloft like a flag. Ellen Page, a name that meant nothing to him, stood frozen in time, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words scrawled on her sign seemed to writhe like a dying thing, a Sharpie's dark stroke bleeding into the cracked and faded surface. Burma, once a land of golden temples and ancient forests, had become a battleground, a clash of steel and stone, of flesh and blood.\n\nHe thought of the monks, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance in a land gone mad. The Saffron Revolution, a name that whispered through the wind, a testament to the power of the human spirit. But the junta had crushed it, their guns and their hatred silencing the voices of the people. The foreign journalists, with their cameras and their words, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their voices silenced forever.\n\nHe thought of the death toll, a number that swelled like a dark tide, a flood of blood that had stained the earth. Thirteen, they said, but Colonel Hla Win spoke of thousands, of bodies piled high like cordwood, of lives extinguished by the hand of the oppressor. He thought of the Roman emperors, their claims of divinity a thin veil for their tyranny. Of the Japanese emperors, their supposed godhood a mockery of the divine. And of the present day, where leaders spoke of their own infallibility, their words dripping with the honey of deceit.\n\nThe world was a tapestry of blood and ash, a weave of suffering and pain. He thought of the Tiananmen Square, the June 4th protest, where students and intellectuals had gathered to demand their rights. The death toll had been staggering, a number that danced in the wind like a ghost. And Rwanda, the genocide that had consumed a nation, leaving nothing but ash and bone in its wake. The Third Reich, a dark stain on the earth, a reminder of the depths of human depravity.\n\nHe stood there, lost in the wreckage of a world gone mad, the sign's words seared into his brain like a brand. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA. The words seemed to pulse with a malevolent life, a reminder of the darkness that lurked in the heart of every human being. And in that moment, he knew that the world was a place of endless sorrow, a place where the light of hope flickered like a dying candle, threatened by the wind of despair.",
            "In the twilight of his years, Duke Ellington's legacy in the realm of jazz was forged, a testament to his unwavering dedication and the boundless creativity that coursed through his veins like a dark and vital river. His presence on the piano was a subtle but essential undercurrent, one that allowed the individual members of his orchestra to flourish like wildflowers in a verdant meadow. Ellington's masterful compositions, a symphony of intricate patterns and harmonies, provided a framework for the soloists to unfurl their talents, to improvise like leaves on a breezy autumn day. His skill in orchestrating the disparate voices of his players created a rich tapestry, one that wove together the threads of individual style and sound to produce music that was at once coherent, original, and sublime.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a venerable tome that chronicles the annals of musical history, speaks to Ellington's innovative spirit in its discussion of Creole Love Call, a piece that showcased his revolutionary approach to incorporating the human voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, deliberate  twelve-bar blues, a masterclass in subtlety and restraint, demonstrated Ellington's ability to coax texture and color from the voice, untethered from the burdens of lyrics. Creole Love Call, with its six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's capacity to complement the unique styles of his soloists, a gift that was evident throughout his oeuvre. The structure of the piece unfolds like a dark and winding stream, each chorus a tributary that feeds into the larger whole:\n\nChorus 1: A gentle call and response between voice and reeds, the voice gliding smoothly like a summer breeze, before roughening like the bark of a winter tree.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that probes the depths of the melody, lingering on blue notes like a solitary bird in a deserted sky.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo that soars like a bird in flight, its high register a piercing cry that cuts through the stillness, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase that rustles like leaves in an autumn gale.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response that reverberates through the reed and brass sections like the gentle lap of waves on a summer shore.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds assume the role of the caller, their voices rising like a dark and foreboding storm, backed by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections, a rhythmic heartbeat that pulses like a drum in the night.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, the voice assuming the growl technique, soloing like an instrument, its rough, rasping texture a testament to the power of the human voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a tag, a brief and dissonant novelty that shatters like a broken glass on the stones of time, a final, fleeting impression that lingers like the ghost of a forgotten memory.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a testament to his boundless creativity and innovative spirit, was a stylistic trait that permeated his work, a thread that wove together the disparate elements of his music like a spider's web in the moonlight. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington refined his craft, combining tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color, as the call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich and complementary sound, like the perfect harmony of two voices in a summer breeze. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) continued these ideas, as Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, sinuous elegance, like a snake slithering through the underbrush of a forgotten forest.",
            "She felt the void within her, a gnawing hunger that would not be satiated. It began to take hold when she was a girl, around the age of fourteen, as she stumbled into the awkward dance of adolescence. Three years passed, and the yearning remained, a constant, gnawing presence. She had come to realize that it was not a thing she sought, but a connection, a person to bridge the chasm within her. Yet, the boys that came and went, their clumsy attempts to woo her, only served to deepen the mystery. She puzzled over it, a riddle she could not solve, a question she could not answer.\n\nIn the stillness of her home, where her parents' calm and gentle words were the gentle lapping of a stream, she was a wild bird, a tempest in a teapot, her fiery spirit a challenge to the serenity that surrounded her. They argued, her parents and she, but it was never about the noise, the passion, the fire that burned within her. It was about her independence, her need to stretch her wings, to take flight. But today, the calm was shattered. The kitchen, a sanctuary, was shattered. Her mother's cry, a scream, shattered the stillness. She rushed in, her heart racing, her mind reeling. Her mother lay on the floor, a tortured figure, her words torn from her lips in short, gasping breaths. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out to comfort, to hold, to steady. \"Okay, Mom, tell me where to take you.\" The words tumbled from her lips, a mixture of panic and urgency. Her mother's hand guided hers, and with a strength born of love and determination, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradled her in her arms, and carried her to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her heart pounding in her chest, her mind fixed on the task at hand.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, assailed her, but she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She guided her to the reception desk, called for help, and watched as the wheels turned, the doctors arrived, and her mother was whisked away. She was left to wait, to worry, to wonder. Her mother had fallen, slipped off a stool, trying to reach a vase from a high cabinet. A simple accident, a moment's carelessness, and now her mother lay broken, her world shattered.",
            "The wilderness of the human heart, in its perpetual quest for sustenance, has long been drawn to the siren's call of the Mediterranean Diet.  Like a pilgrim navigating the labyrinthine paths of existence, a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" has been found to guide those who adhere to its ancient wisdom toward the Promised Land of reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, and the mortalities that stalk them like specters.  This sacred score, a modified version of the venerable Mediterranean Diet, beckons with its promise of higher consumption of plant foods - the verdant and life-giving fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - and the gentle touch of monounsaturated fat, like a summer breeze on a sun-kissed day.  And yet, like the dualities of existence, it tempers this bounty with the restraint of lower consumption of animal products and the noxious fumes of saturated fats.\n\nIn the annals of prior studies, the Med Diet has been found to be a harbinger of hope, an inverse association between its adherence and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality a beacon in the darkness.  An intervention trial, like a crucible of fire, has shown the Med Diet to be more effective than its low-fat counterpart in promoting the shedding of excess weight and the lowering of the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  Yet, like the elusive nature of the human heart, prior studies had not plumbed the depths of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this, the latest chapter of our inquiry, we followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had embarked on the grand adventure of life, their hearts unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  These women, participants in the majestic Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, were asked to chart their nutrient intake through six self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) over a span of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004.  Like the unwavering dedication of a pilgrim, more than 95% of these women continued their participation throughout this odyssey.  The FFQs, like the ancient scriptures of the past, were subjected to validation studies, their reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke confirmed by the weight of medical records, hospital logs, autopsy reports, and death certificates.  Where records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, like the whispered secrets of the wind, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo chart the labyrinthine paths of life, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs, like the measured paces of a man journeying through the wilderness.  We adjusted for the confounding variables of age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, like the solemn oaths of a vow.\n\nLike the unfathomable mysteries of the human heart, Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke.  And lo, we found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were found.  Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, like the radiant light of a beacon shining in the darkness, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The waste of a nation. A devastation wrought not by the hand of war nor the ravages of time, but by the wantonness of men. In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the United States of America succumbed to the abyss of a crushing financial crisis. Like a tree struck by lightning, the economy lay shattered, its limbs broken, its roots uprooted. The aftermath still lingers, a perpetual reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the fertile soil of 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by the insatiable hunger for power, relaxed the shackles of lending, unleashing a torrent of sub-prime loans into a financial system already teetering on the brink. Like a blind man feeling his way through a dark room, the nation careened towards the precipice, oblivious to the consequences of its actions. Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was coerced into expanding its reach, fueled by the insatiable demands of the Clinton administration and the siren song of profit.\n\nA prophetic voice, that of Steven Holmes of the New York Times, sounded a warning in 1999, but his words fell on deaf ears. \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The seeds of destruction were sown, and the consequences were inevitable. As Holmes foresaw, the government-subsidized corporation would indeed run into trouble, prompting a government rescue that would rival the calamity of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nThe economy, once a behemoth of strength and vitality, was now a fragile vessel, precariously balanced on the razor's edge. The intricate web of mortgage-backed securities, adjustable-rate mortgages, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) had ensnared the very fabric of the nation's financial system, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to the slightest tremor. The housing market, once a symbol of promise and prosperity, had become a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury upon the world.\n\nAnd unleash it did. The housing bubble burst, like a stormy tempest, ripping through the nation's financial institutions like a scythe through wheat. The top five U.S. investment banks, once proud and mighty, now lay shattered, their assets totaling $4.1 trillion dollars, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the nation.\n\nThe nation stands today, scarred and battered, a testament to the wantonness of men. The financial crisis, a calamity of our own making, serves as a stark reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass. We must learn from the lessons of the past, lest we repeat the mistakes of our forebears and succumb to the abyss once more.",
            "The siren's call of exposition beckons, a treacherous shoal where the unwary writer risks shipwrecking their narrative on the rocks of tedium.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across her keyboard, her eyes scanning the blank page as she wrestles with the demon of Too Much Information.  The words flow, a cascade of exposition that threatens to drown the reader in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nBut what is exposition, this great betrayer of the written word?  Is it not the devil on the shoulder, whispering sweet nothings in the author's ear, urging them to tell, to reveal, to spell out the intricate tapestry of their characters' pasts?  In the world of film, exposition is the tedious monologue, the core-dump of information that leaves the audience checking their watches, counting down the minutes until the credits roll.\n\nYet, in the realm of fiction, the author's role is not that of a pedant, but of a weaver.  The writer must skillfully spin the threads of narrative, using every word, every phrase, every sentence to craft a tapestry of character, of world, of emotion.  To do this, they must eschew the temptation of exposition, that great siren's call, and instead show their readers the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.\n\nConsider the example of a heroine who meets her beloved at a certain place and time, marries him in a grand ceremony, and watches as he is brutally murdered before her eyes.  Two pages of detailed exposition might tell us this sequence of events, relegating the characters to mere footnotes in a narrative that cares more for the telling than the showing.  But what if, instead, the author took the time to craft a character with depth, with nuance, with a rich inner life?  What if the heroine's love for her husband was not just a given, but a slow-burning flame that warmed her very soul?  What if her marriage was a dance of give and take, a delicate balance of give and take that spoke to the very heart of her being?\n\nIn that moment, when the author chooses to show, not tell, the reader becomes more than just a passive observer.  They become an active participant, invested in the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their ultimate fate.  They mourn the loss of the husband, not just because of what the author tells them, but because of the slow-burning fire of the heroine's love, a flame that flickers with every heartbeat, every whispered promise, every tender gesture.\n\nSo, dear writer, take heed.  The siren's call of exposition is a treacherous one, tempting as it may be to rush past the details, to reveal too much, too quickly.  But it is in the showing, not the telling, that we find the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.  It is in the slow, careful crafting of character, of world, of emotion, that we find the true power of the written word.",
            "I sat before the box, a cold glass window to the world, and watched as the faces of the damned danced upon its screen. The first came from a city called Columbus, a place I'd never set foot in, yet its stories seared themselves into my mind like brands on the hide of a steer. A man, Shad Hostettler by name, had taken the life of his wife, the details scarce, the images of his face twisted in a grimace, a visage of pure malevolence. The news crew moved on, their gaze lingering on the wound, a fleeting glance at the shattered soul of the woman, and then they left him to his darkness.\n\nThe next story, a young life laid low by the cruel hand of violence, a gunshot wound in the Sharon Woods area, a boy no more than a child, Travis Buyers his name. The news crew's interest waned, their words a whispered rumor, a hushed tone, as if the worth of his life was measured by the color of his skin. The faces of his people, dark and unremarkable, blended into the background, a forgotten scene in the grand tapestry of suffering.\n\nA shot in the night, a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet's kiss in the darkness, a .22 caliber rifle's deadly whisper. The news crew's eyes gleamed with a hunger for the sensational, a five-thousand dollar reward dangling like a carrot on a stick, a siren's call to the soul of the hunter.\n\nThe forecast, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a weekend of gray skies and wet earth, the temperatures a mere afterthought, a whisper in the wind. The news crew's gaze drifted, their attention snagged on the next shiny thing, the next tale of woe to be spun.\n\nA robbery, a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie sweatshirt, a six-foot frame, a hundred and fifty pounds, the news crew's words a litany of details, a drumbeat of racism, a reminder that some lives are less valuable than others.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a name that echoed through the annals of time, a convicted kingpin, a man who'd peddled death and destruction, a sentence of 300 months, a number that hung in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the damned. His skin, a darker shade, a label applied like a brand, a reminder that some lives are bound to their fate, their worth measured by the color of their skin.\n\nI turned off the box, the faces fading into the darkness, the stories lingering in my mind like a cold wind, a whispered warning of a world gone mad, a world where lives are reduced to labels, where some are valued and others are cast aside like so much trash.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unbreakable, forged in the fire of shared blood and experience. It is a bond that holds within it a labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and the darker recesses of the human heart. In its depths, a brother sees not merely his sibling, but a reflection of himself, a mirror held up to the darkest corners of his own soul. It is in the most desperate of times that this bond is laid bare, revealing the very essence of their bond, whether it be redemptive or destructive. The consequences of this bond are a heavy burden to bear, a weight that must be shouldered by those who would walk this difficult path.\n\nIt is this very bond that is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers bound together by ties of blood and experience. Against a backdrop of a lush, decaying world, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their footsteps echoing through a landscape that seems to be slowly withering away. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a crescendo in a scene that will leave only one brother standing. The theme of this tale is woven throughout the narrative, a tapestry of complex emotions that are revealed through the characterization of Doodle, the younger brother, and the narrator's own introspective voice, which serves as a window into the inner workings of his mind.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's actions lies a single emotion: pride. It is a pride that is born of disappointment and frustration, of a desire to have a brother who can share in his joys and his sorrows. From the moment he and Doodle set out on their journey together, the protagonist is beset by a sense of resentment towards his younger brother. He had envisioned a companion, a partner in adventure, a brother who could keep pace with him in the wilds of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart and weakened limbs made such dreams seem like a cruel mockery. The young protagonist's fantasies are crushed, his world turned upside down by the harsh reality of his brother's limitations.\n\nIn the face of this disappointment, the protagonist's anger and frustration boil over, tempting him to consider the unthinkable: the suffocation of his own brother. It is a chilling thought, one that speaks to the darker recesses of the human heart. And yet, when Doodle smiles at him, something within the protagonist softens, his resolve weakened by the simple act of his brother's happiness. It is a fleeting moment, one that speaks to the enduring power of love and compassion in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the end, it is this bond between the two brothers that is the true subject of the story, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, a reminder that the complexities of human emotion can never be fully understood, but only experienced. It is a bond that will haunt the protagonist for the rest of his days, a reminder of the choices he made, and the consequences that followed.",
            "In the depths of the human form, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a tapestry of information woven from the threads of perception. As the world outside evolves, the metaphors that attempt to grasp its inner workings also shift, from the wax tablet of ancient lore to the modern computer, a complex mechanism that reflects the nascent understanding of the brain's workings. \n\nYet, these analogies, like fragile bridges, stretch across the chasm between the inner and outer worlds. They falter and fail, often leading to misconceptions and missteps in the pursuit of knowledge. The brain, a furnace of creative combustion, processes the sensory embers that ignite from the world around us – a caress of warmth, the thrum of sound, the vibrant dance of light. These sparks are transformed, transmuted by the brain's alchemy, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up, the pieces are assembled, a puzzle of color, shape, and contour, until the brain's machinery presents a coherent picture. Top-down, the understanding deepens, the object takes shape, and the mind's eye beholds its form.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, the brain's attention filter intervenes, a gatekeeper that determines what signal is worthy of consideration, what cognitive paths to illuminate. The world, a tapestry of details, is reduced to its essence, the noise diminished, the signal amplified. The attention filter is a subtle art, a delicate balance between the irrelevant and the vital, the fleeting and the eternal.\n\nInformation, a fleeting spark, must be stored, encoded, and maintained. The brain's memory, a palimpsest of experiences, is etched with the marks of sensation, of feeling, and of thought. There are many levels of memory, each a distinct stratum in the brain's stratigraphy. Sensory memory holds the brief, evanescent impressions of the world; working memory, a fleeting shadow, holds the information of the moment; long-term memory, a vast, dark repository, holds the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery, a labyrinth that has yielded to numerous theories, each a thread in the tapestry of understanding. The semantic network model proposes a web of interconnected nodes, each a concept, linked by the bonds of association. The brain's vast, uncharted territories, a cartography of the mind, await exploration, a journey into the depths of the self.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of modernity, a specter of control looms, as envisioned by Aldous Huxley in the dystopian novel Brave New World. The impending threat of technology and the capitalistic system that upholds it is a dire portent, foretold in the bleak world of Huxley's creation. Here, the people are conditioned to prioritize community above individuality, their desires and aspirations suffocated by the insatiable need for immediate gratification. The citizens, mere pawns in a grand game, are ensnared by the World Controller's ideology, their wills shackled to the whims of their oppressors.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theology, Huxley's critique of the emerging economy of his time becomes starkly apparent. The pervasiveness of homogeny and reification in Brave New World serves as a scathing indictment of the societal ills that accompany unchecked capitalism. The Marxist notion of false consciousness is exemplified in the World State's manipulation of the common citizenry, rendering them oblivious to the true nature of their economic relations with the ruling class. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, and beyond, are reduced to mere automatons, their desires shaped by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, which instills in them an insatiable hunger for consumption and indulgence. This conditioning is, of course, orchestrated by the World Controller, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses.\n\nHegemony, the phenomenon of a dominant group exerting control over the subordinate classes, is a hallmark of the World State's totalitarian regime. The lower castes, ensnared in a web of ideological control, are oblivious to their oppression, while the upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, acquiesce to their station, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalist exploitation. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are devoid of depth, a stark reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love, a fundamental aspect of human experience, is all but extinct, replaced by a shallow, superficial existence, where relationships are reduced to calculated transactions, devoid of passion or authenticity.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the societal classes are complicit in their own subjugation, their complacency a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. Their unwavering obedience to their assigned roles within the hierarchy serves as a grim reminder of the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to conform, consume, and obey. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a searing critique of the capitalistic system, a system that threatens to reduce humanity to a mere shadow of its former self, a soulless, loveless existence, devoid of hope or aspiration.",
            "It has been two and a half years since I stepped foot onto the grounds of University Park, the sprawling campus a labyrinth of buildings and pavement that stretches as far as the eye can see. For many, including myself, navigating this vast terrain is a daily struggle. My freshman year, I was ensconced in a dorm room in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a place where the only sounds that echoed through the halls were the distant hum of the stadium and the rustling of leaves in the wind. To reach classes in the Willard building, a bastion of learning that stood at the very heart of the campus, was a journey of 25 minutes on foot, a trek that seemed to take an eternity, especially when the rain poured down or the cold winds howled through the streets.\n\nBut it wasn't always so. I learned from an alumnus not much older than myself that in days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood apart from the rest of the campus, surrounded by a vast expanse of empty land that seemed to stretch on forever. That wilderness has since given way to a new era of development, with sports fields, gleaming new buildings, and apartments springing up like a phoenix from the ashes. As the campus continues to expand, the once-manageable distances between buildings have grown longer, making it a chore to get from one place to another.\n\nSo, what is the solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, it is the bicycle. Not just any bicycle, but one that is wielded by a student who is willing to take to the roads and brave the elements. For it is not the bicycle alone that holds the key to solving this problem, but rather the symbiosis between the student, the bike, and the campus itself. A campus that is built with the needs of the bicyclist in mind, with bike lanes, bike racks, and secure storage facilities, can make all the difference.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a friend who had recently taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said with a smile. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he's right. For not only does bicycling provide a healthy dose of exercise, but it is also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more, a feat that would be impossible on foot.\n\nAs someone who now lives off-campus, I can attest to the benefits of having a bike. What was once a 25-minute walk to class in Thomas building now takes a mere 5 minutes on my bike. Of course, there are challenges to bicycling, especially on roads like Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to my classes. But for me, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Without my bike, I would be forced to rely on walking, a option that would take up an additional 30-40 minutes of my day, every day. That's over two and a half hours every week, time that I simply cannot spare.\n\nIn the end, the solution to the problem of mobility on campus is not just a matter of providing more bike lanes or bike racks. It's about creating a campus that is designed with the bicyclist in mind, a campus that values the efficiency, the exercise, and the independence that comes with riding a bike. For it is only when we prioritize the needs of the bicyclist that we can truly create a campus that is functional, sustainable, and just."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I had always been drawn to the unforgiving aspects of the human experience, the way the darkness creeps into the corners of our lives like a cold wind. It was this morass of suffering that drove me towards the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to a career in social work. I aim to navigate the treacherous waters of human relationships, guiding those who have been ravaged by the cruelty of abuse and neglect, and offering a beacon of hope to families torn asunder.\n\nAs I embark on this journey, I am guided by a set of values that have been etched into my very being: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These principles are not merely abstract ideals, but a reflection of my own unshakeable convictions. I have always been moved by the desire to help others, to ease the burden of their torment, and to offer a listening ear to those who have been silenced.\n\nMy path to this profession has been long and winding, marked by moments of doubt and uncertainty. As I navigated the hallowed halls of high school and college, I witnessed the devastating effects of denial and the destructive nature of poor coping mechanisms. It was this stark reality that led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that has given me a deeper understanding of the human condition. But it was not until I encountered a young boy, a teenager who had been driven to the brink of despair by the cruelty of his parents, that I knew I had found my calling.\n\nThat summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to this boy, a soul as fragile as a leaf in the autumn wind. He was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. I saw in him a spark of resilience, a flame that flickered despite the attempts to extinguish it by those who were supposed to love and protect him. It was this encounter that galvanized me, that set me on a path towards social work.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of social justice. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we often strive for conformity, seeking to blend in with the crowd rather than stand out as a beacon of uniqueness. I reject this notion, embracing instead the beauty of individuality, of being a thread that stands out in a tapestry of sameness. Throughout my years in high school and college, I have fought against social injustice, a crusade that has taken many forms: from the bold statement of my hair, to the piercing of my ears, to my unwavering commitment to the causes of the GSBA. I will continue to fight for what I believe in, even in the face of adversity.\n\nAs I move forward on this journey, I am aware that the road ahead will be fraught with challenges, that the darkness will often seem overwhelming. But I am resolute, my commitment to social work a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. I will continue to navigate the shadows, to seek out those who have been lost, and to offer a hand of hope to those who have been broken. For it is in the darkness that we find the beauty of the human spirit, a resilience that can overcome even the most insurmountable obstacles.",
            "In the depths of a desolate landscape, where the shadows of sleep disorders cast their dark specter, lies the complex tapestry of insomnia. A disorder that shrouds the lives of many, its etiology a labyrinth of biological and sociocultural pathways. The biological model, a study of the innate and acquired aspects of sleep, weaves a narrative of genetic predispositions and physiological abnormalities. The neurons in the hypothalamus, like sentinels of the night, regulate the balance of wakefulness and slumber. The orexin neurons, messengers of the somnambulant realm, rely on the GABAB receptors to modulate the ebb and flow of consciousness. A study of mice, a microcosm of humanity, revealed that the activation of GABAA receptors induces a somnolent state, while their inhibition renders the animal calm and sleep-prone (Matsuki et al., 2009). The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for repose, increased sleep time, underscoring the notion that the genetic and environmental interplay governs the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor can disrupt the nocturnal vigil, leaving an individual vulnerable to the whims of an insomniac existence.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a tapestry of environmental relationships, threads together the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic determinants of sleep disorders. The canvas of demographics, a rich and varied hue, reveals the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia. A study of the inherited phenotype, a genetic blueprint, suggests that the receptor's regulation of sleep can be influenced by environmental factors, weaving a complex narrative of causality and consequence. The sociocultural implications of this study reveal that the absence or malfunction of the GABAB receptor can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the individual but also their relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.\n\nThe Primary sleep disorders, a category of insomnia, include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, each a distinct thread in the tapestry of sleep disturbances. Dyssonmias, characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder, a canvas of Axis I and Axis II disorders, involve sleep difficulties as a symptom of underlying conditions.\n\nThe review of insomnia, a somber and introspective journey, critiques the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a nuanced analysis that reveals the complexities of the biological and sociocultural models. The research on the GABAB receptor, a catalyst for sleep, highlights the genetic and environmental interplay that governs the regulation of consciousness. The sociocultural implications of this study underscore the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia, a reminder that the consequences of sleep disorders extend far beyond the realm of the individual, impacting relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human mind, a disorder wanders, unseen and unfelt, a Central Auditory Processing Disorder, its presence a whisper in the darkness. Like a cracked mirror, it distorts the reflection of sound, reflecting a reality that is not quite our own. The brain, that labyrinthine city, cannot collect the scattered shards of auditory information, cannot weave them into a coherent tapestry. The sounds that assail it, a cacophony of chaos, are lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. This is CAPD, a condition that mocks the notion of order, a disorder that defies diagnosis, a specter that haunts the halls of perception.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the 1950s, a faint cry in the wilderness of human understanding. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari kindled a flame of inquiry in 1954, their work a beacon in the darkness. The model of the brain's auditory processing, a map of the twisted paths and hidden caverns, began to take shape. Kimura's dichotic testing, a litany of sound and silence, revealed the hidden workings of the brain, a machinery of perception, creaking and groaning under the weight of its own complexity.\n\nBut what are the symptoms of this disorder, this twisted mirror that reflects a world askew? The person afflicted may stumble in the darkness, unable to localize the source of sound, like a traveler lost in a forest without a compass. They may struggle to differentiate between the gentle rustle of leaves and the harsh cry of a stranger. The sounds that assail them, a cacophony of chaos, may be lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. They may not be able to synthesize the clues, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, to make sense of the world. They may be unable to determine the sequence of events, like a traveler lost in a labyrinth, unable to find the exit.\n\nDiagnosis, a quest for the truth, a search for the hidden patterns, is a perilous journey. The patient must be screened, tested, and probed, like a traveler in a foreign land, searching for a hidden passage. The tools of the trade, a assortment of tests and questionnaires, may reveal the hidden truth, but like a map of a mountain range, the terrain is treacherous, and the path uncertain. There is no single test, no one tool, that can reveal the truth, like a shining light in the darkness. The disorder, a chameleon, shifts and changes, a will-o-the-wisp, leading the seeker on a wild goose chase.\n\nIn the end, it is the teacher, that steadfast guide, who must navigate the treacherous waters of the classroom, who must find a way to reach the student, to make sense of the sounds, to weave them into a coherent tapestry. The teacher, a weaver of words, a storyteller of sounds, must find a way to make the student see, to hear, to understand. It is a task of wonder, a quest for the impossible, a journey into the very heart of the human mind.",
            "In the dusty tomes of literature, a play stands out like a bleached bone in the desert: Twelfth Night. A work that exposes the nuanced dance of deception, where the cracks of a persona can shatter like the brittle earth beneath a man's boot. The cultivation of disguise, a tool wielded by the cunning, can serve to enthrall and conceal, but it is a fragile thing, liable to unravel at the slightest touch. The question lingers, a specter haunting the frayed edges of our understanding: to shed the disguise, or to cling to it, risking the loss of one's very self.\n\nIn the subterfuge of Viola's transformation, we find a searching question: what drives one to don the guise of another? Is it self-preservation, a flickering flame of hope in a world fraught with danger? Or is it something more profound, a hunger to supplant one's own identity with another's? Viola's desperation to escape the perils of a foreign land has her donning the garb of a man, but in doing so, she forges a chasm between herself and the women who might offer her solace. Her ruse is so convincing that it ensnares Olivia, who confuses her with the illusory Sebastian, and Orsino, whose passions are stirred by the very presence of Viola/Cesario.\n\nYet, as we peer into the crevices of this play, we find that deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting both ways. It can liberate, allowing the hidden to emerge from the shadows, as in the case of Olivia and Orsino, whose suppressed desires are laid bare by the guise of Viola. Or it can ensnare, trapping one in a labyrinth of self-delusion, as in the case of the characters who mistake appearance for reality.\n\nThe question lingers, a ghostly whisper in the darkness: what lies beneath the surface of Olivia's ardor for Cesario? Is it a genuine affection, or a shallow attraction born of societal expectations? Her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian seems to suggest the latter, a parody of the superficial judgments that plague her world. This is a world where appearance holds sway, where the eyes see only what lies on the surface, and the heart remains hidden.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night stands as a testament to the fraught nature of deception, a delicate balance between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships. It is a play that reminds us that our guises, though they may shield us from the world, are also a thin veil, ever-precarious and prone to tearing. As we navigate the complexities of identity and deception, we are forced to confront the question: what lies at the heart of our true selves, and what are we willing to sacrifice to preserve our masks?",
            "The shadows of colonialism stretched far and wide, their brutality seared into the annals of history like the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama, whose genocide in German South West Africa stands as a testament to the empire's unyielding grip on the colonies. And yet, like a labyrinth, the German colonial empire defied reduction to a single narrative, its policies and rulers as varied as the landscapes they sought to conquer. Educational provision, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony a different tapestry woven from the same dark loom.\n\nIn East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of Africans schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge, their minds awakened by the German colonial endeavor. The praise of contemporary authors bore witness to the successes of German education in Kamerun and other colonies, where the promise of enlightenment seemed within reach. But South West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark, unyielding contrast. Here, the task of educating the native was left to the mercy of missionary societies, their endeavors woefully underfunded and unsupported by the colonial government. And yet, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary schools with an iron fist. This double standard would have far-reaching consequences, leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of the African population.\n\nSouth West Africa remained a land of darkness, where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The divergent experience of this colony was the result of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, each thread intricately woven into the tapestry of colonial history. This paper seeks to unravel these factors, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to expand the discussion through the lens of new research.\n\nThe written record of education in the German colonial empire is vast and largely in German, a legacy of the colonial era. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, sought to describe the educational systems of the various colonies, their authors driven by a desire to catalog the empire's accomplishments. Later writings, penned in English, took a more comparative approach, highlighting the differences between the colonies and probing the intricacies of education in each. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands as a landmark work, its author's comparisons and analyses illuminating the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in the colony's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, though temperate in certain regions, was harsh and unforgiving, its vast deserts a testament to the unforgiving nature of the land. Yet, this harsh environment attracted a sizable European population, with nearly 15,000 whites calling the colony home by 1913. In contrast, the settler population of East Africa, the next largest, numbered a mere 5,336.",
            "In the unrelenting sprawl of popular music, a genre has risen like a behemoth from the ashes of sound, its darkness spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of time. Heavy Metal, a moniker born of fire and fury, has grown in complexity over the past four decades, a hydra-like entity that spawns sub-genres like so many hydra's heads, each one a serpent of sound that slices through the air with unyielding ferocity. Its early days, a maelstrom of noise and chaos, gave rise to a movement that would forever change the face of music, a movement that would revel in the darker corners of the human experience.\n\nLike a river that flows from its source to the sea, Heavy Metal has taken on the waters of other genres, incorporating their themes and motifs into its ever-evolving tapestry. But its essence remains unyielding, a stubborn refusal to be bound by the constraints of melody or harmony. It is a music of excess, of bombast, of sheer, unadulterated energy. And at its heart, a darkness that pulses like a living thing, a darkness that draws its power from the very depths of the human condition.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of melodic sweetness, once unleashed a torrent of sonic fury with \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that would become a benchmark for the Heavy Metal genre. Its frantic energy, its obsessive rhythms, its unrelenting drive – all these spoke to a generation's desire to break free from the constraints of conventional music, to unleash a maelstrom of sound that would shatter the stillness of the air. And in that moment, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would forever change the face of music.\n\nBut what is Heavy Metal, really? Is it a genre, a movement, a way of life? It is all these things, and more. It is a reflection of our deepest fears, our darkest desires. It is a manifestation of our primal selves, our animalistic urges, our most basic needs. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our baser instincts.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was fueled by the excesses of the 1970s, a decade of psychedelic experimentation and reckless abandon. But it was also a response to the darkness that lay just beneath the surface of our society, a darkness that would eventually boil over into the chaos of the 1980s. And in the aftermath, Heavy Metal emerged, a phoenix from the ashes, its wings spread wide, its eyes blazing with a fierce, unyielding intensity.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal is a hydra-like entity, its many heads snapping and twisting, each one a different manifestation of its unyielding energy. It is a genre, a movement, a way of life. It is a reflection of our darkest selves, our most primal urges. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our basest instincts.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of his mind, there arose a figure, a painter who toiled in obscurity, bound by the chains of his own unbridled ambition. Henri Rousseau, a name whispered in reverence among the art world's elite, fought a solitary battle, a war of wills between the siren song of conformity and the howling wind of creative freedom. His canvas, The Dream, a 1910 masterpiece, stood as a testament to this inner turmoil, a harbinger of the dreams and desires that haunted his every waking moment.\n\nBut who was this man, this Rousseau, and what drove him to such fervent devotion to his craft? Born in the forgotten town of Laval, France, on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, his life was a tapestry woven from the threads of hardship and heartache. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, had known prosperity, but it was a fleeting respite from the drudgery that lay at the heart of their existence. As a young man, Rousseau toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, his art a mere indulgence, a secret kept hidden from the world. Yet, it was in this very darkness that he found solace, a refuge from the crushing weight of his grief, for his first wife, Clémence, had left him, taking with her eight infant children, leaving him with only one, a daughter, Julia.\n\nThe ache within him, a wound that would never fully heal, drove him to take up the brush, to lose himself in the colors and textures of his art. He was a folk painter, a man of the people, and his art reflected this, a testament to the hopes and dreams of the common man. But, in a world where art was a domain of the elite, where the likes of Matisse and his contemporaries reigned supreme, Rousseau's struggle was all the more poignant. For him, recognition was not just a want, but a necessity, a validation of his very existence. And so, he painted, driven by a hunger for acceptance, a desire to be seen, to be heard.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Matisse and Rousseau were not just competitors, but kindred spirits, bound by their passion for art, yet driven by different motivations. Matisse, a master of subtlety, feared the triteness of his craft, while Rousseau, a painter of unbridled enthusiasm, sought to create works so conventional, so mediocre, that he would be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. The Dream, a painting born of this inner conflict, stands as a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, a reflection of the dreams and desires that shaped his life, a reminder that even in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of hope, a light that guides us towards our own unique path.",
            "In the desolate vastness of the human experience, there exists a whispered understanding that ties the frayed threads of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. It is a notion that echoes through the ages, a litany of great thinkers who have attempted to grasp the essence of this connection. John Keats, in his Ode on a Grecian Urn, poignantly encapsulates the symbiosis: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The dichotomy lies not in the learned or the experienced, but in the unseen, the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that defies the confines of language and education.\n\nWe are drawn to ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, with an instinctual reverence, a primal recognition that transcends the realm of the explainable. Both seek to capture the ephemeral, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral. Our attempts at criticism and analysis, however, often fall short, like a faint echo in the void. When we discuss the merits of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may invoke concepts like foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these words falter to convey the very heart of its beauty. When asked what draws us to a particular work of art or literature, we often find ourselves reduced to a hollow phrase, a \"there's just something about it,\" a confession of the inexplicable.\n\nThis transcendental quality, this something that cannot be said, is the shared thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics into a single tapestry. Flannery O'Connor astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, art and morality exist on a plane where description falters, where words and concepts fail to capture the essence. As Wittgenstein remarks, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence that connects ethics and aesthetics, a shared vulnerability to the human experience.\n\nIn the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced. We experience literature, like morality, on a noumenal level, a realm that defies explanation and rationalization. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" The boundaries between art and morality blur, and in this convergence, we find the very essence of our humanity.\n\nIn this desolate, post-apocalyptic world, where the wind howls through the ruins, we cling to the fragments of our collective understanding, the whispered truths that bind us together. Ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, these seeming dichotomies merge into a single, unyielding whole, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of time, a nation emerged, forged from the crucible of disparate elements. Germany, a land of contrasts, born from the shadows of the Alps, where the Bavarian charm of München gives way to the rugged beauty of the Baltic coast in Kiel. The Rhine's storied waters flow through Köln, a city of ancient stones and modernity, to the storied Saxon city of Dresden, where the Elbe River whispers secrets of a bygone era. This cultural tapestry, woven from the threads of various tribes and sources, is a testament to the nation's complexity.\n\nGermania, the ancestral land of the Germans, shrouded in mystery, gave birth to a people whose very name is a subject of scholarly debate. The etymology of \"German\" is a labyrinthine path, traversing the annals of history. Tacitus, a Roman historian, posited that the name originated from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, before crossing the Rhine, had been known as Germans. Their battles against the Gauls, as chronicled by Tacitus, left an indelible mark on the pages of history.\n\nThe Roman conqueror Julius Caesar, in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the vanquished Gauls. This word, taken from the Gauls themselves, speaks to the complex nature of cultural exchange and the fluidity of identity. In his writings, Caesar noted the Germans' unwavering ferocity, waging war with the Gauls in almost daily battles. The origins of the name \"German,\" however, remain shrouded in uncertainty, with some positing a connection to the Gaulish language, while others point to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the Germans' reputation for being a loud and boisterous people.\n\nIn his treatise, De Origine et situ Germanorum, Tacitus penned a vivid portrait of the German people, describing them as an aboriginal nation, unblemished by the influx of foreign blood or cultural influence. The Germans, he wrote, were a people of the sea, arriving on the shores of their ancestral land via ships, not land, and defying the allure of more hospitable climes. The Romans, for their part, contented themselves with conquests and trade, their gaze fixed on the riches of Germania, rather than the land itself.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to make their presence felt in the first century, they existed on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills, yet forever bound to their own identity. In this liminal space, they forged a nation, tempered by the crucible of history, and shaped by the whispers of a distant past.",
            "The void before me spread out like a bleached canvas, drained of color and vibrancy. My mind wandered listlessly, tracing the contours of the scene before me with a detachment that bordered on numbness. Each thought that arose was a fleeting specter, vanishing as swiftly as it appeared, leaving no residue or echo. My consciousness functioned with a mechanical efficiency, processing the visual data with a precision that belied any personal engagement. It was as if I had been severed from the very fabric of thought, left to drift on a sea of sensory input.\n\nIn a distant corner of my mind, a memory stirred – a conversation with an artist, a sage piece of advice that had long since been filed away. He spoke of a technique, a square frame that could tame the chaos of a scene, reducing it to a manageable, comprehensible whole. I recalled the book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" and the exercises that promised to unlock the secrets of artistic vision. But on this occasion, I was too enthralled, too awestruck by the tableau before me to summon the discipline to impose that frame. The world was too vast, too overwhelming, and I stood frozen, a captive of my own wonder.\n\nIn the realm of art, masters had their own predilections – Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's rainbow-hued masterpieces. If I aspired to join their ranks, to be counted among the makers of beauty and meaning, then perhaps this was my starting point – the genesis of my own artistic vision, my own Work in Brown. My hand twitched, eager to grasp the tool of my craft, but it was not the pencil that would shape my destiny, nor the paintbrush that would bring my vision to life. It was something far more mundane, far more prosaic – a handle, a lever, a tool for the task at hand.\n\nMy fingers closed around it, my muscles tensed, and my hand moved with a jerky, spasmodic motion, as if driven by a will of its own. The offending mass refused to yield, stuck fast like a reluctant mollusk on the bowl's porcelain floor. The mop, a limp and lifeless thing, dangled in my hand, while my tie chafed against my throat, a constant reminder of the constraints that bound me to this thankless task. I stood, frozen, my gaze fixed on the putrid mass before me, as the minutes ticked away, each one a small, incremental step towards my own creative desolation.\n\nThe flush, a soothing balm, seemed to wash away my doubts, and I reached for the sheet, my hand extending, slow and deliberate, like a supplicant seeking absolution. The toilet paper, a meager solace, offered little comfort as I wrapped my fingers around it, transforming it into a makeshift mitten. And then, with a slow, deliberate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a ritualistic act, a concession to the sordid task that lay before me.",
            "In a world shrouded in darkness, a plague ravages the nation's young drivers, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake.  It is a problem as old as the road itself, born of inexperience and a reckless abandon that can only be described as a form of self-immolation.  The National Institutes of Health whisper a truth too terrible to ignore: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to handle the unforgiving dangers of the open road.\n\nIt is not merely a question of numbers, but of essence.  The statistics paint a picture of a generation forsaken to the whims of fate, their inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the highway.  Speed, recklessness, and the cruel fate of vehicle rollover – all are the hallmarks of a demographic that refuses to be held accountable for its actions.\n\nAnd yet, this is not a problem of individual failing, but of a collective one.  For when teens ride with their peers, the danger multiplies, a deadly calculus that defies all reason.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has seen the correlation, a grim reminder of the perils that await those who drive with the devil's own children by their side.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stem the tide, states have implemented provisional licenses, limiting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers.  But these measures, though well-intentioned, are nothing more than a stopgap, a palliative that treats the symptoms rather than the disease.  The root of the problem lies deeper, a fundamental issue that speaks to the very essence of adolescence itself.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman has dared to speak the unspoken truth: even the age of 18 is too young for the unforgiving demands of driving.  His research reveals a disturbing desire among the young to court danger for its own sake, a thrall to the sensation that is as old as time itself.  It is a siren's call, beckoning the unwary to the rocks of destruction.\n\nLegislation is the only solution, a straightforward answer to a problem that has been allowed to simmer for far too long.  Schools must continue to teach the fundamentals of driving, but no child under the age of 18 should be allowed to take the wheel.  A provisional permit may still be granted, but with stricter conditions, and a greater emphasis on practical training.  The number of hours required should be standardized, a nationwide measure to ensure that all teens are held to the same standards.\n\nIt is not a novel idea, but a necessary one.  For the sake of the nation's young, we must act, before the death toll reaches catastrophic proportions.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's babies will be hitting the road, and the consequences will be dire.  We owe it to ourselves, to our children, and to the future to take action.  Anything less would be a betrayal of our duty to protect the innocent.",
            "In the musty vaults of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon the Edison films of old. It was a collection of trick films, fourteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. I was drawn to the obscure and the forgotten, the illusions woven within these early reels. My study of these films was a dance with the shadows, a probing of the poetics that governed their creation. And among them, I discovered the evolutionary outliers, the few that dared to break free from the shackles of convention.\n\nThe trick films of the era, it seemed, were bound by the strictures of their time. They were set-bound, confined to the proscenium of a stage, their cameras rooted to a single position. No movement, only stasis. Long shots and medium shots, a static frame that held the world in place. The one shot, one film methodology, an unyielding rule that governed the narrative. But there were whispers of dissent, hints of a new language emerging in the early days of the century.\n\nI noticed that the trick films, despite their artificiality, shared a common trait – their confinement within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera stood steadfast, a sentinel guarding the threshold, never straying to follow the figures or objects within the frame. This composition, born of the theatre and the vaudeville stage, imposed a limitation on the actors' movement, restricting them to a lateral dance, a perpetual side-to-side shuffle. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained still, a faithful witness to the spectacle.\n\nThe proscenium's grip on the films was firm, a hand that guided the gaze of the viewer. Long shots and medium shots dominated the landscape, with close-ups a rare and forbidden fruit. The audience, like the actors, was bound to the middle ground, denied the intimacy of a piercing glance. The theatre's traditions, born of a time when the entire performance was laid bare upon the stage, dictated the visual vocabulary of the trick films.\n\nThe one-shot, one-film rule cast a long shadow over the narrative, limiting the trick films to a few fleeting moments, each a tantalizing glimpse of the impossible. Most were confined to the realm of vaudeville, a brief, shining moment of magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand. Yet, within this strictures, the filmmakers wove a subtle magic, a dance of illusion and deception. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from the early days, revealed itself to be a masterclass in misdirection, a single shot crafted from multiple pieces, each a thread in the tapestry of illusion.\n\nI stood there, surrounded by the ghosts of the past, the Edison films a testament to the early days of cinema. The trick films, with their stilted movements and bound composition, spoke of a time when the art was still finding its voice, its language. And I, a wanderer in the Library of Congress, felt the whispers of that language, the echoes of a world in the making.",
            "In the inclement land of the nascent republic, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a beacon of fervent conviction. His agricultural pursuits and fleeting foray into politics forged a man unyielding in his devotion to the sacred principles of personal freedom and the curbing of government overreach. His agrarian ethos, the bedrock upon which his opinions were founded, guided his discourse on the very fabric of sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary. He saw the fledgling United States as a tabula rasa, untainted by the legacy of colonial rule, a rare opportunity to craft a system of self-governance that would reflect the inherent duality of human nature.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, intertwined and interdependent, each one a vital thread in the tapestry of human existence. He posited that the denial of one right would unravel the entire fabric, leaving the remaining threads tattered and diminished. These rights, he fervently believed, must remain beyond the grasp of the government's grasping hand. The state of nature, he argued, was a realm where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, a dystopian world that civilized society must strive to overcome.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and the evil that resided within humanity. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that government, like its citizens, was a reflection of human virtues and vices. He posited that good principles would safeguard private property, foster agriculture, and temper the excesses of capitalism, while a government founded upon these principles would operate with equity, even in the face of administrations driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was an innate human trait, but one that became pernicious when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the many for the benefit of the few.\n\nIn line with his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, a minimalist Federal government with powers explicitly stated and no more. He recognized the dangers of a vast and expensive Federal authority, prone to despotism, but also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter of the United States, a document that encapsulated the essence of a nation comprising sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "The decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project was a stark precipice, a chasm between the fervor of initiation and the slumber of indifference.  The change in seasons, the New England campus shrouded in winter's chill, may have contributed to the ebbing tide of participation, as the familiar cadence of bicycle and foot traffic gave way to the stillness of frozen earth.  The end of the fall semester brought its own set of distractions - the din of final exams, the whirlwind of grade processing - and the commuter log, a small but vital thread in the tapestry of the project, may have been lost in the tumult.  The holiday season, a time of festive abandon, brought a lull in activity, a pause in the regular rhythms of the semester, and the promise of a month-long respite from the demands of academia.  Yet, it was not until the spring semester resumed, like a phoenix from the ashes, that the project began to stir once more.\n\nBut the decline persisted, a stubborn and unyielding force, and it seemed as though the project itself was a flame flickering in the wind, struggling to stay alight.  The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate bid to rekindle the spark, did bring a brief surge in log submissions, a fleeting respite from the winter's chill, but it was not enough to sustain the momentum, and the numbers continued to dwindle.  It was as though the project was a traveler, caught in the midst of a long and dusty road, where the horizon seemed to stretch out before him like an endless expanse of gray.\n\nAnd so, we were left to ponder the nature of participation, to probe the depths of human psychology, and to consider the allure of the automobile, that great and seductive siren of modern life.  For in the end, it is the freedom, the independence, and the flexibility of the car that prove so alluring, a siren's call that is deeply ingrained in our culture.  The prizes we offered, tokens of our appreciation and our desire to encourage alternative modes of commuting, may have been insufficient, mere trinkets in the grand tapestry of human desire.  But what if we had offered something more, something greater, a shining jewel on the horizon of possibility?  Would it have been enough to stir the hearts of our participants, to rouse them from their slumber and to rekindle the flame of engagement?\n\nWe may never know, but it is a question that haunts us still, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of renewal, of rebirth, and of a new beginning.  And so, we press on, driven by the faint hope that one day, we may find the key to unlocking the secrets of human participation, and that our project may emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In a realm where the instruments of commerce reign supreme, a breed of security emerged, a creature born of innovation and flexibility. The exchange traded fund, or ETF, a chameleon of sorts, donned the guise of a stock, yet possessed the diversification of its index fund brethren. It strode across the exchanges, a flexible and versatile entity, allowing the freedom to buy on margin, sell short, and acquire a single share with each transaction. Though its allure was great, a shadowy presence lurked in the form of expense ratios, lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a specter of commissions haunted each trade. The ETF's panoply of available funds was a veritable tapestry, woven from the threads of diversity.\n\nYet, like all things, the ETF held its pitfalls. A cost to be reckoned with, a commission that accompanied each transaction, like a specter haunting the steps of the prudent investor. It was a prudent exercise, then, for the discerning investor to evaluate the benefits touted by the ETF, to unravel the threads of diversification, and to gauge their extent. The ETF IHF, a creature of fascination, would be our quarry, its top 10 holdings to be scrutinized, compared against the top 10 holdings that comprised the ETF, to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF could rival those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. Would the ETF's promise of diversification hold true, or would there exist a configuration of the same stocks, a hidden pattern, that would yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nIn our pursuit of understanding, we have chosen to concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which accounted for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The numbers below reveal the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF IHF as a whole, we employed a method of normalization, assigning a value of 100% to the total assets, and then calculating the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it becomes apparent that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. At first glance, it seemed that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might provide a higher return with a lower Beta. Yet, the question remained: were these two portfolios statistically different?\n\nTo answer this, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results would reveal whether the differences between the two portfolios were significant, or mere whispers of chance.",
            "In the hollowed halls of literature, where the shadows dance with the whispers of the past, there exists a place of eerie silence, a Dream-Land forged by the masterful hand of Edgar Allan Poe. It is a realm where the boundaries of reality are blurred, where the living and the dead converge, and where the darkness reigns supreme. Here, in this forsaken land, Poe's words bleed into the poetry of another, a Thulé born from the imagination of Goethe, a siren's call to the unknown.\n\nThe echoes of Thulé resound through Poe's \"Dream-Land\", a poem that weaves a tapestry of sorrow, loss, and the eternal longing for a world that has passed. The term \"Thulé\" itself, like a phantom, haunts the lines of the poem, a whispered secret from the depths of the past. Virgil's ancient voice is said to have first uttered this enigmatic word, but it is in Goethe's \"Faust\" that we find its true resonance.\n\nIn the poetic drama of \"Faust\", a tale of love, loss, and damnation, Goethe's King of Thulé stands as a haunting figure, a monarch consumed by grief and despair. His story is one of a king who, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the darkness, his heart heavy with the weight of memories. This is a king who, like the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", is lost in a world devoid of color, a world shrouded in the shadows of the unknown.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, a testament to Poe's mastery of the poetic art. The former is a poem of sorrow, a dirge for a lost love, while the latter is a lament for the very fabric of reality itself. Both are companion pieces, each speaking to the other in a language that is both familiar and yet, utterly alien.\n\nPoe's debt to Goethe is evident in his use of the term Thulé, a nod to the German author's influence on his work. The echoes of Goethe's \"Faust\" can be heard in the dark, haunting landscapes of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker wanders, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of the past. This is a world without color, a world where the light of hope has faded, leaving only the cold, dark shadows of despair.\n\nIn the vast expanse of literary history, Goethe stands as a towering figure, a master of the poetic art. Poe, in his turn, was drawn to the vortex of Goethe's imagination, a siren's call that beckoned him to explore the depths of the human experience. The connection between the two authors is a testament to the power of literature to transcend time and space, to speak to the universal human condition.\n\nIn the words of Poe himself, we find a nod to the enduring legacy of Goethe, a legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of our time. For in the world of literature, there are few greater than the debt we owe to those who have come before us, who have walked the paths of the past, and who have left behind a trail of words that continue to guide us on our own journey through the shadows of the unknown.",
            "Under the cold light of California's laws, a customer who falls prey to an applesauce spill in a grocery store's hallowed halls, yet succeeds in extracting punitive damages from the establishment, might find solace in the knowledge that the store's manager had flouted the warning signs of impending doom. The store's manager, Paul Martin, had been twice informed of the spill's presence – once by Rich Wayne, an employee whose words fell on deaf ears, and again by Mary J. Haddigan, another employee whose pleas for action were similarly ignored. Martin, ensconced in the comfort of his dinner, had chosen to turn a blind eye to the danger that lurked beneath his feet. This deliberate disregard for the well-being of his customers would prove to be a fatal error, one that would leave Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, with a claim for punitive damages that would not be easily dismissed.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a stark picture of negligence and malice. Five slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months preceding Palmer's accident, yet Martin failed to take any meaningful action to address the issue. His cavalier attitude towards customer safety, exemplified by his flippant dismissal of customer complaints, would ultimately prove to be his downfall. The law is clear: in California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Martin's actions, far from being innocent oversights, demonstrate a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of his customers.\n\nThe California courts have long recognized that malice can be inferred when a defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). In this case, Martin's actions demonstrate a callous disregard for the safety of his customers, and a willful failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The question now before the court is whether this conduct rises to the level of despicable, and whether Martin's actions were committed with the requisite level of malice to warrant an award of punitive damages.",
            "Four years past I wrestled with the weight of Islam in a course at CBC.  A contentious subject of discussion was whether the faith itself was a harbinger of hostility.  I found that the question burned brighter with the passage of time, fueled by the embers of 9/11.  As the media's narrative shifted, a yawning chasm opened between the portrayal of Islam as a monolith of terror and its increasingly saccharine depiction in the American landscape.  It seemed inconceivable that just two decades prior, a presidential candidate with a Muslim family background would have been deemed unthinkable.  The concept of Barack Obama, a man whose name became synonymous with hope, would have been anathema in that dark time.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet holds a certain fascination for me, a narrative that seems to defy the historical record.  From what I had previously understood, Muhammad was a figure who compelled conversions through conquest and coercion.  Yet, the biography portrays a man of unassuming nature, a martyr whose humility and compassion drew followers to his cause.  As I delved deeper, I found the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad to be striking.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that rivaled the wonders of the New Testament, seemed designed to underscore Muhammad's character as a humble prophet, unencumbered by the need for proof or validation.\n\nBut this narrative struck me as a deliberate attempt to subvert the truth, to supplant the life and teachings of Jesus with a watered-down, sanitized version of Muhammad's story.  It was as if the writers sought to pilfer the essence of Christ's message and rebrand it as their own, a travesty that diminished the very fabric of the faith.  Furthermore, the reliance on third-hand accounts and hearsay only served to erode the credibility of the narrative, casting a veil of doubt over the entire enterprise.\n\nWhat unsettled me most, however, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  History, however, paints a different picture, one of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power.  I couldn't help but wonder if the true nature of Muhammad's rise to power was known to the Muslim faithful, or if they were complicit in the myth-making that had been spun around his legacy.",
            "The shadows of the Son of God were cast early upon the soul of Christianity, a faint outline of a figure whose teachings were lost in the labyrinthine corridors of time. As the years crept forward like a thief in the night, the true essence of the faith was shrouded in the mists of doctrine and dogma. The spinning of the theological clock, a maddening whirl of dogmatic fires, left the flame of the original message to flicker and die in the cold darkness of forgotten truths. \n\nYet, like the first faint light of dawn, a glimmer of awareness began to stir in the hearts of men. The orthodox, a bastion of tradition, stood rigid and unyielding, their grip on the past unyielding as the unyielding rock of a tormented sea. But the tide of progress, an unstoppable force, surged forward, gathering momentum as it rolled, an energized tsunami that threatened to sweep away the cobwebs of centuries. The voices of dissent, a whispered litany, grew louder, a cacophony of reason and curiosity that pierced the darkness like a shaft of sunlight.\n\nAnd so, the great reversal began, a movement of the heart, a yearning to reclaim the lost, to rediscover the fire that had once burned so brightly. It was a process of unwinding, a stripping away of the accretions that had accumulated over the centuries, a peeling back of the layers of dogma to reveal the unadorned truth. It would be a journey of centuries, a slow and painful process, but one that would ultimately lead to a return to the source, a reclamation of the original intent of the faith.\n\nAs the great reversion gathered pace, the landscape of Christianity was transformed. The diversity of interpretation, a chaotic tapestry of conflicting views, began to weave itself into a single, cohesive thread. The differences that had once seemed insurmountable, the divisions that had rent the fabric of the faith, began to fade away, until, like a great river finding its source, the waters of the soul were clarified, their essence distilled to its purest form.\n\nThis was not a return to the past, but a rediscovery of the future, a reclaiming of the fire that had been lost. It was a journey back to the source, a return to the wellspring of the faith, where the waters of the soul were clear and unadulterated. And when the great reversion was complete, the church, that great institution, would stand strong, a beacon of guidance, a leader on the path to enlightenment.\n\nBut what had occurred over the centuries since the lifetime of Jesus? The seeds of Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity, had been sown in the fertile soil of the Hebrew scriptures. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, had been the bedrock of the faith. Yet, the Jewish population had been rent asunder by division, a fractured community of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk, each with their own unique perspective on the faith.",
            "The Jungle, a tale of a world consumed by its own baser impulses, reveals to us the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. Like a diseased organism, it festers with greed and self-interest, its every fibre straining towards self-preservation above all else. The plutocrats, those masters of the great factories, care not for the well-being of their workers, nor for the world around them, as long as their coffers swell and their power grows. Theirs is a world of smoke and ash, where the great chimneys belch forth their noxious fumes, and the once-pristine waters run thick with the effluent of their neglect.\n\nAs we are drawn into the depths of Packingtown, we find a place where humanity has been reduced to nothing more than a commodity. The workers, toiling in the factories, are nothing more than beasts of burden, their lives reduced to a mere means to an end. The owners and managers, their hearts black as the coal they burn, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor for the suffering they inflict. They are driven by a singular purpose: to accumulate wealth and power, no matter the cost. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This is a world without mercy, a world where the strong prey upon the weak.\n\nAnd yet, it is not just the owners and managers who are to blame. The system itself is corrupt, a cancer that infects every aspect of life. The workers, desperate to survive, are forced to endure conditions that would be unimaginable to us today. They toil for long hours, for pitiful wages, and are cast aside like so much trash when they are no longer useful. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for redress, often prove to be little more than a mockery, preying upon the very people they claim to represent. Thus, we are left with a population that is little more than a mere shadow of humanity, a population that is as helpless as a slave.\n\nIn this bleak world, immorality reigns supreme. The workers, conditioned to survive in a system that offers them no quarter, are left to their own devices. They are forced to eke out a meager existence, dependent on the whims of their oppressors. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a grim testament to the darkest aspects of human nature, and a reminder that, even in the most desperate of times, there is no escape from the abyss that lies at the heart of our own nature.",
            "Many authors employ varied techniques to elicit a particular sentiment or disposition in their readers, some more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of this art, as exemplified in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs disparate adjectives with nouns to conjure a certain ambiance around a subject, imbuing them with a significance that is at once palpable and intangible. Another technique he employs is to assign meaning to symbols, only to later utilize them for a similar purpose. This method is particularly evident in his use of colors, specifically the dichotomy of white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a semantic landscape for these colors, only to utilize them as a harbinger for a particular feeling or reminder around a subject of importance.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of white/gray is particularly noteworthy, as he imbues these colors with a sense of uniformity, with white being synonymous with refinement and elegance, and gray with the patina of age and decay. Initially, he establishes this dichotomy by peppering the novel with instances of both colors, often in tandem. Daisy and Jordan are incessantly clad in white, a ubiquitous presence that extends to the rest of the novel's characters, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's soiree to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time this uniformity is interrupted is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). This juxtaposition serves to further reinforce the notion that white and gray are inextricably linked.\n\nFitzgerald also extends this semantic reach by applying these colors to everyday, mundane objects, thereby underscoring their ubiquity. As Nick traverses the city, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable are rendered as \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity that Fitzgerald seeks to convey. Even common individuals and places are frequently described in terms of these colors: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), while the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving thus established a semantic foundation for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is first evident in Daisy's characterization. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), thereby reducing her to a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further exemplified in her subsequent appearances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "A desolate fertility lay in wait in San Diego County, its soil yearning to be tilled by the patient hands of a farmer. The land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, stood as a testament to the unforgiving beauty of nature. Adjoining the town of Potrero, in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, this land held secrets of the past, its soil scarred by the hands of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who had once called this place home. The weight of this history hung heavy, like the stillness of the chaparral's February mornings.\n\nAs the seasons unfolded, a verdant tapestry of life would bloom: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers would burst forth, their colors and scents a testament to the land's untapped potential. A niche market beckoned, and the prospect of organic community supported agriculture lured many to the area, their waiting lists a testament to the hunger for this wholesome, earthy beauty. The allure of organic eggs and milk, too, drew in the faithful, their taste buds awakened by the promise of untainted purity.\n\nYet, the path to this bounty was fraught with challenges, the delicate balance between profit and preservation a tightrope to walk. The organic farm, a beacon of sustainability, stood as a shining example of the difficulties faced by those who sought to coax life from this unforgiving earth. Intensive labor and management were required, as the farmer's hands wrestled with pests, weeds, and the capricious whims of the soil. Losses were inevitable, and the small-scale operation's lack of efficiency stood in stark contrast to the grandeur of large-scale conventional farming.\n\nIn this crucible, the landowner found themselves torn between the siren song of profit and the seraphic whispers of the land itself. The property, once the domain of Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, now stood as a testament to the fragile dance between humanity and the natural world. The Cleveland National Forest, a sentinel to the north, watched over this fragile balance, its ancient wisdom a reminder of the delicate harmony that existed between the creatures of this land and the land itself.\n\nIn this uncertain landscape, the landowner found themselves searching for a guiding light, a beacon to illuminate the path ahead. Government programs, a lifeline in these uncertain times, offered a glimmer of hope, a means to mitigate the costs and preserve the beauty of this land. But the choices were many, and the road ahead, treacherous. The land, a patient teacher, waited for the farmer's hands to guide it, to coax forth the beauty that lay hidden beneath the surface. The future, a tapestry of promise and peril, beckoned, and the landowner stood at the crossroads, poised to make a choice that would shape the destiny of this 160-acre parcel, and the creatures that called it home.",
            "In the vast expanse of human interaction, cultural nuances hold sway like wisps of smoke that cling to the landscape. Culture, a tapestry woven from the threads of what we are not, as much as what we are, defies a singular definition. It is a labyrinthine entity, its contours shifting like the sands of time. Reducing an entire culture to a single trait - like assigning the label \"stubborn\" to all Russians or \"accommodating\" to all Japanese - is an exercise in futility, a crude approximation of the intricate patterns that underlie the human experience.\n\nAs one navigates the uncharted waters of foreign culture, the tendency to draw comparisons to one's own is a pitfall waiting to befall. The negotiator, seeking to understand the currents of a culture, must delve into its depths, tracing the contours of its history, its prejudices, and its values. It is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its inherent complexities and working within its bounds, especially when the stakes are high, and the bargaining position is precarious.\n\nCulture's reach extends far beyond the borders of nations; it permeates the very fabric of organizations, giving rise to corporate cultures that are as varied as the individuals within them. A company's values, evident in its dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices, can be as mercurial as the wind, shifting from one office to the next, from one region to the next. The American corporate landscape, with its diverse array of company cultures, is a testament to the fluidity of cultural expression.\n\nBut it is the values that underlie a culture that hold the key to understanding its very essence. Values, the bedrock of a culture, dictate the motivations, the priorities, and the very manner in which individuals interact with one another. In a culture where saving face or communal harmony is paramount, the negotiator must tread carefully, lest they inadvertently tread on sensitive ground. Conversely, in a culture where a hard-driven bargain is the hallmark, the negotiator must be prepared to adapt, lest they be left behind in the dust.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural differences, the negotiator must be willing to listen, to learn, and to adapt. By taking the time to understand the opponent on a personal level, they can tailor their approach, like a skilled navigator charting a course through uncharted waters. It is a delicate dance, one that requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of human culture, and a willingness to navigate the complexities that lie beneath the surface.",
            "It was said in the hollow of a man's chest, \"There is no God.\" A phrase oft repeated, a mantra of the forsaken and the lost. It originated in the pages of the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14, and was later taken up by St. Anselm as a cornerstone of his argument for the existence of the divine. Thomas Aquinas followed suit, his own reasoning a tapestry woven from threads of logic and reason. But what of these two proponents of the divine? Which of their arguments holds sway? To approach this question, we must first assume that both men speak of the same God - the God of the Bible, with all its attendant trappings and characteristics. To do otherwise would be to muddy the waters, to turn a straightforward comparison into a muddled morass.\n\nAnd so we begin with the assumption that both men speak of this God, and that their arguments are in defense of a singular, biblical concept. It is with this understanding that we examine the reasoning of St. Anselm. His argument hinges on the notion that the existence of God is inextricably tied to our own understanding of the divine. God, he posits, is that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. We need not look beyond the confines of our own souls to find proof of God's existence. This, of course, is a concept deeply rooted in the idea of faith - that which we cannot see, yet know to be true nonetheless. It is a notion that speaks to the very heart of the human condition.\n\nBut St. Thomas Aquinas takes a different tack. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, a notion that speaks to the rational, logical mind. This is an argument that would serve the evangelist well, for it would allow the spreading of the Gospel without the need for blind faith. And so Aquinas presents five logical arguments in favor of God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each, he posits, speaks to the necessity of God's existence. If a puzzle were incomplete, we could deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece through logic alone, without ever having seen it.\n\nIn the end, both men present valid arguments, yet neither fully captures the complexity of the human experience. Their arguments, while instructive, fail to account for the messy, multifaceted nature of human understanding. We are, after all, creatures of both reason and emotion, of logic and faith. We are torn between the desire for empirical evidence and the whispered promises of the soul. And so, we are left to navigate the twilight realm between the two, where truth and faith entwine like the branches of a withered tree.",
            "In the dim recesses of ancient time, a prince would stir, destined to be known as the Buddha. His life would unfold like a river, its waters dark and unfathomable, until he cast off the tethers of the world and beheld the radiant truth. His teachings would spread like a wildfire, igniting the flame of Buddhism, a fire that would burn for millennia. Yet, like the shifting sands of a desert, its form would change, its essence succumbing to the capricious winds of time. The Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a bastion of orthodoxy, would hold fast to its traditions, even as the Buddha's teachings had never spoken of such festivities as the annual water-cutting ceremony. And so, the differences would accumulate, like the delicate layers of a pearl, from the mundane customs to the very core of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, would be forced to adapt, their doctrines evolving like the silken threads of a spider's web.\n\nIn this tapestry of change, two threads would weave together – the internal and the external. Internal forces would arise from within the community, while external forces would come from without, their intentions either hostile or benign. The distinction would be crucial, for the fate of the Buddhist community hung in the balance.\n\nTo navigate this complex landscape, one must first understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core lies the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a luminous entity, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the sacred teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka reveals the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Anatta, the negation of the self, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, would be the bedrock upon which the edifice of enlightenment was built. Only by grasping these concepts could one shatter the cycle of Sansara, the wheel of birth and death, and free themselves from the fetters of lobha, dosa, and moha.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, would outline the rules for laymen and monks alike. For the former, five precepts would be the guiding light: abstain from taking life, lying, theft, sensual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the latter, a multitude of disciplinary rules would govern their lives. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth of suffering; the origin of suffering, attachment; the cessation of suffering, a state of liberation; and the path leading to the cessation of suffering. Like a mighty river, these truths would flow through the centuries, shaping the destiny of the Theravada community, their waters ever-changing, yet remaining steadfast in their essence.",
            "The United States and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, had been locked in a bitter rivalry that stretched for nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893. The animosity between them had been a slow-burning fire, fueled by divergent values and irreconcilable interests. The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a brutal conflict that left its scars, marked the apogee of this rivalry, as the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. But the enmity between the two nations did not subside with the war's end; rather, it simmered, periodically erupting into violent clashes and disputes over territory, culture, and tradition.\n\nThe rivalries that beset the United States and Mexico were not unique; many nations sharing a border have been rent asunder by similar tensions. The vicissitudes of history and geography had forged a bond between the two nations, a bond that, like a festering wound, refused to heal. As David M. Pletcher noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States had created a web of entanglements, a knot that would not untie easily.\n\nThe gulf between the United States and Mexico was, in part, a product of the deep-seated distrust that had been inherited from their respective colonial pasts. The English and Spanish, the former colonizers of both nations, had left behind a legacy of animosity, a residue that would take generations to dissipate. This mutual distrust had given rise to a series of disputes, both great and small, that would etch themselves into the annals of history. Sally Frahm observed that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). In the rivalry between the United States and Mexico, this ideological chasm had been exacerbated by the competing interests of the two nations, each vying for dominance on the continent.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 discrete disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry, the majority of which revolved around territorial issues. Border raids, banditry, and outlaws had long plagued the frontier, a problem that would require the application of military force to resolve. Schmitt (1974) noted that it was only when Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States that the rivalry began to slowly abate, its flames finally extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the later years of the 19th century.",
            "Darkness crept in, a slow and insidious thing, seeping into the marrow of his bones fifteen years past. A sickness he had never known before, a thief that stole his livelihood and left him broken and alone. He was a nurse, a healer of others, yet he found himself unable to heal himself. The mantra of his youth, a hollow promise of security, now taunted him with its emptiness: \"You'll always find work, people will always get sick.\" The words echoed through his mind like a dirge, a reminder of all he had lost.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of his own making, he wandered, a man without a purpose. Forty-six years old, with nothing to his name but the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. The days blurred together in a never-ending struggle, a fight for survival in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Yet, amidst the ruin, he found solace in the love of his family and a handful of loyal friends. They were the anchor that held him fast, the lifeline that kept him from being swept away by the torrent of despair.\n\nHe knew that life is a fragile thing, a delicate balance of events that can tip at any moment into chaos. Emergencies come without warning, their arrival swift and merciless. And when they do, we are forced to confront the limits of our own strength. We are reminded that no matter how well we prepare, there are some challenges that cannot be overcome alone.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of conservatives, is a thin veil that conceals the truth. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains did not make their journey alone; they were bound together by a shared sense of purpose and a reliance on one another. They knew that in times of hardship, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the community that stands together.\n\nHe, too, had prepared for the worst. His disaster kit was stocked, his first aid supplies ready, his water purifying tablets at the ready. He had flashlights, candles, and waterproof matches, a pantry filled with canned goods and a small store of seeds for a garden. But he knew that true strength lies not in the tools we gather, but in the bonds we forge with others. And so, he did what he could to build a community, to create a network of support that would see him through the darkest of times.\n\nHe knew his neighbors, and they knew him. They checked in on him, offered what little they could, and he did the same for them. They were a threadbare patchwork quilt, stitched together by the love and the need to survive. And in this fragile tapestry, he found a sense of purpose, a reason to keep going when all seemed lost.\n\nThe Conservatives may speak of rugged individualism, but he knew the truth: that it is in our shared humanity, our compassion, and our mutual support that we find the strength to face the unknown. And so, he would continue to build his community, to nurture the relationships that sustained him, and to remember that in the end, it is not the individual who stands alone, but the collective that stands strong.",
            "In the barren expanse of time, the question persists: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints that guide the trajectory of change, or is it a meandering path without rhyme or reason? Even the venerable D'Arcy Thompson, in his prescient words of 1917, acknowledged that the zoologist had yet to grasp the essence of organic forms, to pin them down in the cold, unforgiving language of mathematics. And yet, nearly a century later, the same enigma remains. The application of mathematical modeling to the growth and evolution of mollusk shells, a field pioneered by Raup and Stanley in 1981, offers a glimmer of hope in this darkness. Our own study seeks to unravel the mysteries of Prunum's skeletal development, by combining mathematical modeling with the rigors of experimental research.\n\nWe began by subjecting X-radiographic images of Prunum species to a careful analysis, distilling them into quantitative parameters that could be fed into the software program CerioShell, devised by Stone in 1995. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a tapestry of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. The results, a testament to the power of mathematical abstraction, have shed new light on the boundaries of possible change in this ancient lineage.\n\nConsider the shell, that most curious of structures, a tube that traverses the passage of time, a spiral path etched across the fabric of space. The revolutions of the shell, its whorls, are like the pages of a book, each one a chapter in the story of the mollusk's growth. The columella, a central axis, runs through the heart of the shell, a thread that stitches together the disparate parts. The suture, a line that separates each whorl, is like a seam that binds the fabric of the shell, a testament to the mollusk's ceaseless striving to build and adapt.\n\nThe shell, a labyrinthine structure, presents itself to us in various guises: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the opening facing us, is like a doorway to the mysteries within. The shell's apex, the tip of the spire, is a pinnacle of form, a point of no return, while the base, the opposite end, is a reminder of the mollusk's humble beginnings.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must first view the shell from the apical angle, then draw a line that divides the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that belies the shell's organic, living essence. The trajectory of the aperture, a path that winds through time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a dance of coordinates and radii that charts the shell's growth.\n\nAnd so, by varying the parameters, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, a digital alchemy that transmutes the raw materials of growth into the finished form of the shell. The possibilities are endless, a labyrinth of possibilities that stretches out before us like the shell's own spiral path.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Indonesia's health statistics, a steadfast truth remains: the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have stalled for ten arduous years. Like a stagnant lake, the country's progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals hangs precariously in the balance. While the waters of progress lap gently against the shores of water and sanitation targets, the tides of child and maternal health remain mired in stagnation. The reasons for this morass are manifold, a tangled web of complexities that necessitate a reevaluation of the country's health system, rather than a piecemeal approach to programmatic interventions.\n\nA meager 72% of births in Indonesia are now attended by skilled health workers, a figure that belies the stark reality of the traditional workers – midwives – who stand powerless to intervene in the face of complications. The maternal deaths that follow, a heavy toll of hemorrhage, serve as a stark reminder of the limitations of this statistic. Meanwhile, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has taken a precipitous decline, a dismal trend that underscores the need for urgent attention. The data on postnatal care is as incomplete as the dark recesses of a forgotten cave, but one thing is clear: the rates are appallingly low, a testament to the country's stubborn neglect of this critical area.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a mere 4%, is a stark indictment of the country's healthcare infrastructure. The chasm between urban and rural areas, a 5% difference, is a canyon of inequity, a reminder that access to healthcare services is a luxury reserved for the privileged few. The vertical equity gap, a yawning 27% chasm, highlights the woeful truth that out-of-pocket costs have become an insurmountable barrier for the poor, condemning them to a life of substandard care.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of healthcare reform, the question of how to address the dearth of services looms large. Should the country chart a course of program-specific approaches, or should it focus on strengthening the overall health system, eschewing the narrow focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and rapid results, is undeniable. However, the drawbacks are as numerous as the stars in a midnight sky. The diversion of resources to a single area, the clustering of human resources in areas of greater financing, and the duplication of services, all serve to create a maelstrom of inefficiency and waste.",
            "In the twilight of the era, novels of the Victorian persuasion were beset by an undue fondness for minute particulars and an unwavering fixation on the nobility of the time. However, two works that diverged from this mold were Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These narratives deftly wove an aura of mystery and an air of the inexplicable, a departure from the conventions of their era, thus imbuing their protagonists with a depth of character that laid bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Fagin's world unraveled, Oliver's mind was beset by a maelstrom of disjointed thoughts. The words of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a cacophony in his mind, still lingered in his ears. The world around him dissolved into chaos as the sound of gunfire rent the air, and he felt himself being swept up by an unseen force. The turmoil of his surroundings was a mere backdrop to the gnawing pain that dogged him, a constant reminder of the fragility of life.\n\nThe employment of mystery in these novels often manifested through the device of dreamlike states or visions, though the content and purpose of these episodes varied between the two works. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic happenings served to illuminate the depths of Oliver's inner world, revealing his anguish and his nascent understanding of the true nature of his circumstances. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28, where Oliver relives the event in vivid detail, serves to underscore the powerlessness that had come to define his existence. His senses numbed, he was helplessly borne away by an unseen force, his pain now a constant, gnawing companion that had supplanted the initial shock of fear. This sequence of events serves to underscore the notion that Oliver's fate was not his own to control, but rather the result of forces beyond his comprehension. The protagonist's growing sense of defeat is also palpable, as if Fagin's influence had sapped his will, leaving him a hollow shell of his former self, devoid of the capacity to resist his circumstances.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the passage of time is similarly distorted, as if the very fabric of reality had been rent asunder. The day, a fleeting entity, was already gone, lost in the darkness of night, which, in turn, was both interminable and ephemeral, its silence oppressive, its hours ticking away with all the urgency of a countdown to oblivion.",
            "A couple of years ago, I found myself lost in the depths of an after-school program, surrounded by the faint scent of desperation and the gnawing hunger of students struggling to find their place in the labyrinth of learning. It was there that I took on the task of tutoring elementary-aged students, attempting to guide them through the hallways of English and reading. My feeble attempts at assistance were met with varying degrees of success, but one boy in particular, Adrian, seemed to confound me. His eyes, like dark pools of water, reflected a world both familiar and alien, as if the very fabric of language had been torn asunder, leaving him lost and adrift.\n\nHis precise pronunciation of certain letters, like a cadence of rain on steel, seemed at odds with his inability to grasp the rest. It was as if the alphabet had been laid out before him like a cryptic map, its meaning shrouded in mist. I was drawn to him, a moth to the flame of understanding, and together we navigated the twisted paths of language. But it wasn't until I met his mother, a woman with skin as dark as the earth and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world, that the truth began to seep into my consciousness like a slow-moving tide.\n\nHer words, like the rustle of dry leaves, were a language I struggled to decipher, a dialect that spoke of a world beyond the confines of my understanding. And yet, in that moment, I grasped the truth: Adrian's struggles were not with reading itself, but with the alphabet, a puzzle he had yet to assemble. I wondered if this revelation had brought him solace, or if the weight of his struggles still bore down upon him like a physical presence.\n\nI share this tale for one reason: to confront the specter of the language barrier that haunts our schools, particularly in California's storied landscape. It is a monster that lurks in the shadows, its presence felt but rarely seen. I tell it to challenge the notion that the problem is as simple as it seems, that even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of reading.\n\nWe must recognize that the solution is not a simple one. The dual language system, a notion both elegant and flawed, holds promise but also raises its own set of challenges. Can we require all teachers to be bilingual? The notion seems as absurd as the thought of a tree growing in the desert. No, but what if we were to surround our students with bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we choose to call them? Would that not be a step in the right direction?\n\nThe statistics speak of the benefits of two-way bilingual education programs: children who participate in these programs outperform their peers academically. But the fear persists, a specter that haunts our collective conscience. We fear the waste of resources, the notion that the majority will reap no benefit. But what if we were to invert this thinking, to see the value not in the individual but in the collective? What if we were to adopt this approach as the rule, rather than the exception?\n\nIn this unforgiving landscape of learning, we must find a way to bridge the chasm between language and understanding. It is a task that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the complexities of a world that is as much a puzzle as it is a canvas. I offer no easy answers, only the whispered promise of a solution that lies in the intersection of language and understanding.",
            "From the moment we are small, we are told of a world beyond our own, a world that dwarfs our comprehension. Some are shepherded to Sunday school, others to Temple, and still others are left to wander in search of answers within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many of us cling to the faith imparted by our forebears, while others reject it outright, skeptical of the notion that there is anything beyond the narrow confines of our own existence. We weave a tapestry of values, ever shifting, ever adapting, our understanding of the cosmos oscillating between certainty and doubt.\n\n\"My favorite bird,\" my father said, his voice a low murmur, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above us. The gutters groaned, releasing a deluge of water that drowned the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes lost in thought, a faraway look that was both searching and remembering. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging limply from his bones, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt a shroud of fear and solitude settle over me, unable to broach the subject of his impending departure, for to speak of it would only make it more real, more unbearable. I wrapped my arms around him, pulled back, and joined him in his vigil, lost in the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father passed into the void in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but to what end, I couldn't fathom. What kind of god would exact this toll? I thought to myself, alone in the darkness. I offered no prayers, for if a god existed, it had long since ceased to listen. I had chosen not to witness his passing, to spare myself the agony of watching life ebb from his frame. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not have wanted me to bear witness to his final moments. I curled into a ball, hiding in the darkness, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one came to break the silence.",
            "In the twilight of understanding, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, a marriage of the ancient and the modern, a dissonant harmony of old and new. As Ian Watt astutely observed, this genre is an oxymoron, a union of disparate elements that defies categorization. The Gothic mode has been disparaged for its perceived lack of depth, yet lauded for its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The earliest exemplar of this genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of medieval romance and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary tapestry.\n\nWalpole's use of \"old\" theatrical elements and \"new\" naturalistic descriptions served as a deliberate contrivance, a calculated blend of the archaic and the modern. He dubbed this innovative approach \"A Gothic Story,\" a notion that would come to define a genre that would be both nostalgic and avant-garde (Walpole 4). The Gothic tradition drew upon the dramatic conventions of medieval theatre, the grandeur of Gothic architecture, and the mystique of medieval chivalry, yet it also spoke to the anxieties of a modernizing world.\n\nIn an era where the term \"Gothic\" was applied to a range of peoples, styles, and epochs, it was often seen as a relic of a bygone era, a quaint anachronism in the face of progress. The Gothic novel, however, managed to transcend this perception by embracing the tension between the old and the new, the theatrical and the naturalistic. This dichotomy allowed the genre to endure, to remain both outdated and fresh to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most enduring hallmarks of the Gothic mode is its fascination with chivalry, that medieval ideal of the noble knight. The chivalric code, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, served as a benchmark against which the corruption and decay of modern society could be measured. Writers like Walpole, who were disillusioned with the social and political currents of their time, saw in chivalry a lost ideal, a golden age of morality and virtue that had been supplanted by the cynicism and pragmatism of the modern world.\n\nIn The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a bygone era is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies the chivalric ideals of his forebears. His description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight, his very existence a testament to the lingering presence of a bygone era (66). This excess of chivalric traits serves as a foil to the decay and corruption that pervades the modern world, highlighting the tension between the ideal and the actual, the old and the new.\n\nThus, the Gothic Novel stands as a testament to the power of nostalgia, a genre that speaks to the anxieties and longings of a bygone era. In its exploration of the chivalric ideal, it reveals a profound ambivalence towards the modern world, a world that is seen as both corrupt and fascinating. The Gothic Novel remains a testament to the enduring power of the human imagination, a genre that continues to captivate and inspire readers to this day.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a lone stream winds its way, a labyrinthine process of goods in transit, from the customer's cry for want to the raw materials that lay the foundation for the entire edifice. This was the concept of supply chain management, born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of planning and control. He beheld the entire process, a grand tapestry of threads that wove together to satisfy the needs of the customer in a dance of efficiency and speed.\n\nSix essential strands comprise this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The managers of commerce, they who navigate these waters, employ these six threads to weave a cloak of satisfaction for their customers. For in the production stage, the very first strand, lies the foundation of the entire edifice. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined. The managers must listen to the whispers of the market, that great indicator of the customer's desires. And once they have grasped the market's pulse, they may decide upon the products to be created, and in what quantity.\n\nBut production is a thread that is easily tangled. For every detail, every stitch, is crucial to the entirety. A single misstep can unravel the entire fabric, costing the company dearly in time and money. I recall the precise protocols of Wal-Mart and Target, two behemoths of commerce, where every aspect of the business was mapped out with precision. From the uniform of the employee to the reception of shipments, every step was choreographed to ensure a smooth and efficient dance.\n\nAnd so we come to the second strand, supply. This is the domain of strategic decisions, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined, and partnerships are forged. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its ownequipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is best suited to the product's processes. And perhaps, to further streamline the process, the work may be outsourced to other companies. This is the concept of velocity, the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nBut the question remains, what is the ultimate goal of this grand tapestry? Is it not to satisfy the customer, to provide a product that meets their needs in a swift and efficient manner? The managers of commerce, they who weave this tapestry, must ever be mindful of this goal, lest the threads become tangled, and the entire edifice crumbles.",
            "He stood in the ruins, his eyes fixed on the faded sign. The letters wore like worn stones, their edges chipped and weathered. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA, they declared. A stark pronouncement in a world gone to dust. He gazed out upon the devastation, the skeletal remains of a once-thriving city. The streets a labyrinth of rubble and ash, the buildings reduced to charred skeletons that pierced the gray sky like shattered bone.\n\nA figure emerged from the haze, a young woman with a cardboard sign held aloft like a flag. Ellen Page, a name that meant nothing to him, stood frozen in time, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words scrawled on her sign seemed to writhe like a dying thing, a Sharpie's dark stroke bleeding into the cracked and faded surface. Burma, once a land of golden temples and ancient forests, had become a battleground, a clash of steel and stone, of flesh and blood.\n\nHe thought of the monks, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance in a land gone mad. The Saffron Revolution, a name that whispered through the wind, a testament to the power of the human spirit. But the junta had crushed it, their guns and their hatred silencing the voices of the people. The foreign journalists, with their cameras and their words, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their voices silenced forever.\n\nHe thought of the death toll, a number that swelled like a dark tide, a flood of blood that had stained the earth. Thirteen, they said, but Colonel Hla Win spoke of thousands, of bodies piled high like cordwood, of lives extinguished by the hand of the oppressor. He thought of the Roman emperors, their claims of divinity a thin veil for their tyranny. Of the Japanese emperors, their supposed godhood a mockery of the divine. And of the present day, where leaders spoke of their own infallibility, their words dripping with the honey of deceit.\n\nThe world was a tapestry of blood and ash, a weave of suffering and pain. He thought of the Tiananmen Square, the June 4th protest, where students and intellectuals had gathered to demand their rights. The death toll had been staggering, a number that danced in the wind like a ghost. And Rwanda, the genocide that had consumed a nation, leaving nothing but ash and bone in its wake. The Third Reich, a dark stain on the earth, a reminder of the depths of human depravity.\n\nHe stood there, lost in the wreckage of a world gone mad, the sign's words seared into his brain like a brand. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA. The words seemed to pulse with a malevolent life, a reminder of the darkness that lurked in the heart of every human being. And in that moment, he knew that the world was a place of endless sorrow, a place where the light of hope flickered like a dying candle, threatened by the wind of despair.",
            "In the twilight of his years, Duke Ellington's legacy in the realm of jazz was forged, a testament to his unwavering dedication and the boundless creativity that coursed through his veins like a dark and vital river. His presence on the piano was a subtle but essential undercurrent, one that allowed the individual members of his orchestra to flourish like wildflowers in a verdant meadow. Ellington's masterful compositions, a symphony of intricate patterns and harmonies, provided a framework for the soloists to unfurl their talents, to improvise like leaves on a breezy autumn day. His skill in orchestrating the disparate voices of his players created a rich tapestry, one that wove together the threads of individual style and sound to produce music that was at once coherent, original, and sublime.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a venerable tome that chronicles the annals of musical history, speaks to Ellington's innovative spirit in its discussion of Creole Love Call, a piece that showcased his revolutionary approach to incorporating the human voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, deliberate  twelve-bar blues, a masterclass in subtlety and restraint, demonstrated Ellington's ability to coax texture and color from the voice, untethered from the burdens of lyrics. Creole Love Call, with its six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's capacity to complement the unique styles of his soloists, a gift that was evident throughout his oeuvre. The structure of the piece unfolds like a dark and winding stream, each chorus a tributary that feeds into the larger whole:\n\nChorus 1: A gentle call and response between voice and reeds, the voice gliding smoothly like a summer breeze, before roughening like the bark of a winter tree.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that probes the depths of the melody, lingering on blue notes like a solitary bird in a deserted sky.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo that soars like a bird in flight, its high register a piercing cry that cuts through the stillness, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase that rustles like leaves in an autumn gale.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response that reverberates through the reed and brass sections like the gentle lap of waves on a summer shore.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds assume the role of the caller, their voices rising like a dark and foreboding storm, backed by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections, a rhythmic heartbeat that pulses like a drum in the night.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, the voice assuming the growl technique, soloing like an instrument, its rough, rasping texture a testament to the power of the human voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a tag, a brief and dissonant novelty that shatters like a broken glass on the stones of time, a final, fleeting impression that lingers like the ghost of a forgotten memory.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a testament to his boundless creativity and innovative spirit, was a stylistic trait that permeated his work, a thread that wove together the disparate elements of his music like a spider's web in the moonlight. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington refined his craft, combining tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color, as the call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich and complementary sound, like the perfect harmony of two voices in a summer breeze. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) continued these ideas, as Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, sinuous elegance, like a snake slithering through the underbrush of a forgotten forest.",
            "She felt the void within her, a gnawing hunger that would not be satiated. It began to take hold when she was a girl, around the age of fourteen, as she stumbled into the awkward dance of adolescence. Three years passed, and the yearning remained, a constant, gnawing presence. She had come to realize that it was not a thing she sought, but a connection, a person to bridge the chasm within her. Yet, the boys that came and went, their clumsy attempts to woo her, only served to deepen the mystery. She puzzled over it, a riddle she could not solve, a question she could not answer.\n\nIn the stillness of her home, where her parents' calm and gentle words were the gentle lapping of a stream, she was a wild bird, a tempest in a teapot, her fiery spirit a challenge to the serenity that surrounded her. They argued, her parents and she, but it was never about the noise, the passion, the fire that burned within her. It was about her independence, her need to stretch her wings, to take flight. But today, the calm was shattered. The kitchen, a sanctuary, was shattered. Her mother's cry, a scream, shattered the stillness. She rushed in, her heart racing, her mind reeling. Her mother lay on the floor, a tortured figure, her words torn from her lips in short, gasping breaths. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out to comfort, to hold, to steady. \"Okay, Mom, tell me where to take you.\" The words tumbled from her lips, a mixture of panic and urgency. Her mother's hand guided hers, and with a strength born of love and determination, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradled her in her arms, and carried her to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her heart pounding in her chest, her mind fixed on the task at hand.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, assailed her, but she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She guided her to the reception desk, called for help, and watched as the wheels turned, the doctors arrived, and her mother was whisked away. She was left to wait, to worry, to wonder. Her mother had fallen, slipped off a stool, trying to reach a vase from a high cabinet. A simple accident, a moment's carelessness, and now her mother lay broken, her world shattered.",
            "The wilderness of the human heart, in its perpetual quest for sustenance, has long been drawn to the siren's call of the Mediterranean Diet.  Like a pilgrim navigating the labyrinthine paths of existence, a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" has been found to guide those who adhere to its ancient wisdom toward the Promised Land of reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, and the mortalities that stalk them like specters.  This sacred score, a modified version of the venerable Mediterranean Diet, beckons with its promise of higher consumption of plant foods - the verdant and life-giving fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - and the gentle touch of monounsaturated fat, like a summer breeze on a sun-kissed day.  And yet, like the dualities of existence, it tempers this bounty with the restraint of lower consumption of animal products and the noxious fumes of saturated fats.\n\nIn the annals of prior studies, the Med Diet has been found to be a harbinger of hope, an inverse association between its adherence and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality a beacon in the darkness.  An intervention trial, like a crucible of fire, has shown the Med Diet to be more effective than its low-fat counterpart in promoting the shedding of excess weight and the lowering of the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  Yet, like the elusive nature of the human heart, prior studies had not plumbed the depths of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this, the latest chapter of our inquiry, we followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had embarked on the grand adventure of life, their hearts unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  These women, participants in the majestic Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, were asked to chart their nutrient intake through six self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) over a span of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004.  Like the unwavering dedication of a pilgrim, more than 95% of these women continued their participation throughout this odyssey.  The FFQs, like the ancient scriptures of the past, were subjected to validation studies, their reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke confirmed by the weight of medical records, hospital logs, autopsy reports, and death certificates.  Where records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, like the whispered secrets of the wind, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo chart the labyrinthine paths of life, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs, like the measured paces of a man journeying through the wilderness.  We adjusted for the confounding variables of age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, like the solemn oaths of a vow.\n\nLike the unfathomable mysteries of the human heart, Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke.  And lo, we found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were found.  Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, like the radiant light of a beacon shining in the darkness, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The waste of a nation. A devastation wrought not by the hand of war nor the ravages of time, but by the wantonness of men. In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the United States of America succumbed to the abyss of a crushing financial crisis. Like a tree struck by lightning, the economy lay shattered, its limbs broken, its roots uprooted. The aftermath still lingers, a perpetual reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the fertile soil of 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by the insatiable hunger for power, relaxed the shackles of lending, unleashing a torrent of sub-prime loans into a financial system already teetering on the brink. Like a blind man feeling his way through a dark room, the nation careened towards the precipice, oblivious to the consequences of its actions. Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was coerced into expanding its reach, fueled by the insatiable demands of the Clinton administration and the siren song of profit.\n\nA prophetic voice, that of Steven Holmes of the New York Times, sounded a warning in 1999, but his words fell on deaf ears. \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The seeds of destruction were sown, and the consequences were inevitable. As Holmes foresaw, the government-subsidized corporation would indeed run into trouble, prompting a government rescue that would rival the calamity of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nThe economy, once a behemoth of strength and vitality, was now a fragile vessel, precariously balanced on the razor's edge. The intricate web of mortgage-backed securities, adjustable-rate mortgages, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) had ensnared the very fabric of the nation's financial system, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to the slightest tremor. The housing market, once a symbol of promise and prosperity, had become a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury upon the world.\n\nAnd unleash it did. The housing bubble burst, like a stormy tempest, ripping through the nation's financial institutions like a scythe through wheat. The top five U.S. investment banks, once proud and mighty, now lay shattered, their assets totaling $4.1 trillion dollars, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the nation.\n\nThe nation stands today, scarred and battered, a testament to the wantonness of men. The financial crisis, a calamity of our own making, serves as a stark reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass. We must learn from the lessons of the past, lest we repeat the mistakes of our forebears and succumb to the abyss once more.",
            "The siren's call of exposition beckons, a treacherous shoal where the unwary writer risks shipwrecking their narrative on the rocks of tedium.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across her keyboard, her eyes scanning the blank page as she wrestles with the demon of Too Much Information.  The words flow, a cascade of exposition that threatens to drown the reader in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nBut what is exposition, this great betrayer of the written word?  Is it not the devil on the shoulder, whispering sweet nothings in the author's ear, urging them to tell, to reveal, to spell out the intricate tapestry of their characters' pasts?  In the world of film, exposition is the tedious monologue, the core-dump of information that leaves the audience checking their watches, counting down the minutes until the credits roll.\n\nYet, in the realm of fiction, the author's role is not that of a pedant, but of a weaver.  The writer must skillfully spin the threads of narrative, using every word, every phrase, every sentence to craft a tapestry of character, of world, of emotion.  To do this, they must eschew the temptation of exposition, that great siren's call, and instead show their readers the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.\n\nConsider the example of a heroine who meets her beloved at a certain place and time, marries him in a grand ceremony, and watches as he is brutally murdered before her eyes.  Two pages of detailed exposition might tell us this sequence of events, relegating the characters to mere footnotes in a narrative that cares more for the telling than the showing.  But what if, instead, the author took the time to craft a character with depth, with nuance, with a rich inner life?  What if the heroine's love for her husband was not just a given, but a slow-burning flame that warmed her very soul?  What if her marriage was a dance of give and take, a delicate balance of give and take that spoke to the very heart of her being?\n\nIn that moment, when the author chooses to show, not tell, the reader becomes more than just a passive observer.  They become an active participant, invested in the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their ultimate fate.  They mourn the loss of the husband, not just because of what the author tells them, but because of the slow-burning fire of the heroine's love, a flame that flickers with every heartbeat, every whispered promise, every tender gesture.\n\nSo, dear writer, take heed.  The siren's call of exposition is a treacherous one, tempting as it may be to rush past the details, to reveal too much, too quickly.  But it is in the showing, not the telling, that we find the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.  It is in the slow, careful crafting of character, of world, of emotion, that we find the true power of the written word.",
            "I sat before the box, a cold glass window to the world, and watched as the faces of the damned danced upon its screen. The first came from a city called Columbus, a place I'd never set foot in, yet its stories seared themselves into my mind like brands on the hide of a steer. A man, Shad Hostettler by name, had taken the life of his wife, the details scarce, the images of his face twisted in a grimace, a visage of pure malevolence. The news crew moved on, their gaze lingering on the wound, a fleeting glance at the shattered soul of the woman, and then they left him to his darkness.\n\nThe next story, a young life laid low by the cruel hand of violence, a gunshot wound in the Sharon Woods area, a boy no more than a child, Travis Buyers his name. The news crew's interest waned, their words a whispered rumor, a hushed tone, as if the worth of his life was measured by the color of his skin. The faces of his people, dark and unremarkable, blended into the background, a forgotten scene in the grand tapestry of suffering.\n\nA shot in the night, a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet's kiss in the darkness, a .22 caliber rifle's deadly whisper. The news crew's eyes gleamed with a hunger for the sensational, a five-thousand dollar reward dangling like a carrot on a stick, a siren's call to the soul of the hunter.\n\nThe forecast, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a weekend of gray skies and wet earth, the temperatures a mere afterthought, a whisper in the wind. The news crew's gaze drifted, their attention snagged on the next shiny thing, the next tale of woe to be spun.\n\nA robbery, a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie sweatshirt, a six-foot frame, a hundred and fifty pounds, the news crew's words a litany of details, a drumbeat of racism, a reminder that some lives are less valuable than others.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a name that echoed through the annals of time, a convicted kingpin, a man who'd peddled death and destruction, a sentence of 300 months, a number that hung in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the damned. His skin, a darker shade, a label applied like a brand, a reminder that some lives are bound to their fate, their worth measured by the color of their skin.\n\nI turned off the box, the faces fading into the darkness, the stories lingering in my mind like a cold wind, a whispered warning of a world gone mad, a world where lives are reduced to labels, where some are valued and others are cast aside like so much trash.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unbreakable, forged in the fire of shared blood and experience. It is a bond that holds within it a labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and the darker recesses of the human heart. In its depths, a brother sees not merely his sibling, but a reflection of himself, a mirror held up to the darkest corners of his own soul. It is in the most desperate of times that this bond is laid bare, revealing the very essence of their bond, whether it be redemptive or destructive. The consequences of this bond are a heavy burden to bear, a weight that must be shouldered by those who would walk this difficult path.\n\nIt is this very bond that is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers bound together by ties of blood and experience. Against a backdrop of a lush, decaying world, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their footsteps echoing through a landscape that seems to be slowly withering away. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a crescendo in a scene that will leave only one brother standing. The theme of this tale is woven throughout the narrative, a tapestry of complex emotions that are revealed through the characterization of Doodle, the younger brother, and the narrator's own introspective voice, which serves as a window into the inner workings of his mind.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's actions lies a single emotion: pride. It is a pride that is born of disappointment and frustration, of a desire to have a brother who can share in his joys and his sorrows. From the moment he and Doodle set out on their journey together, the protagonist is beset by a sense of resentment towards his younger brother. He had envisioned a companion, a partner in adventure, a brother who could keep pace with him in the wilds of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart and weakened limbs made such dreams seem like a cruel mockery. The young protagonist's fantasies are crushed, his world turned upside down by the harsh reality of his brother's limitations.\n\nIn the face of this disappointment, the protagonist's anger and frustration boil over, tempting him to consider the unthinkable: the suffocation of his own brother. It is a chilling thought, one that speaks to the darker recesses of the human heart. And yet, when Doodle smiles at him, something within the protagonist softens, his resolve weakened by the simple act of his brother's happiness. It is a fleeting moment, one that speaks to the enduring power of love and compassion in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the end, it is this bond between the two brothers that is the true subject of the story, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, a reminder that the complexities of human emotion can never be fully understood, but only experienced. It is a bond that will haunt the protagonist for the rest of his days, a reminder of the choices he made, and the consequences that followed.",
            "In the depths of the human form, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a tapestry of information woven from the threads of perception. As the world outside evolves, the metaphors that attempt to grasp its inner workings also shift, from the wax tablet of ancient lore to the modern computer, a complex mechanism that reflects the nascent understanding of the brain's workings. \n\nYet, these analogies, like fragile bridges, stretch across the chasm between the inner and outer worlds. They falter and fail, often leading to misconceptions and missteps in the pursuit of knowledge. The brain, a furnace of creative combustion, processes the sensory embers that ignite from the world around us – a caress of warmth, the thrum of sound, the vibrant dance of light. These sparks are transformed, transmuted by the brain's alchemy, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up, the pieces are assembled, a puzzle of color, shape, and contour, until the brain's machinery presents a coherent picture. Top-down, the understanding deepens, the object takes shape, and the mind's eye beholds its form.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, the brain's attention filter intervenes, a gatekeeper that determines what signal is worthy of consideration, what cognitive paths to illuminate. The world, a tapestry of details, is reduced to its essence, the noise diminished, the signal amplified. The attention filter is a subtle art, a delicate balance between the irrelevant and the vital, the fleeting and the eternal.\n\nInformation, a fleeting spark, must be stored, encoded, and maintained. The brain's memory, a palimpsest of experiences, is etched with the marks of sensation, of feeling, and of thought. There are many levels of memory, each a distinct stratum in the brain's stratigraphy. Sensory memory holds the brief, evanescent impressions of the world; working memory, a fleeting shadow, holds the information of the moment; long-term memory, a vast, dark repository, holds the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery, a labyrinth that has yielded to numerous theories, each a thread in the tapestry of understanding. The semantic network model proposes a web of interconnected nodes, each a concept, linked by the bonds of association. The brain's vast, uncharted territories, a cartography of the mind, await exploration, a journey into the depths of the self.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of modernity, a specter of control looms, as envisioned by Aldous Huxley in the dystopian novel Brave New World. The impending threat of technology and the capitalistic system that upholds it is a dire portent, foretold in the bleak world of Huxley's creation. Here, the people are conditioned to prioritize community above individuality, their desires and aspirations suffocated by the insatiable need for immediate gratification. The citizens, mere pawns in a grand game, are ensnared by the World Controller's ideology, their wills shackled to the whims of their oppressors.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theology, Huxley's critique of the emerging economy of his time becomes starkly apparent. The pervasiveness of homogeny and reification in Brave New World serves as a scathing indictment of the societal ills that accompany unchecked capitalism. The Marxist notion of false consciousness is exemplified in the World State's manipulation of the common citizenry, rendering them oblivious to the true nature of their economic relations with the ruling class. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, and beyond, are reduced to mere automatons, their desires shaped by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, which instills in them an insatiable hunger for consumption and indulgence. This conditioning is, of course, orchestrated by the World Controller, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses.\n\nHegemony, the phenomenon of a dominant group exerting control over the subordinate classes, is a hallmark of the World State's totalitarian regime. The lower castes, ensnared in a web of ideological control, are oblivious to their oppression, while the upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, acquiesce to their station, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalist exploitation. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are devoid of depth, a stark reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love, a fundamental aspect of human experience, is all but extinct, replaced by a shallow, superficial existence, where relationships are reduced to calculated transactions, devoid of passion or authenticity.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the societal classes are complicit in their own subjugation, their complacency a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. Their unwavering obedience to their assigned roles within the hierarchy serves as a grim reminder of the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to conform, consume, and obey. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a searing critique of the capitalistic system, a system that threatens to reduce humanity to a mere shadow of its former self, a soulless, loveless existence, devoid of hope or aspiration.",
            "It has been two and a half years since I stepped foot onto the grounds of University Park, the sprawling campus a labyrinth of buildings and pavement that stretches as far as the eye can see. For many, including myself, navigating this vast terrain is a daily struggle. My freshman year, I was ensconced in a dorm room in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a place where the only sounds that echoed through the halls were the distant hum of the stadium and the rustling of leaves in the wind. To reach classes in the Willard building, a bastion of learning that stood at the very heart of the campus, was a journey of 25 minutes on foot, a trek that seemed to take an eternity, especially when the rain poured down or the cold winds howled through the streets.\n\nBut it wasn't always so. I learned from an alumnus not much older than myself that in days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood apart from the rest of the campus, surrounded by a vast expanse of empty land that seemed to stretch on forever. That wilderness has since given way to a new era of development, with sports fields, gleaming new buildings, and apartments springing up like a phoenix from the ashes. As the campus continues to expand, the once-manageable distances between buildings have grown longer, making it a chore to get from one place to another.\n\nSo, what is the solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, it is the bicycle. Not just any bicycle, but one that is wielded by a student who is willing to take to the roads and brave the elements. For it is not the bicycle alone that holds the key to solving this problem, but rather the symbiosis between the student, the bike, and the campus itself. A campus that is built with the needs of the bicyclist in mind, with bike lanes, bike racks, and secure storage facilities, can make all the difference.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a friend who had recently taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said with a smile. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he's right. For not only does bicycling provide a healthy dose of exercise, but it is also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more, a feat that would be impossible on foot.\n\nAs someone who now lives off-campus, I can attest to the benefits of having a bike. What was once a 25-minute walk to class in Thomas building now takes a mere 5 minutes on my bike. Of course, there are challenges to bicycling, especially on roads like Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to my classes. But for me, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Without my bike, I would be forced to rely on walking, a option that would take up an additional 30-40 minutes of my day, every day. That's over two and a half hours every week, time that I simply cannot spare.\n\nIn the end, the solution to the problem of mobility on campus is not just a matter of providing more bike lanes or bike racks. It's about creating a campus that is designed with the bicyclist in mind, a campus that values the efficiency, the exercise, and the independence that comes with riding a bike. For it is only when we prioritize the needs of the bicyclist that we can truly create a campus that is functional, sustainable, and just."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I had always been drawn to the unforgiving aspects of the human experience, the way the darkness creeps into the corners of our lives like a cold wind. It was this morass of suffering that drove me towards the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to a career in social work. I aim to navigate the treacherous waters of human relationships, guiding those who have been ravaged by the cruelty of abuse and neglect, and offering a beacon of hope to families torn asunder.\n\nAs I embark on this journey, I am guided by a set of values that have been etched into my very being: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These principles are not merely abstract ideals, but a reflection of my own unshakeable convictions. I have always been moved by the desire to help others, to ease the burden of their torment, and to offer a listening ear to those who have been silenced.\n\nMy path to this profession has been long and winding, marked by moments of doubt and uncertainty. As I navigated the hallowed halls of high school and college, I witnessed the devastating effects of denial and the destructive nature of poor coping mechanisms. It was this stark reality that led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that has given me a deeper understanding of the human condition. But it was not until I encountered a young boy, a teenager who had been driven to the brink of despair by the cruelty of his parents, that I knew I had found my calling.\n\nThat summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to this boy, a soul as fragile as a leaf in the autumn wind. He was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. I saw in him a spark of resilience, a flame that flickered despite the attempts to extinguish it by those who were supposed to love and protect him. It was this encounter that galvanized me, that set me on a path towards social work.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of social justice. We claim to value the individual, to mourn the loss of those who have been silenced, yet we often strive for conformity, seeking to blend in with the crowd rather than stand out as a beacon of uniqueness. I reject this notion, embracing instead the beauty of individuality, of being a thread that stands out in a tapestry of sameness. Throughout my years in high school and college, I have fought against social injustice, a crusade that has taken many forms: from the bold statement of my hair, to the piercing of my ears, to my unwavering commitment to the causes of the GSBA. I will continue to fight for what I believe in, even in the face of adversity.\n\nAs I move forward on this journey, I am aware that the road ahead will be fraught with challenges, that the darkness will often seem overwhelming. But I am resolute, my commitment to social work a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. I will continue to navigate the shadows, to seek out those who have been lost, and to offer a hand of hope to those who have been broken. For it is in the darkness that we find the beauty of the human spirit, a resilience that can overcome even the most insurmountable obstacles.",
            "In the depths of a desolate landscape, where the shadows of sleep disorders cast their dark specter, lies the complex tapestry of insomnia. A disorder that shrouds the lives of many, its etiology a labyrinth of biological and sociocultural pathways. The biological model, a study of the innate and acquired aspects of sleep, weaves a narrative of genetic predispositions and physiological abnormalities. The neurons in the hypothalamus, like sentinels of the night, regulate the balance of wakefulness and slumber. The orexin neurons, messengers of the somnambulant realm, rely on the GABAB receptors to modulate the ebb and flow of consciousness. A study of mice, a microcosm of humanity, revealed that the activation of GABAA receptors induces a somnolent state, while their inhibition renders the animal calm and sleep-prone (Matsuki et al., 2009). The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for repose, increased sleep time, underscoring the notion that the genetic and environmental interplay governs the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor can disrupt the nocturnal vigil, leaving an individual vulnerable to the whims of an insomniac existence.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a tapestry of environmental relationships, threads together the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic determinants of sleep disorders. The canvas of demographics, a rich and varied hue, reveals the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia. A study of the inherited phenotype, a genetic blueprint, suggests that the receptor's regulation of sleep can be influenced by environmental factors, weaving a complex narrative of causality and consequence. The sociocultural implications of this study reveal that the absence or malfunction of the GABAB receptor can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the individual but also their relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.\n\nThe Primary sleep disorders, a category of insomnia, include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, each a distinct thread in the tapestry of sleep disturbances. Dyssonmias, characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder, a canvas of Axis I and Axis II disorders, involve sleep difficulties as a symptom of underlying conditions.\n\nThe review of insomnia, a somber and introspective journey, critiques the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a nuanced analysis that reveals the complexities of the biological and sociocultural models. The research on the GABAB receptor, a catalyst for sleep, highlights the genetic and environmental interplay that governs the regulation of consciousness. The sociocultural implications of this study underscore the intricate dance between an individual's circumstances and their propensity for insomnia, a reminder that the consequences of sleep disorders extend far beyond the realm of the individual, impacting relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.",
            "In the desolate landscape of the human mind, a disorder wanders, unseen and unfelt, a Central Auditory Processing Disorder, its presence a whisper in the darkness. Like a cracked mirror, it distorts the reflection of sound, reflecting a reality that is not quite our own. The brain, that labyrinthine city, cannot collect the scattered shards of auditory information, cannot weave them into a coherent tapestry. The sounds that assail it, a cacophony of chaos, are lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. This is CAPD, a condition that mocks the notion of order, a disorder that defies diagnosis, a specter that haunts the halls of perception.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the 1950s, a faint cry in the wilderness of human understanding. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari kindled a flame of inquiry in 1954, their work a beacon in the darkness. The model of the brain's auditory processing, a map of the twisted paths and hidden caverns, began to take shape. Kimura's dichotic testing, a litany of sound and silence, revealed the hidden workings of the brain, a machinery of perception, creaking and groaning under the weight of its own complexity.\n\nBut what are the symptoms of this disorder, this twisted mirror that reflects a world askew? The person afflicted may stumble in the darkness, unable to localize the source of sound, like a traveler lost in a forest without a compass. They may struggle to differentiate between the gentle rustle of leaves and the harsh cry of a stranger. The sounds that assail them, a cacophony of chaos, may be lost in the void, like autumn leaves on a windless day. They may not be able to synthesize the clues, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, to make sense of the world. They may be unable to determine the sequence of events, like a traveler lost in a labyrinth, unable to find the exit.\n\nDiagnosis, a quest for the truth, a search for the hidden patterns, is a perilous journey. The patient must be screened, tested, and probed, like a traveler in a foreign land, searching for a hidden passage. The tools of the trade, a assortment of tests and questionnaires, may reveal the hidden truth, but like a map of a mountain range, the terrain is treacherous, and the path uncertain. There is no single test, no one tool, that can reveal the truth, like a shining light in the darkness. The disorder, a chameleon, shifts and changes, a will-o-the-wisp, leading the seeker on a wild goose chase.\n\nIn the end, it is the teacher, that steadfast guide, who must navigate the treacherous waters of the classroom, who must find a way to reach the student, to make sense of the sounds, to weave them into a coherent tapestry. The teacher, a weaver of words, a storyteller of sounds, must find a way to make the student see, to hear, to understand. It is a task of wonder, a quest for the impossible, a journey into the very heart of the human mind.",
            "In the dusty tomes of literature, a play stands out like a bleached bone in the desert: Twelfth Night. A work that exposes the nuanced dance of deception, where the cracks of a persona can shatter like the brittle earth beneath a man's boot. The cultivation of disguise, a tool wielded by the cunning, can serve to enthrall and conceal, but it is a fragile thing, liable to unravel at the slightest touch. The question lingers, a specter haunting the frayed edges of our understanding: to shed the disguise, or to cling to it, risking the loss of one's very self.\n\nIn the subterfuge of Viola's transformation, we find a searching question: what drives one to don the guise of another? Is it self-preservation, a flickering flame of hope in a world fraught with danger? Or is it something more profound, a hunger to supplant one's own identity with another's? Viola's desperation to escape the perils of a foreign land has her donning the garb of a man, but in doing so, she forges a chasm between herself and the women who might offer her solace. Her ruse is so convincing that it ensnares Olivia, who confuses her with the illusory Sebastian, and Orsino, whose passions are stirred by the very presence of Viola/Cesario.\n\nYet, as we peer into the crevices of this play, we find that deception can be a double-edged sword, cutting both ways. It can liberate, allowing the hidden to emerge from the shadows, as in the case of Olivia and Orsino, whose suppressed desires are laid bare by the guise of Viola. Or it can ensnare, trapping one in a labyrinth of self-delusion, as in the case of the characters who mistake appearance for reality.\n\nThe question lingers, a ghostly whisper in the darkness: what lies beneath the surface of Olivia's ardor for Cesario? Is it a genuine affection, or a shallow attraction born of societal expectations? Her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian seems to suggest the latter, a parody of the superficial judgments that plague her world. This is a world where appearance holds sway, where the eyes see only what lies on the surface, and the heart remains hidden.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night stands as a testament to the fraught nature of deception, a delicate balance between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships. It is a play that reminds us that our guises, though they may shield us from the world, are also a thin veil, ever-precarious and prone to tearing. As we navigate the complexities of identity and deception, we are forced to confront the question: what lies at the heart of our true selves, and what are we willing to sacrifice to preserve our masks?",
            "The shadows of colonialism stretched far and wide, their brutality seared into the annals of history like the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama, whose genocide in German South West Africa stands as a testament to the empire's unyielding grip on the colonies. And yet, like a labyrinth, the German colonial empire defied reduction to a single narrative, its policies and rulers as varied as the landscapes they sought to conquer. Educational provision, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony a different tapestry woven from the same dark loom.\n\nIn East Africa, the British inheritance found a population of Africans schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge, their minds awakened by the German colonial endeavor. The praise of contemporary authors bore witness to the successes of German education in Kamerun and other colonies, where the promise of enlightenment seemed within reach. But South West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark, unyielding contrast. Here, the task of educating the native was left to the mercy of missionary societies, their endeavors woefully underfunded and unsupported by the colonial government. And yet, the government lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary schools with an iron fist. This double standard would have far-reaching consequences, leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of the African population.\n\nSouth West Africa remained a land of darkness, where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The divergent experience of this colony was the result of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, each thread intricately woven into the tapestry of colonial history. This paper seeks to unravel these factors, shedding light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to expand the discussion through the lens of new research.\n\nThe written record of education in the German colonial empire is vast and largely in German, a legacy of the colonial era. Early works, penned in the early twentieth century, sought to describe the educational systems of the various colonies, their authors driven by a desire to catalog the empire's accomplishments. Later writings, penned in English, took a more comparative approach, highlighting the differences between the colonies and probing the intricacies of education in each. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands as a landmark work, its author's comparisons and analyses illuminating the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor in the colony's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, though temperate in certain regions, was harsh and unforgiving, its vast deserts a testament to the unforgiving nature of the land. Yet, this harsh environment attracted a sizable European population, with nearly 15,000 whites calling the colony home by 1913. In contrast, the settler population of East Africa, the next largest, numbered a mere 5,336.",
            "In the unrelenting sprawl of popular music, a genre has risen like a behemoth from the ashes of sound, its darkness spreading far and wide like a stain on the fabric of time. Heavy Metal, a moniker born of fire and fury, has grown in complexity over the past four decades, a hydra-like entity that spawns sub-genres like so many hydra's heads, each one a serpent of sound that slices through the air with unyielding ferocity. Its early days, a maelstrom of noise and chaos, gave rise to a movement that would forever change the face of music, a movement that would revel in the darker corners of the human experience.\n\nLike a river that flows from its source to the sea, Heavy Metal has taken on the waters of other genres, incorporating their themes and motifs into its ever-evolving tapestry. But its essence remains unyielding, a stubborn refusal to be bound by the constraints of melody or harmony. It is a music of excess, of bombast, of sheer, unadulterated energy. And at its heart, a darkness that pulses like a living thing, a darkness that draws its power from the very depths of the human condition.\n\nThe Beatles, those icons of melodic sweetness, once unleashed a torrent of sonic fury with \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that would become a benchmark for the Heavy Metal genre. Its frantic energy, its obsessive rhythms, its unrelenting drive – all these spoke to a generation's desire to break free from the constraints of conventional music, to unleash a maelstrom of sound that would shatter the stillness of the air. And in that moment, Heavy Metal was born, a movement that would forever change the face of music.\n\nBut what is Heavy Metal, really? Is it a genre, a movement, a way of life? It is all these things, and more. It is a reflection of our deepest fears, our darkest desires. It is a manifestation of our primal selves, our animalistic urges, our most basic needs. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our baser instincts.\n\nIn its earliest days, Heavy Metal was fueled by the excesses of the 1970s, a decade of psychedelic experimentation and reckless abandon. But it was also a response to the darkness that lay just beneath the surface of our society, a darkness that would eventually boil over into the chaos of the 1980s. And in the aftermath, Heavy Metal emerged, a phoenix from the ashes, its wings spread wide, its eyes blazing with a fierce, unyielding intensity.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal is a hydra-like entity, its many heads snapping and twisting, each one a different manifestation of its unyielding energy. It is a genre, a movement, a way of life. It is a reflection of our darkest selves, our most primal urges. And it is a reminder that, no matter how refined our civilization may seem, we are still, at heart, beasts of burden, driven by our basest instincts.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of his mind, there arose a figure, a painter who toiled in obscurity, bound by the chains of his own unbridled ambition. Henri Rousseau, a name whispered in reverence among the art world's elite, fought a solitary battle, a war of wills between the siren song of conformity and the howling wind of creative freedom. His canvas, The Dream, a 1910 masterpiece, stood as a testament to this inner turmoil, a harbinger of the dreams and desires that haunted his every waking moment.\n\nBut who was this man, this Rousseau, and what drove him to such fervent devotion to his craft? Born in the forgotten town of Laval, France, on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, his life was a tapestry woven from the threads of hardship and heartache. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, had known prosperity, but it was a fleeting respite from the drudgery that lay at the heart of their existence. As a young man, Rousseau toiled in obscurity, a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, his art a mere indulgence, a secret kept hidden from the world. Yet, it was in this very darkness that he found solace, a refuge from the crushing weight of his grief, for his first wife, Clémence, had left him, taking with her eight infant children, leaving him with only one, a daughter, Julia.\n\nThe ache within him, a wound that would never fully heal, drove him to take up the brush, to lose himself in the colors and textures of his art. He was a folk painter, a man of the people, and his art reflected this, a testament to the hopes and dreams of the common man. But, in a world where art was a domain of the elite, where the likes of Matisse and his contemporaries reigned supreme, Rousseau's struggle was all the more poignant. For him, recognition was not just a want, but a necessity, a validation of his very existence. And so, he painted, driven by a hunger for acceptance, a desire to be seen, to be heard.\n\nAs Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Matisse and Rousseau were not just competitors, but kindred spirits, bound by their passion for art, yet driven by different motivations. Matisse, a master of subtlety, feared the triteness of his craft, while Rousseau, a painter of unbridled enthusiasm, sought to create works so conventional, so mediocre, that he would be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. The Dream, a painting born of this inner conflict, stands as a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, a reflection of the dreams and desires that shaped his life, a reminder that even in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of hope, a light that guides us towards our own unique path.",
            "In the desolate vastness of the human experience, there exists a whispered understanding that ties the frayed threads of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. It is a notion that echoes through the ages, a litany of great thinkers who have attempted to grasp the essence of this connection. John Keats, in his Ode on a Grecian Urn, poignantly encapsulates the symbiosis: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The dichotomy lies not in the learned or the experienced, but in the unseen, the ineffable, the je ne sais quoi that defies the confines of language and education.\n\nWe are drawn to ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, with an instinctual reverence, a primal recognition that transcends the realm of the explainable. Both seek to capture the ephemeral, to distill the essence of what makes a work of art beautiful or an action moral. Our attempts at criticism and analysis, however, often fall short, like a faint echo in the void. When we discuss the merits of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may invoke concepts like foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet these words falter to convey the very heart of its beauty. When asked what draws us to a particular work of art or literature, we often find ourselves reduced to a hollow phrase, a \"there's just something about it,\" a confession of the inexplicable.\n\nThis transcendental quality, this something that cannot be said, is the shared thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics into a single tapestry. Flannery O'Connor astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, art and morality exist on a plane where description falters, where words and concepts fail to capture the essence. As Wittgenstein remarks, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence that connects ethics and aesthetics, a shared vulnerability to the human experience.\n\nIn the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced. We experience literature, like morality, on a noumenal level, a realm that defies explanation and rationalization. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" The boundaries between art and morality blur, and in this convergence, we find the very essence of our humanity.\n\nIn this desolate, post-apocalyptic world, where the wind howls through the ruins, we cling to the fragments of our collective understanding, the whispered truths that bind us together. Ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, these seeming dichotomies merge into a single, unyielding whole, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of time, a nation emerged, forged from the crucible of disparate elements. Germany, a land of contrasts, born from the shadows of the Alps, where the Bavarian charm of München gives way to the rugged beauty of the Baltic coast in Kiel. The Rhine's storied waters flow through Köln, a city of ancient stones and modernity, to the storied Saxon city of Dresden, where the Elbe River whispers secrets of a bygone era. This cultural tapestry, woven from the threads of various tribes and sources, is a testament to the nation's complexity.\n\nGermania, the ancestral land of the Germans, shrouded in mystery, gave birth to a people whose very name is a subject of scholarly debate. The etymology of \"German\" is a labyrinthine path, traversing the annals of history. Tacitus, a Roman historian, posited that the name originated from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, before crossing the Rhine, had been known as Germans. Their battles against the Gauls, as chronicled by Tacitus, left an indelible mark on the pages of history.\n\nThe Roman conqueror Julius Caesar, in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the vanquished Gauls. This word, taken from the Gauls themselves, speaks to the complex nature of cultural exchange and the fluidity of identity. In his writings, Caesar noted the Germans' unwavering ferocity, waging war with the Gauls in almost daily battles. The origins of the name \"German,\" however, remain shrouded in uncertainty, with some positing a connection to the Gaulish language, while others point to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the Germans' reputation for being a loud and boisterous people.\n\nIn his treatise, De Origine et situ Germanorum, Tacitus penned a vivid portrait of the German people, describing them as an aboriginal nation, unblemished by the influx of foreign blood or cultural influence. The Germans, he wrote, were a people of the sea, arriving on the shores of their ancestral land via ships, not land, and defying the allure of more hospitable climes. The Romans, for their part, contented themselves with conquests and trade, their gaze fixed on the riches of Germania, rather than the land itself.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to make their presence felt in the first century, they existed on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their wares and skills, yet forever bound to their own identity. In this liminal space, they forged a nation, tempered by the crucible of history, and shaped by the whispers of a distant past.",
            "The void before me spread out like a bleached canvas, drained of color and vibrancy. My mind wandered listlessly, tracing the contours of the scene before me with a detachment that bordered on numbness. Each thought that arose was a fleeting specter, vanishing as swiftly as it appeared, leaving no residue or echo. My consciousness functioned with a mechanical efficiency, processing the visual data with a precision that belied any personal engagement. It was as if I had been severed from the very fabric of thought, left to drift on a sea of sensory input.\n\nIn a distant corner of my mind, a memory stirred – a conversation with an artist, a sage piece of advice that had long since been filed away. He spoke of a technique, a square frame that could tame the chaos of a scene, reducing it to a manageable, comprehensible whole. I recalled the book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" and the exercises that promised to unlock the secrets of artistic vision. But on this occasion, I was too enthralled, too awestruck by the tableau before me to summon the discipline to impose that frame. The world was too vast, too overwhelming, and I stood frozen, a captive of my own wonder.\n\nIn the realm of art, masters had their own predilections – Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's rainbow-hued masterpieces. If I aspired to join their ranks, to be counted among the makers of beauty and meaning, then perhaps this was my starting point – the genesis of my own artistic vision, my own Work in Brown. My hand twitched, eager to grasp the tool of my craft, but it was not the pencil that would shape my destiny, nor the paintbrush that would bring my vision to life. It was something far more mundane, far more prosaic – a handle, a lever, a tool for the task at hand.\n\nMy fingers closed around it, my muscles tensed, and my hand moved with a jerky, spasmodic motion, as if driven by a will of its own. The offending mass refused to yield, stuck fast like a reluctant mollusk on the bowl's porcelain floor. The mop, a limp and lifeless thing, dangled in my hand, while my tie chafed against my throat, a constant reminder of the constraints that bound me to this thankless task. I stood, frozen, my gaze fixed on the putrid mass before me, as the minutes ticked away, each one a small, incremental step towards my own creative desolation.\n\nThe flush, a soothing balm, seemed to wash away my doubts, and I reached for the sheet, my hand extending, slow and deliberate, like a supplicant seeking absolution. The toilet paper, a meager solace, offered little comfort as I wrapped my fingers around it, transforming it into a makeshift mitten. And then, with a slow, deliberate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a ritualistic act, a concession to the sordid task that lay before me.",
            "In a world shrouded in darkness, a plague ravages the nation's young drivers, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake.  It is a problem as old as the road itself, born of inexperience and a reckless abandon that can only be described as a form of self-immolation.  The National Institutes of Health whisper a truth too terrible to ignore: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to handle the unforgiving dangers of the open road.\n\nIt is not merely a question of numbers, but of essence.  The statistics paint a picture of a generation forsaken to the whims of fate, their inexperience a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the highway.  Speed, recklessness, and the cruel fate of vehicle rollover – all are the hallmarks of a demographic that refuses to be held accountable for its actions.\n\nAnd yet, this is not a problem of individual failing, but of a collective one.  For when teens ride with their peers, the danger multiplies, a deadly calculus that defies all reason.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has seen the correlation, a grim reminder of the perils that await those who drive with the devil's own children by their side.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stem the tide, states have implemented provisional licenses, limiting the hours of driving and prohibiting minors as passengers.  But these measures, though well-intentioned, are nothing more than a stopgap, a palliative that treats the symptoms rather than the disease.  The root of the problem lies deeper, a fundamental issue that speaks to the very essence of adolescence itself.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman has dared to speak the unspoken truth: even the age of 18 is too young for the unforgiving demands of driving.  His research reveals a disturbing desire among the young to court danger for its own sake, a thrall to the sensation that is as old as time itself.  It is a siren's call, beckoning the unwary to the rocks of destruction.\n\nLegislation is the only solution, a straightforward answer to a problem that has been allowed to simmer for far too long.  Schools must continue to teach the fundamentals of driving, but no child under the age of 18 should be allowed to take the wheel.  A provisional permit may still be granted, but with stricter conditions, and a greater emphasis on practical training.  The number of hours required should be standardized, a nationwide measure to ensure that all teens are held to the same standards.\n\nIt is not a novel idea, but a necessary one.  For the sake of the nation's young, we must act, before the death toll reaches catastrophic proportions.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's babies will be hitting the road, and the consequences will be dire.  We owe it to ourselves, to our children, and to the future to take action.  Anything less would be a betrayal of our duty to protect the innocent.",
            "In the musty vaults of the Library of Congress, I chanced upon the Edison films of old. It was a collection of trick films, fourteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. I was drawn to the obscure and the forgotten, the illusions woven within these early reels. My study of these films was a dance with the shadows, a probing of the poetics that governed their creation. And among them, I discovered the evolutionary outliers, the few that dared to break free from the shackles of convention.\n\nThe trick films of the era, it seemed, were bound by the strictures of their time. They were set-bound, confined to the proscenium of a stage, their cameras rooted to a single position. No movement, only stasis. Long shots and medium shots, a static frame that held the world in place. The one shot, one film methodology, an unyielding rule that governed the narrative. But there were whispers of dissent, hints of a new language emerging in the early days of the century.\n\nI noticed that the trick films, despite their artificiality, shared a common trait – their confinement within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera stood steadfast, a sentinel guarding the threshold, never straying to follow the figures or objects within the frame. This composition, born of the theatre and the vaudeville stage, imposed a limitation on the actors' movement, restricting them to a lateral dance, a perpetual side-to-side shuffle. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained still, a faithful witness to the spectacle.\n\nThe proscenium's grip on the films was firm, a hand that guided the gaze of the viewer. Long shots and medium shots dominated the landscape, with close-ups a rare and forbidden fruit. The audience, like the actors, was bound to the middle ground, denied the intimacy of a piercing glance. The theatre's traditions, born of a time when the entire performance was laid bare upon the stage, dictated the visual vocabulary of the trick films.\n\nThe one-shot, one-film rule cast a long shadow over the narrative, limiting the trick films to a few fleeting moments, each a tantalizing glimpse of the impossible. Most were confined to the realm of vaudeville, a brief, shining moment of magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand. Yet, within this strictures, the filmmakers wove a subtle magic, a dance of illusion and deception. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from the early days, revealed itself to be a masterclass in misdirection, a single shot crafted from multiple pieces, each a thread in the tapestry of illusion.\n\nI stood there, surrounded by the ghosts of the past, the Edison films a testament to the early days of cinema. The trick films, with their stilted movements and bound composition, spoke of a time when the art was still finding its voice, its language. And I, a wanderer in the Library of Congress, felt the whispers of that language, the echoes of a world in the making.",
            "In the inclement land of the nascent republic, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a beacon of fervent conviction. His agricultural pursuits and fleeting foray into politics forged a man unyielding in his devotion to the sacred principles of personal freedom and the curbing of government overreach. His agrarian ethos, the bedrock upon which his opinions were founded, guided his discourse on the very fabric of sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary. He saw the fledgling United States as a tabula rasa, untainted by the legacy of colonial rule, a rare opportunity to craft a system of self-governance that would reflect the inherent duality of human nature.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, intertwined and interdependent, each one a vital thread in the tapestry of human existence. He posited that the denial of one right would unravel the entire fabric, leaving the remaining threads tattered and diminished. These rights, he fervently believed, must remain beyond the grasp of the government's grasping hand. The state of nature, he argued, was a realm where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, a dystopian world that civilized society must strive to overcome.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and the evil that resided within humanity. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that government, like its citizens, was a reflection of human virtues and vices. He posited that good principles would safeguard private property, foster agriculture, and temper the excesses of capitalism, while a government founded upon these principles would operate with equity, even in the face of administrations driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was an innate human trait, but one that became pernicious when it spawned sub-societies that preyed upon the many for the benefit of the few.\n\nIn line with his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, a minimalist Federal government with powers explicitly stated and no more. He recognized the dangers of a vast and expensive Federal authority, prone to despotism, but also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter of the United States, a document that encapsulated the essence of a nation comprising sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "The decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project was a stark precipice, a chasm between the fervor of initiation and the slumber of indifference.  The change in seasons, the New England campus shrouded in winter's chill, may have contributed to the ebbing tide of participation, as the familiar cadence of bicycle and foot traffic gave way to the stillness of frozen earth.  The end of the fall semester brought its own set of distractions - the din of final exams, the whirlwind of grade processing - and the commuter log, a small but vital thread in the tapestry of the project, may have been lost in the tumult.  The holiday season, a time of festive abandon, brought a lull in activity, a pause in the regular rhythms of the semester, and the promise of a month-long respite from the demands of academia.  Yet, it was not until the spring semester resumed, like a phoenix from the ashes, that the project began to stir once more.\n\nBut the decline persisted, a stubborn and unyielding force, and it seemed as though the project itself was a flame flickering in the wind, struggling to stay alight.  The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate bid to rekindle the spark, did bring a brief surge in log submissions, a fleeting respite from the winter's chill, but it was not enough to sustain the momentum, and the numbers continued to dwindle.  It was as though the project was a traveler, caught in the midst of a long and dusty road, where the horizon seemed to stretch out before him like an endless expanse of gray.\n\nAnd so, we were left to ponder the nature of participation, to probe the depths of human psychology, and to consider the allure of the automobile, that great and seductive siren of modern life.  For in the end, it is the freedom, the independence, and the flexibility of the car that prove so alluring, a siren's call that is deeply ingrained in our culture.  The prizes we offered, tokens of our appreciation and our desire to encourage alternative modes of commuting, may have been insufficient, mere trinkets in the grand tapestry of human desire.  But what if we had offered something more, something greater, a shining jewel on the horizon of possibility?  Would it have been enough to stir the hearts of our participants, to rouse them from their slumber and to rekindle the flame of engagement?\n\nWe may never know, but it is a question that haunts us still, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of renewal, of rebirth, and of a new beginning.  And so, we press on, driven by the faint hope that one day, we may find the key to unlocking the secrets of human participation, and that our project may emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In a realm where the instruments of commerce reign supreme, a breed of security emerged, a creature born of innovation and flexibility. The exchange traded fund, or ETF, a chameleon of sorts, donned the guise of a stock, yet possessed the diversification of its index fund brethren. It strode across the exchanges, a flexible and versatile entity, allowing the freedom to buy on margin, sell short, and acquire a single share with each transaction. Though its allure was great, a shadowy presence lurked in the form of expense ratios, lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a specter of commissions haunted each trade. The ETF's panoply of available funds was a veritable tapestry, woven from the threads of diversity.\n\nYet, like all things, the ETF held its pitfalls. A cost to be reckoned with, a commission that accompanied each transaction, like a specter haunting the steps of the prudent investor. It was a prudent exercise, then, for the discerning investor to evaluate the benefits touted by the ETF, to unravel the threads of diversification, and to gauge their extent. The ETF IHF, a creature of fascination, would be our quarry, its top 10 holdings to be scrutinized, compared against the top 10 holdings that comprised the ETF, to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF could rival those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. Would the ETF's promise of diversification hold true, or would there exist a configuration of the same stocks, a hidden pattern, that would yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nIn our pursuit of understanding, we have chosen to concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which accounted for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The numbers below reveal the top 10 holdings, their percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF IHF as a whole, we employed a method of normalization, assigning a value of 100% to the total assets, and then calculating the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio be comprised entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion established by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it becomes apparent that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings was .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. At first glance, it seemed that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might provide a higher return with a lower Beta. Yet, the question remained: were these two portfolios statistically different?\n\nTo answer this, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results would reveal whether the differences between the two portfolios were significant, or mere whispers of chance.",
            "In the hollowed halls of literature, where the shadows dance with the whispers of the past, there exists a place of eerie silence, a Dream-Land forged by the masterful hand of Edgar Allan Poe. It is a realm where the boundaries of reality are blurred, where the living and the dead converge, and where the darkness reigns supreme. Here, in this forsaken land, Poe's words bleed into the poetry of another, a Thulé born from the imagination of Goethe, a siren's call to the unknown.\n\nThe echoes of Thulé resound through Poe's \"Dream-Land\", a poem that weaves a tapestry of sorrow, loss, and the eternal longing for a world that has passed. The term \"Thulé\" itself, like a phantom, haunts the lines of the poem, a whispered secret from the depths of the past. Virgil's ancient voice is said to have first uttered this enigmatic word, but it is in Goethe's \"Faust\" that we find its true resonance.\n\nIn the poetic drama of \"Faust\", a tale of love, loss, and damnation, Goethe's King of Thulé stands as a haunting figure, a monarch consumed by grief and despair. His story is one of a king who, bereft of his queen, succumbs to the darkness, his heart heavy with the weight of memories. This is a king who, like the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", is lost in a world devoid of color, a world shrouded in the shadows of the unknown.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, a testament to Poe's mastery of the poetic art. The former is a poem of sorrow, a dirge for a lost love, while the latter is a lament for the very fabric of reality itself. Both are companion pieces, each speaking to the other in a language that is both familiar and yet, utterly alien.\n\nPoe's debt to Goethe is evident in his use of the term Thulé, a nod to the German author's influence on his work. The echoes of Goethe's \"Faust\" can be heard in the dark, haunting landscapes of \"Dream-Land\", where the speaker wanders, lost and alone, haunted by the ghosts of the past. This is a world without color, a world where the light of hope has faded, leaving only the cold, dark shadows of despair.\n\nIn the vast expanse of literary history, Goethe stands as a towering figure, a master of the poetic art. Poe, in his turn, was drawn to the vortex of Goethe's imagination, a siren's call that beckoned him to explore the depths of the human experience. The connection between the two authors is a testament to the power of literature to transcend time and space, to speak to the universal human condition.\n\nIn the words of Poe himself, we find a nod to the enduring legacy of Goethe, a legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of our time. For in the world of literature, there are few greater than the debt we owe to those who have come before us, who have walked the paths of the past, and who have left behind a trail of words that continue to guide us on our own journey through the shadows of the unknown.",
            "Under the cold light of California's laws, a customer who falls prey to an applesauce spill in a grocery store's hallowed halls, yet succeeds in extracting punitive damages from the establishment, might find solace in the knowledge that the store's manager had flouted the warning signs of impending doom. The store's manager, Paul Martin, had been twice informed of the spill's presence – once by Rich Wayne, an employee whose words fell on deaf ears, and again by Mary J. Haddigan, another employee whose pleas for action were similarly ignored. Martin, ensconced in the comfort of his dinner, had chosen to turn a blind eye to the danger that lurked beneath his feet. This deliberate disregard for the well-being of his customers would prove to be a fatal error, one that would leave Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, with a claim for punitive damages that would not be easily dismissed.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a stark picture of negligence and malice. Five slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months preceding Palmer's accident, yet Martin failed to take any meaningful action to address the issue. His cavalier attitude towards customer safety, exemplified by his flippant dismissal of customer complaints, would ultimately prove to be his downfall. The law is clear: in California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Martin's actions, far from being innocent oversights, demonstrate a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of his customers.\n\nThe California courts have long recognized that malice can be inferred when a defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). In this case, Martin's actions demonstrate a callous disregard for the safety of his customers, and a willful failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The question now before the court is whether this conduct rises to the level of despicable, and whether Martin's actions were committed with the requisite level of malice to warrant an award of punitive damages.",
            "Four years past I wrestled with the weight of Islam in a course at CBC.  A contentious subject of discussion was whether the faith itself was a harbinger of hostility.  I found that the question burned brighter with the passage of time, fueled by the embers of 9/11.  As the media's narrative shifted, a yawning chasm opened between the portrayal of Islam as a monolith of terror and its increasingly saccharine depiction in the American landscape.  It seemed inconceivable that just two decades prior, a presidential candidate with a Muslim family background would have been deemed unthinkable.  The concept of Barack Obama, a man whose name became synonymous with hope, would have been anathema in that dark time.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet holds a certain fascination for me, a narrative that seems to defy the historical record.  From what I had previously understood, Muhammad was a figure who compelled conversions through conquest and coercion.  Yet, the biography portrays a man of unassuming nature, a martyr whose humility and compassion drew followers to his cause.  As I delved deeper, I found the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad to be striking.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a feat that rivaled the wonders of the New Testament, seemed designed to underscore Muhammad's character as a humble prophet, unencumbered by the need for proof or validation.\n\nBut this narrative struck me as a deliberate attempt to subvert the truth, to supplant the life and teachings of Jesus with a watered-down, sanitized version of Muhammad's story.  It was as if the writers sought to pilfer the essence of Christ's message and rebrand it as their own, a travesty that diminished the very fabric of the faith.  Furthermore, the reliance on third-hand accounts and hearsay only served to erode the credibility of the narrative, casting a veil of doubt over the entire enterprise.\n\nWhat unsettled me most, however, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  History, however, paints a different picture, one of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power.  I couldn't help but wonder if the true nature of Muhammad's rise to power was known to the Muslim faithful, or if they were complicit in the myth-making that had been spun around his legacy.",
            "The shadows of the Son of God were cast early upon the soul of Christianity, a faint outline of a figure whose teachings were lost in the labyrinthine corridors of time. As the years crept forward like a thief in the night, the true essence of the faith was shrouded in the mists of doctrine and dogma. The spinning of the theological clock, a maddening whirl of dogmatic fires, left the flame of the original message to flicker and die in the cold darkness of forgotten truths. \n\nYet, like the first faint light of dawn, a glimmer of awareness began to stir in the hearts of men. The orthodox, a bastion of tradition, stood rigid and unyielding, their grip on the past unyielding as the unyielding rock of a tormented sea. But the tide of progress, an unstoppable force, surged forward, gathering momentum as it rolled, an energized tsunami that threatened to sweep away the cobwebs of centuries. The voices of dissent, a whispered litany, grew louder, a cacophony of reason and curiosity that pierced the darkness like a shaft of sunlight.\n\nAnd so, the great reversal began, a movement of the heart, a yearning to reclaim the lost, to rediscover the fire that had once burned so brightly. It was a process of unwinding, a stripping away of the accretions that had accumulated over the centuries, a peeling back of the layers of dogma to reveal the unadorned truth. It would be a journey of centuries, a slow and painful process, but one that would ultimately lead to a return to the source, a reclamation of the original intent of the faith.\n\nAs the great reversion gathered pace, the landscape of Christianity was transformed. The diversity of interpretation, a chaotic tapestry of conflicting views, began to weave itself into a single, cohesive thread. The differences that had once seemed insurmountable, the divisions that had rent the fabric of the faith, began to fade away, until, like a great river finding its source, the waters of the soul were clarified, their essence distilled to its purest form.\n\nThis was not a return to the past, but a rediscovery of the future, a reclaiming of the fire that had been lost. It was a journey back to the source, a return to the wellspring of the faith, where the waters of the soul were clear and unadulterated. And when the great reversion was complete, the church, that great institution, would stand strong, a beacon of guidance, a leader on the path to enlightenment.\n\nBut what had occurred over the centuries since the lifetime of Jesus? The seeds of Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity, had been sown in the fertile soil of the Hebrew scriptures. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, had been the bedrock of the faith. Yet, the Jewish population had been rent asunder by division, a fractured community of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk, each with their own unique perspective on the faith.",
            "The Jungle, a tale of a world consumed by its own baser impulses, reveals to us the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. Like a diseased organism, it festers with greed and self-interest, its every fibre straining towards self-preservation above all else. The plutocrats, those masters of the great factories, care not for the well-being of their workers, nor for the world around them, as long as their coffers swell and their power grows. Theirs is a world of smoke and ash, where the great chimneys belch forth their noxious fumes, and the once-pristine waters run thick with the effluent of their neglect.\n\nAs we are drawn into the depths of Packingtown, we find a place where humanity has been reduced to nothing more than a commodity. The workers, toiling in the factories, are nothing more than beasts of burden, their lives reduced to a mere means to an end. The owners and managers, their hearts black as the coal they burn, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor for the suffering they inflict. They are driven by a singular purpose: to accumulate wealth and power, no matter the cost. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This is a world without mercy, a world where the strong prey upon the weak.\n\nAnd yet, it is not just the owners and managers who are to blame. The system itself is corrupt, a cancer that infects every aspect of life. The workers, desperate to survive, are forced to endure conditions that would be unimaginable to us today. They toil for long hours, for pitiful wages, and are cast aside like so much trash when they are no longer useful. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for redress, often prove to be little more than a mockery, preying upon the very people they claim to represent. Thus, we are left with a population that is little more than a mere shadow of humanity, a population that is as helpless as a slave.\n\nIn this bleak world, immorality reigns supreme. The workers, conditioned to survive in a system that offers them no quarter, are left to their own devices. They are forced to eke out a meager existence, dependent on the whims of their oppressors. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a grim testament to the darkest aspects of human nature, and a reminder that, even in the most desperate of times, there is no escape from the abyss that lies at the heart of our own nature.",
            "Many authors employ varied techniques to elicit a particular sentiment or disposition in their readers, some more efficacious than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of this art, as exemplified in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often pairs disparate adjectives with nouns to conjure a certain ambiance around a subject, imbuing them with a significance that is at once palpable and intangible. Another technique he employs is to assign meaning to symbols, only to later utilize them for a similar purpose. This method is particularly evident in his use of colors, specifically the dichotomy of white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a semantic landscape for these colors, only to utilize them as a harbinger for a particular feeling or reminder around a subject of importance.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of white/gray is particularly noteworthy, as he imbues these colors with a sense of uniformity, with white being synonymous with refinement and elegance, and gray with the patina of age and decay. Initially, he establishes this dichotomy by peppering the novel with instances of both colors, often in tandem. Daisy and Jordan are incessantly clad in white, a ubiquitous presence that extends to the rest of the novel's characters, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's soiree to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time this uniformity is interrupted is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). This juxtaposition serves to further reinforce the notion that white and gray are inextricably linked.\n\nFitzgerald also extends this semantic reach by applying these colors to everyday, mundane objects, thereby underscoring their ubiquity. As Nick traverses the city, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable are rendered as \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity that Fitzgerald seeks to convey. Even common individuals and places are frequently described in terms of these colors: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), while the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving thus established a semantic foundation for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. This is first evident in Daisy's characterization. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), thereby reducing her to a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further exemplified in her subsequent appearances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "A desolate fertility lay in wait in San Diego County, its soil yearning to be tilled by the patient hands of a farmer. The land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, stood as a testament to the unforgiving beauty of nature. Adjoining the town of Potrero, in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, this land held secrets of the past, its soil scarred by the hands of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who had once called this place home. The weight of this history hung heavy, like the stillness of the chaparral's February mornings.\n\nAs the seasons unfolded, a verdant tapestry of life would bloom: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers would burst forth, their colors and scents a testament to the land's untapped potential. A niche market beckoned, and the prospect of organic community supported agriculture lured many to the area, their waiting lists a testament to the hunger for this wholesome, earthy beauty. The allure of organic eggs and milk, too, drew in the faithful, their taste buds awakened by the promise of untainted purity.\n\nYet, the path to this bounty was fraught with challenges, the delicate balance between profit and preservation a tightrope to walk. The organic farm, a beacon of sustainability, stood as a shining example of the difficulties faced by those who sought to coax life from this unforgiving earth. Intensive labor and management were required, as the farmer's hands wrestled with pests, weeds, and the capricious whims of the soil. Losses were inevitable, and the small-scale operation's lack of efficiency stood in stark contrast to the grandeur of large-scale conventional farming.\n\nIn this crucible, the landowner found themselves torn between the siren song of profit and the seraphic whispers of the land itself. The property, once the domain of Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, now stood as a testament to the fragile dance between humanity and the natural world. The Cleveland National Forest, a sentinel to the north, watched over this fragile balance, its ancient wisdom a reminder of the delicate harmony that existed between the creatures of this land and the land itself.\n\nIn this uncertain landscape, the landowner found themselves searching for a guiding light, a beacon to illuminate the path ahead. Government programs, a lifeline in these uncertain times, offered a glimmer of hope, a means to mitigate the costs and preserve the beauty of this land. But the choices were many, and the road ahead, treacherous. The land, a patient teacher, waited for the farmer's hands to guide it, to coax forth the beauty that lay hidden beneath the surface. The future, a tapestry of promise and peril, beckoned, and the landowner stood at the crossroads, poised to make a choice that would shape the destiny of this 160-acre parcel, and the creatures that called it home.",
            "In the vast expanse of human interaction, cultural nuances hold sway like wisps of smoke that cling to the landscape. Culture, a tapestry woven from the threads of what we are not, as much as what we are, defies a singular definition. It is a labyrinthine entity, its contours shifting like the sands of time. Reducing an entire culture to a single trait - like assigning the label \"stubborn\" to all Russians or \"accommodating\" to all Japanese - is an exercise in futility, a crude approximation of the intricate patterns that underlie the human experience.\n\nAs one navigates the uncharted waters of foreign culture, the tendency to draw comparisons to one's own is a pitfall waiting to befall. The negotiator, seeking to understand the currents of a culture, must delve into its depths, tracing the contours of its history, its prejudices, and its values. It is not a matter of judging or altering the culture, but of acknowledging its inherent complexities and working within its bounds, especially when the stakes are high, and the bargaining position is precarious.\n\nCulture's reach extends far beyond the borders of nations; it permeates the very fabric of organizations, giving rise to corporate cultures that are as varied as the individuals within them. A company's values, evident in its dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices, can be as mercurial as the wind, shifting from one office to the next, from one region to the next. The American corporate landscape, with its diverse array of company cultures, is a testament to the fluidity of cultural expression.\n\nBut it is the values that underlie a culture that hold the key to understanding its very essence. Values, the bedrock of a culture, dictate the motivations, the priorities, and the very manner in which individuals interact with one another. In a culture where saving face or communal harmony is paramount, the negotiator must tread carefully, lest they inadvertently tread on sensitive ground. Conversely, in a culture where a hard-driven bargain is the hallmark, the negotiator must be prepared to adapt, lest they be left behind in the dust.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural differences, the negotiator must be willing to listen, to learn, and to adapt. By taking the time to understand the opponent on a personal level, they can tailor their approach, like a skilled navigator charting a course through uncharted waters. It is a delicate dance, one that requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of human culture, and a willingness to navigate the complexities that lie beneath the surface.",
            "It was said in the hollow of a man's chest, \"There is no God.\" A phrase oft repeated, a mantra of the forsaken and the lost. It originated in the pages of the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14, and was later taken up by St. Anselm as a cornerstone of his argument for the existence of the divine. Thomas Aquinas followed suit, his own reasoning a tapestry woven from threads of logic and reason. But what of these two proponents of the divine? Which of their arguments holds sway? To approach this question, we must first assume that both men speak of the same God - the God of the Bible, with all its attendant trappings and characteristics. To do otherwise would be to muddy the waters, to turn a straightforward comparison into a muddled morass.\n\nAnd so we begin with the assumption that both men speak of this God, and that their arguments are in defense of a singular, biblical concept. It is with this understanding that we examine the reasoning of St. Anselm. His argument hinges on the notion that the existence of God is inextricably tied to our own understanding of the divine. God, he posits, is that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. We need not look beyond the confines of our own souls to find proof of God's existence. This, of course, is a concept deeply rooted in the idea of faith - that which we cannot see, yet know to be true nonetheless. It is a notion that speaks to the very heart of the human condition.\n\nBut St. Thomas Aquinas takes a different tack. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, a notion that speaks to the rational, logical mind. This is an argument that would serve the evangelist well, for it would allow the spreading of the Gospel without the need for blind faith. And so Aquinas presents five logical arguments in favor of God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each, he posits, speaks to the necessity of God's existence. If a puzzle were incomplete, we could deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece through logic alone, without ever having seen it.\n\nIn the end, both men present valid arguments, yet neither fully captures the complexity of the human experience. Their arguments, while instructive, fail to account for the messy, multifaceted nature of human understanding. We are, after all, creatures of both reason and emotion, of logic and faith. We are torn between the desire for empirical evidence and the whispered promises of the soul. And so, we are left to navigate the twilight realm between the two, where truth and faith entwine like the branches of a withered tree.",
            "In the dim recesses of ancient time, a prince would stir, destined to be known as the Buddha. His life would unfold like a river, its waters dark and unfathomable, until he cast off the tethers of the world and beheld the radiant truth. His teachings would spread like a wildfire, igniting the flame of Buddhism, a fire that would burn for millennia. Yet, like the shifting sands of a desert, its form would change, its essence succumbing to the capricious winds of time. The Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, a bastion of orthodoxy, would hold fast to its traditions, even as the Buddha's teachings had never spoken of such festivities as the annual water-cutting ceremony. And so, the differences would accumulate, like the delicate layers of a pearl, from the mundane customs to the very core of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, would be forced to adapt, their doctrines evolving like the silken threads of a spider's web.\n\nIn this tapestry of change, two threads would weave together – the internal and the external. Internal forces would arise from within the community, while external forces would come from without, their intentions either hostile or benign. The distinction would be crucial, for the fate of the Buddhist community hung in the balance.\n\nTo navigate this complex landscape, one must first understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core lies the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a luminous entity, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the sacred teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka reveals the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. Anatta, the negation of the self, Dukkha, the inherent suffering of existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things, would be the bedrock upon which the edifice of enlightenment was built. Only by grasping these concepts could one shatter the cycle of Sansara, the wheel of birth and death, and free themselves from the fetters of lobha, dosa, and moha.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, would outline the rules for laymen and monks alike. For the former, five precepts would be the guiding light: abstain from taking life, lying, theft, sensual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the latter, a multitude of disciplinary rules would govern their lives. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth of suffering; the origin of suffering, attachment; the cessation of suffering, a state of liberation; and the path leading to the cessation of suffering. Like a mighty river, these truths would flow through the centuries, shaping the destiny of the Theravada community, their waters ever-changing, yet remaining steadfast in their essence.",
            "The United States and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, had been locked in a bitter rivalry that stretched for nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893. The animosity between them had been a slow-burning fire, fueled by divergent values and irreconcilable interests. The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a brutal conflict that left its scars, marked the apogee of this rivalry, as the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. But the enmity between the two nations did not subside with the war's end; rather, it simmered, periodically erupting into violent clashes and disputes over territory, culture, and tradition.\n\nThe rivalries that beset the United States and Mexico were not unique; many nations sharing a border have been rent asunder by similar tensions. The vicissitudes of history and geography had forged a bond between the two nations, a bond that, like a festering wound, refused to heal. As David M. Pletcher noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States had created a web of entanglements, a knot that would not untie easily.\n\nThe gulf between the United States and Mexico was, in part, a product of the deep-seated distrust that had been inherited from their respective colonial pasts. The English and Spanish, the former colonizers of both nations, had left behind a legacy of animosity, a residue that would take generations to dissipate. This mutual distrust had given rise to a series of disputes, both great and small, that would etch themselves into the annals of history. Sally Frahm observed that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). In the rivalry between the United States and Mexico, this ideological chasm had been exacerbated by the competing interests of the two nations, each vying for dominance on the continent.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 discrete disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry, the majority of which revolved around territorial issues. Border raids, banditry, and outlaws had long plagued the frontier, a problem that would require the application of military force to resolve. Schmitt (1974) noted that it was only when Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States that the rivalry began to slowly abate, its flames finally extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the later years of the 19th century.",
            "Darkness crept in, a slow and insidious thing, seeping into the marrow of his bones fifteen years past. A sickness he had never known before, a thief that stole his livelihood and left him broken and alone. He was a nurse, a healer of others, yet he found himself unable to heal himself. The mantra of his youth, a hollow promise of security, now taunted him with its emptiness: \"You'll always find work, people will always get sick.\" The words echoed through his mind like a dirge, a reminder of all he had lost.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of his own making, he wandered, a man without a purpose. Forty-six years old, with nothing to his name but the fragile thread of Social Security Disability. The days blurred together in a never-ending struggle, a fight for survival in a world that seemed determined to crush him. Yet, amidst the ruin, he found solace in the love of his family and a handful of loyal friends. They were the anchor that held him fast, the lifeline that kept him from being swept away by the torrent of despair.\n\nHe knew that life is a fragile thing, a delicate balance of events that can tip at any moment into chaos. Emergencies come without warning, their arrival swift and merciless. And when they do, we are forced to confront the limits of our own strength. We are reminded that no matter how well we prepare, there are some challenges that cannot be overcome alone.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of conservatives, is a thin veil that conceals the truth. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains did not make their journey alone; they were bound together by a shared sense of purpose and a reliance on one another. They knew that in times of hardship, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the community that stands together.\n\nHe, too, had prepared for the worst. His disaster kit was stocked, his first aid supplies ready, his water purifying tablets at the ready. He had flashlights, candles, and waterproof matches, a pantry filled with canned goods and a small store of seeds for a garden. But he knew that true strength lies not in the tools we gather, but in the bonds we forge with others. And so, he did what he could to build a community, to create a network of support that would see him through the darkest of times.\n\nHe knew his neighbors, and they knew him. They checked in on him, offered what little they could, and he did the same for them. They were a threadbare patchwork quilt, stitched together by the love and the need to survive. And in this fragile tapestry, he found a sense of purpose, a reason to keep going when all seemed lost.\n\nThe Conservatives may speak of rugged individualism, but he knew the truth: that it is in our shared humanity, our compassion, and our mutual support that we find the strength to face the unknown. And so, he would continue to build his community, to nurture the relationships that sustained him, and to remember that in the end, it is not the individual who stands alone, but the collective that stands strong.",
            "In the barren expanse of time, the question persists: why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there unseen constraints that guide the trajectory of change, or is it a meandering path without rhyme or reason? Even the venerable D'Arcy Thompson, in his prescient words of 1917, acknowledged that the zoologist had yet to grasp the essence of organic forms, to pin them down in the cold, unforgiving language of mathematics. And yet, nearly a century later, the same enigma remains. The application of mathematical modeling to the growth and evolution of mollusk shells, a field pioneered by Raup and Stanley in 1981, offers a glimmer of hope in this darkness. Our own study seeks to unravel the mysteries of Prunum's skeletal development, by combining mathematical modeling with the rigors of experimental research.\n\nWe began by subjecting X-radiographic images of Prunum species to a careful analysis, distilling them into quantitative parameters that could be fed into the software program CerioShell, devised by Stone in 1995. These parameters, like the threads of a tapestry, were woven into a tapestry of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. The results, a testament to the power of mathematical abstraction, have shed new light on the boundaries of possible change in this ancient lineage.\n\nConsider the shell, that most curious of structures, a tube that traverses the passage of time, a spiral path etched across the fabric of space. The revolutions of the shell, its whorls, are like the pages of a book, each one a chapter in the story of the mollusk's growth. The columella, a central axis, runs through the heart of the shell, a thread that stitches together the disparate parts. The suture, a line that separates each whorl, is like a seam that binds the fabric of the shell, a testament to the mollusk's ceaseless striving to build and adapt.\n\nThe shell, a labyrinthine structure, presents itself to us in various guises: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, with the opening facing us, is like a doorway to the mysteries within. The shell's apex, the tip of the spire, is a pinnacle of form, a point of no return, while the base, the opposite end, is a reminder of the mollusk's humble beginnings.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must first view the shell from the apical angle, then draw a line that divides the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl, a precision that belies the shell's organic, living essence. The trajectory of the aperture, a path that winds through time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a dance of coordinates and radii that charts the shell's growth.\n\nAnd so, by varying the parameters, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, a digital alchemy that transmutes the raw materials of growth into the finished form of the shell. The possibilities are endless, a labyrinth of possibilities that stretches out before us like the shell's own spiral path.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Indonesia's health statistics, a steadfast truth remains: the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have stalled for ten arduous years. Like a stagnant lake, the country's progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals hangs precariously in the balance. While the waters of progress lap gently against the shores of water and sanitation targets, the tides of child and maternal health remain mired in stagnation. The reasons for this morass are manifold, a tangled web of complexities that necessitate a reevaluation of the country's health system, rather than a piecemeal approach to programmatic interventions.\n\nA meager 72% of births in Indonesia are now attended by skilled health workers, a figure that belies the stark reality of the traditional workers – midwives – who stand powerless to intervene in the face of complications. The maternal deaths that follow, a heavy toll of hemorrhage, serve as a stark reminder of the limitations of this statistic. Meanwhile, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has taken a precipitous decline, a dismal trend that underscores the need for urgent attention. The data on postnatal care is as incomplete as the dark recesses of a forgotten cave, but one thing is clear: the rates are appallingly low, a testament to the country's stubborn neglect of this critical area.\n\nThe cesarian-section rate, a mere 4%, is a stark indictment of the country's healthcare infrastructure. The chasm between urban and rural areas, a 5% difference, is a canyon of inequity, a reminder that access to healthcare services is a luxury reserved for the privileged few. The vertical equity gap, a yawning 27% chasm, highlights the woeful truth that out-of-pocket costs have become an insurmountable barrier for the poor, condemning them to a life of substandard care.\n\nAs Indonesia navigates the treacherous waters of healthcare reform, the question of how to address the dearth of services looms large. Should the country chart a course of program-specific approaches, or should it focus on strengthening the overall health system, eschewing the narrow focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? The allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and rapid results, is undeniable. However, the drawbacks are as numerous as the stars in a midnight sky. The diversion of resources to a single area, the clustering of human resources in areas of greater financing, and the duplication of services, all serve to create a maelstrom of inefficiency and waste.",
            "In the twilight of the era, novels of the Victorian persuasion were beset by an undue fondness for minute particulars and an unwavering fixation on the nobility of the time. However, two works that diverged from this mold were Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These narratives deftly wove an aura of mystery and an air of the inexplicable, a departure from the conventions of their era, thus imbuing their protagonists with a depth of character that laid bare their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Fagin's world unraveled, Oliver's mind was beset by a maelstrom of disjointed thoughts. The words of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a cacophony in his mind, still lingered in his ears. The world around him dissolved into chaos as the sound of gunfire rent the air, and he felt himself being swept up by an unseen force. The turmoil of his surroundings was a mere backdrop to the gnawing pain that dogged him, a constant reminder of the fragility of life.\n\nThe employment of mystery in these novels often manifested through the device of dreamlike states or visions, though the content and purpose of these episodes varied between the two works. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic happenings served to illuminate the depths of Oliver's inner world, revealing his anguish and his nascent understanding of the true nature of his circumstances. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28, where Oliver relives the event in vivid detail, serves to underscore the powerlessness that had come to define his existence. His senses numbed, he was helplessly borne away by an unseen force, his pain now a constant, gnawing companion that had supplanted the initial shock of fear. This sequence of events serves to underscore the notion that Oliver's fate was not his own to control, but rather the result of forces beyond his comprehension. The protagonist's growing sense of defeat is also palpable, as if Fagin's influence had sapped his will, leaving him a hollow shell of his former self, devoid of the capacity to resist his circumstances.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the passage of time is similarly distorted, as if the very fabric of reality had been rent asunder. The day, a fleeting entity, was already gone, lost in the darkness of night, which, in turn, was both interminable and ephemeral, its silence oppressive, its hours ticking away with all the urgency of a countdown to oblivion.",
            "A couple of years ago, I found myself lost in the depths of an after-school program, surrounded by the faint scent of desperation and the gnawing hunger of students struggling to find their place in the labyrinth of learning. It was there that I took on the task of tutoring elementary-aged students, attempting to guide them through the hallways of English and reading. My feeble attempts at assistance were met with varying degrees of success, but one boy in particular, Adrian, seemed to confound me. His eyes, like dark pools of water, reflected a world both familiar and alien, as if the very fabric of language had been torn asunder, leaving him lost and adrift.\n\nHis precise pronunciation of certain letters, like a cadence of rain on steel, seemed at odds with his inability to grasp the rest. It was as if the alphabet had been laid out before him like a cryptic map, its meaning shrouded in mist. I was drawn to him, a moth to the flame of understanding, and together we navigated the twisted paths of language. But it wasn't until I met his mother, a woman with skin as dark as the earth and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world, that the truth began to seep into my consciousness like a slow-moving tide.\n\nHer words, like the rustle of dry leaves, were a language I struggled to decipher, a dialect that spoke of a world beyond the confines of my understanding. And yet, in that moment, I grasped the truth: Adrian's struggles were not with reading itself, but with the alphabet, a puzzle he had yet to assemble. I wondered if this revelation had brought him solace, or if the weight of his struggles still bore down upon him like a physical presence.\n\nI share this tale for one reason: to confront the specter of the language barrier that haunts our schools, particularly in California's storied landscape. It is a monster that lurks in the shadows, its presence felt but rarely seen. I tell it to challenge the notion that the problem is as simple as it seems, that even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of reading.\n\nWe must recognize that the solution is not a simple one. The dual language system, a notion both elegant and flawed, holds promise but also raises its own set of challenges. Can we require all teachers to be bilingual? The notion seems as absurd as the thought of a tree growing in the desert. No, but what if we were to surround our students with bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we choose to call them? Would that not be a step in the right direction?\n\nThe statistics speak of the benefits of two-way bilingual education programs: children who participate in these programs outperform their peers academically. But the fear persists, a specter that haunts our collective conscience. We fear the waste of resources, the notion that the majority will reap no benefit. But what if we were to invert this thinking, to see the value not in the individual but in the collective? What if we were to adopt this approach as the rule, rather than the exception?\n\nIn this unforgiving landscape of learning, we must find a way to bridge the chasm between language and understanding. It is a task that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the complexities of a world that is as much a puzzle as it is a canvas. I offer no easy answers, only the whispered promise of a solution that lies in the intersection of language and understanding.",
            "From the moment we are small, we are told of a world beyond our own, a world that dwarfs our comprehension. Some are shepherded to Sunday school, others to Temple, and still others are left to wander in search of answers within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many of us cling to the faith imparted by our forebears, while others reject it outright, skeptical of the notion that there is anything beyond the narrow confines of our own existence. We weave a tapestry of values, ever shifting, ever adapting, our understanding of the cosmos oscillating between certainty and doubt.\n\n\"My favorite bird,\" my father said, his voice a low murmur, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless cadence on the tin roof above us. The gutters groaned, releasing a deluge of water that drowned the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes lost in thought, a faraway look that was both searching and remembering. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging limply from his bones, his hair thinning, his eyes sunken. I felt a shroud of fear and solitude settle over me, unable to broach the subject of his impending departure, for to speak of it would only make it more real, more unbearable. I wrapped my arms around him, pulled back, and joined him in his vigil, lost in the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father passed into the void in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but to what end, I couldn't fathom. What kind of god would exact this toll? I thought to myself, alone in the darkness. I offered no prayers, for if a god existed, it had long since ceased to listen. I had chosen not to witness his passing, to spare myself the agony of watching life ebb from his frame. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not have wanted me to bear witness to his final moments. I curled into a ball, hiding in the darkness, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one came to break the silence.",
            "In the twilight of understanding, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, a marriage of the ancient and the modern, a dissonant harmony of old and new. As Ian Watt astutely observed, this genre is an oxymoron, a union of disparate elements that defies categorization. The Gothic mode has been disparaged for its perceived lack of depth, yet lauded for its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The earliest exemplar of this genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of medieval romance and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary tapestry.\n\nWalpole's use of \"old\" theatrical elements and \"new\" naturalistic descriptions served as a deliberate contrivance, a calculated blend of the archaic and the modern. He dubbed this innovative approach \"A Gothic Story,\" a notion that would come to define a genre that would be both nostalgic and avant-garde (Walpole 4). The Gothic tradition drew upon the dramatic conventions of medieval theatre, the grandeur of Gothic architecture, and the mystique of medieval chivalry, yet it also spoke to the anxieties of a modernizing world.\n\nIn an era where the term \"Gothic\" was applied to a range of peoples, styles, and epochs, it was often seen as a relic of a bygone era, a quaint anachronism in the face of progress. The Gothic novel, however, managed to transcend this perception by embracing the tension between the old and the new, the theatrical and the naturalistic. This dichotomy allowed the genre to endure, to remain both outdated and fresh to readers across the ages.\n\nOne of the most enduring hallmarks of the Gothic mode is its fascination with chivalry, that medieval ideal of the noble knight. The chivalric code, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, served as a benchmark against which the corruption and decay of modern society could be measured. Writers like Walpole, who were disillusioned with the social and political currents of their time, saw in chivalry a lost ideal, a golden age of morality and virtue that had been supplanted by the cynicism and pragmatism of the modern world.\n\nIn The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a bygone era is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies the chivalric ideals of his forebears. His description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery: he is a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight, his very existence a testament to the lingering presence of a bygone era (66). This excess of chivalric traits serves as a foil to the decay and corruption that pervades the modern world, highlighting the tension between the ideal and the actual, the old and the new.\n\nThus, the Gothic Novel stands as a testament to the power of nostalgia, a genre that speaks to the anxieties and longings of a bygone era. In its exploration of the chivalric ideal, it reveals a profound ambivalence towards the modern world, a world that is seen as both corrupt and fascinating. The Gothic Novel remains a testament to the enduring power of the human imagination, a genre that continues to captivate and inspire readers to this day.",
            "In the desolate landscape of commerce, a lone stream winds its way, a labyrinthine process of goods in transit, from the customer's cry for want to the raw materials that lay the foundation for the entire edifice. This was the concept of supply chain management, born in 1982 by the visionary Keith Oliver, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of planning and control. He beheld the entire process, a grand tapestry of threads that wove together to satisfy the needs of the customer in a dance of efficiency and speed.\n\nSix essential strands comprise this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The managers of commerce, they who navigate these waters, employ these six threads to weave a cloak of satisfaction for their customers. For in the production stage, the very first strand, lies the foundation of the entire edifice. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined. The managers must listen to the whispers of the market, that great indicator of the customer's desires. And once they have grasped the market's pulse, they may decide upon the products to be created, and in what quantity.\n\nBut production is a thread that is easily tangled. For every detail, every stitch, is crucial to the entirety. A single misstep can unravel the entire fabric, costing the company dearly in time and money. I recall the precise protocols of Wal-Mart and Target, two behemoths of commerce, where every aspect of the business was mapped out with precision. From the uniform of the employee to the reception of shipments, every step was choreographed to ensure a smooth and efficient dance.\n\nAnd so we come to the second strand, supply. This is the domain of strategic decisions, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined, and partnerships are forged. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its ownequipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is best suited to the product's processes. And perhaps, to further streamline the process, the work may be outsourced to other companies. This is the concept of velocity, the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nBut the question remains, what is the ultimate goal of this grand tapestry? Is it not to satisfy the customer, to provide a product that meets their needs in a swift and efficient manner? The managers of commerce, they who weave this tapestry, must ever be mindful of this goal, lest the threads become tangled, and the entire edifice crumbles.",
            "He stood in the ruins, his eyes fixed on the faded sign. The letters wore like worn stones, their edges chipped and weathered. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA, they declared. A stark pronouncement in a world gone to dust. He gazed out upon the devastation, the skeletal remains of a once-thriving city. The streets a labyrinth of rubble and ash, the buildings reduced to charred skeletons that pierced the gray sky like shattered bone.\n\nA figure emerged from the haze, a young woman with a cardboard sign held aloft like a flag. Ellen Page, a name that meant nothing to him, stood frozen in time, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words scrawled on her sign seemed to writhe like a dying thing, a Sharpie's dark stroke bleeding into the cracked and faded surface. Burma, once a land of golden temples and ancient forests, had become a battleground, a clash of steel and stone, of flesh and blood.\n\nHe thought of the monks, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance in a land gone mad. The Saffron Revolution, a name that whispered through the wind, a testament to the power of the human spirit. But the junta had crushed it, their guns and their hatred silencing the voices of the people. The foreign journalists, with their cameras and their words, had been rounded up and imprisoned, their voices silenced forever.\n\nHe thought of the death toll, a number that swelled like a dark tide, a flood of blood that had stained the earth. Thirteen, they said, but Colonel Hla Win spoke of thousands, of bodies piled high like cordwood, of lives extinguished by the hand of the oppressor. He thought of the Roman emperors, their claims of divinity a thin veil for their tyranny. Of the Japanese emperors, their supposed godhood a mockery of the divine. And of the present day, where leaders spoke of their own infallibility, their words dripping with the honey of deceit.\n\nThe world was a tapestry of blood and ash, a weave of suffering and pain. He thought of the Tiananmen Square, the June 4th protest, where students and intellectuals had gathered to demand their rights. The death toll had been staggering, a number that danced in the wind like a ghost. And Rwanda, the genocide that had consumed a nation, leaving nothing but ash and bone in its wake. The Third Reich, a dark stain on the earth, a reminder of the depths of human depravity.\n\nHe stood there, lost in the wreckage of a world gone mad, the sign's words seared into his brain like a brand. HITLER IS ALIVE IN BURMA. The words seemed to pulse with a malevolent life, a reminder of the darkness that lurked in the heart of every human being. And in that moment, he knew that the world was a place of endless sorrow, a place where the light of hope flickered like a dying candle, threatened by the wind of despair.",
            "In the twilight of his years, Duke Ellington's legacy in the realm of jazz was forged, a testament to his unwavering dedication and the boundless creativity that coursed through his veins like a dark and vital river. His presence on the piano was a subtle but essential undercurrent, one that allowed the individual members of his orchestra to flourish like wildflowers in a verdant meadow. Ellington's masterful compositions, a symphony of intricate patterns and harmonies, provided a framework for the soloists to unfurl their talents, to improvise like leaves on a breezy autumn day. His skill in orchestrating the disparate voices of his players created a rich tapestry, one that wove together the threads of individual style and sound to produce music that was at once coherent, original, and sublime.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a venerable tome that chronicles the annals of musical history, speaks to Ellington's innovative spirit in its discussion of Creole Love Call, a piece that showcased his revolutionary approach to incorporating the human voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, deliberate  twelve-bar blues, a masterclass in subtlety and restraint, demonstrated Ellington's ability to coax texture and color from the voice, untethered from the burdens of lyrics. Creole Love Call, with its six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's capacity to complement the unique styles of his soloists, a gift that was evident throughout his oeuvre. The structure of the piece unfolds like a dark and winding stream, each chorus a tributary that feeds into the larger whole:\n\nChorus 1: A gentle call and response between voice and reeds, the voice gliding smoothly like a summer breeze, before roughening like the bark of a winter tree.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that probes the depths of the melody, lingering on blue notes like a solitary bird in a deserted sky.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo that soars like a bird in flight, its high register a piercing cry that cuts through the stillness, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase that rustles like leaves in an autumn gale.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response that reverberates through the reed and brass sections like the gentle lap of waves on a summer shore.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds assume the role of the caller, their voices rising like a dark and foreboding storm, backed by the syncopated stop time of the brass and rhythm sections, a rhythmic heartbeat that pulses like a drum in the night.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, the voice assuming the growl technique, soloing like an instrument, its rough, rasping texture a testament to the power of the human voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a tag, a brief and dissonant novelty that shatters like a broken glass on the stones of time, a final, fleeting impression that lingers like the ghost of a forgotten memory.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, a testament to his boundless creativity and innovative spirit, was a stylistic trait that permeated his work, a thread that wove together the disparate elements of his music like a spider's web in the moonlight. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington refined his craft, combining tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color, as the call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich and complementary sound, like the perfect harmony of two voices in a summer breeze. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) continued these ideas, as Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, sinuous elegance, like a snake slithering through the underbrush of a forgotten forest.",
            "She felt the void within her, a gnawing hunger that would not be satiated. It began to take hold when she was a girl, around the age of fourteen, as she stumbled into the awkward dance of adolescence. Three years passed, and the yearning remained, a constant, gnawing presence. She had come to realize that it was not a thing she sought, but a connection, a person to bridge the chasm within her. Yet, the boys that came and went, their clumsy attempts to woo her, only served to deepen the mystery. She puzzled over it, a riddle she could not solve, a question she could not answer.\n\nIn the stillness of her home, where her parents' calm and gentle words were the gentle lapping of a stream, she was a wild bird, a tempest in a teapot, her fiery spirit a challenge to the serenity that surrounded her. They argued, her parents and she, but it was never about the noise, the passion, the fire that burned within her. It was about her independence, her need to stretch her wings, to take flight. But today, the calm was shattered. The kitchen, a sanctuary, was shattered. Her mother's cry, a scream, shattered the stillness. She rushed in, her heart racing, her mind reeling. Her mother lay on the floor, a tortured figure, her words torn from her lips in short, gasping breaths. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out to comfort, to hold, to steady. \"Okay, Mom, tell me where to take you.\" The words tumbled from her lips, a mixture of panic and urgency. Her mother's hand guided hers, and with a strength born of love and determination, she lifted her mother from the floor, cradled her in her arms, and carried her to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her heart pounding in her chest, her mind fixed on the task at hand.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, assailed her, but she pushed it aside, her focus solely on her mother. She guided her to the reception desk, called for help, and watched as the wheels turned, the doctors arrived, and her mother was whisked away. She was left to wait, to worry, to wonder. Her mother had fallen, slipped off a stool, trying to reach a vase from a high cabinet. A simple accident, a moment's carelessness, and now her mother lay broken, her world shattered.",
            "The wilderness of the human heart, in its perpetual quest for sustenance, has long been drawn to the siren's call of the Mediterranean Diet.  Like a pilgrim navigating the labyrinthine paths of existence, a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" has been found to guide those who adhere to its ancient wisdom toward the Promised Land of reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, and the mortalities that stalk them like specters.  This sacred score, a modified version of the venerable Mediterranean Diet, beckons with its promise of higher consumption of plant foods - the verdant and life-giving fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - and the gentle touch of monounsaturated fat, like a summer breeze on a sun-kissed day.  And yet, like the dualities of existence, it tempers this bounty with the restraint of lower consumption of animal products and the noxious fumes of saturated fats.\n\nIn the annals of prior studies, the Med Diet has been found to be a harbinger of hope, an inverse association between its adherence and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality a beacon in the darkness.  An intervention trial, like a crucible of fire, has shown the Med Diet to be more effective than its low-fat counterpart in promoting the shedding of excess weight and the lowering of the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  Yet, like the elusive nature of the human heart, prior studies had not plumbed the depths of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this, the latest chapter of our inquiry, we followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had embarked on the grand adventure of life, their hearts unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  These women, participants in the majestic Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, were asked to chart their nutrient intake through six self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (\"FFQs) over a span of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004.  Like the unwavering dedication of a pilgrim, more than 95% of these women continued their participation throughout this odyssey.  The FFQs, like the ancient scriptures of the past, were subjected to validation studies, their reports of chronic heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke confirmed by the weight of medical records, hospital logs, autopsy reports, and death certificates.  Where records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, like the whispered secrets of the wind, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo chart the labyrinthine paths of life, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs, like the measured paces of a man journeying through the wilderness.  We adjusted for the confounding variables of age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, like the solemn oaths of a vow.\n\nLike the unfathomable mysteries of the human heart, Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke.  And lo, we found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were found.  Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile, like the radiant light of a beacon shining in the darkness, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The waste of a nation. A devastation wrought not by the hand of war nor the ravages of time, but by the wantonness of men. In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the United States of America succumbed to the abyss of a crushing financial crisis. Like a tree struck by lightning, the economy lay shattered, its limbs broken, its roots uprooted. The aftermath still lingers, a perpetual reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the fertile soil of 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by the insatiable hunger for power, relaxed the shackles of lending, unleashing a torrent of sub-prime loans into a financial system already teetering on the brink. Like a blind man feeling his way through a dark room, the nation careened towards the precipice, oblivious to the consequences of its actions. Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was coerced into expanding its reach, fueled by the insatiable demands of the Clinton administration and the siren song of profit.\n\nA prophetic voice, that of Steven Holmes of the New York Times, sounded a warning in 1999, but his words fell on deaf ears. \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" The seeds of destruction were sown, and the consequences were inevitable. As Holmes foresaw, the government-subsidized corporation would indeed run into trouble, prompting a government rescue that would rival the calamity of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nThe economy, once a behemoth of strength and vitality, was now a fragile vessel, precariously balanced on the razor's edge. The intricate web of mortgage-backed securities, adjustable-rate mortgages, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) had ensnared the very fabric of the nation's financial system, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to the slightest tremor. The housing market, once a symbol of promise and prosperity, had become a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury upon the world.\n\nAnd unleash it did. The housing bubble burst, like a stormy tempest, ripping through the nation's financial institutions like a scythe through wheat. The top five U.S. investment banks, once proud and mighty, now lay shattered, their assets totaling $4.1 trillion dollars, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their $5 trillion in mortgage debt a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash its fury upon the nation.\n\nThe nation stands today, scarred and battered, a testament to the wantonness of men. The financial crisis, a calamity of our own making, serves as a stark reminder of the hubris and folly that brought us to this pass. We must learn from the lessons of the past, lest we repeat the mistakes of our forebears and succumb to the abyss once more.",
            "The siren's call of exposition beckons, a treacherous shoal where the unwary writer risks shipwrecking their narrative on the rocks of tedium.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across her keyboard, her eyes scanning the blank page as she wrestles with the demon of Too Much Information.  The words flow, a cascade of exposition that threatens to drown the reader in a sea of unnecessary detail.\n\nBut what is exposition, this great betrayer of the written word?  Is it not the devil on the shoulder, whispering sweet nothings in the author's ear, urging them to tell, to reveal, to spell out the intricate tapestry of their characters' pasts?  In the world of film, exposition is the tedious monologue, the core-dump of information that leaves the audience checking their watches, counting down the minutes until the credits roll.\n\nYet, in the realm of fiction, the author's role is not that of a pedant, but of a weaver.  The writer must skillfully spin the threads of narrative, using every word, every phrase, every sentence to craft a tapestry of character, of world, of emotion.  To do this, they must eschew the temptation of exposition, that great siren's call, and instead show their readers the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.\n\nConsider the example of a heroine who meets her beloved at a certain place and time, marries him in a grand ceremony, and watches as he is brutally murdered before her eyes.  Two pages of detailed exposition might tell us this sequence of events, relegating the characters to mere footnotes in a narrative that cares more for the telling than the showing.  But what if, instead, the author took the time to craft a character with depth, with nuance, with a rich inner life?  What if the heroine's love for her husband was not just a given, but a slow-burning flame that warmed her very soul?  What if her marriage was a dance of give and take, a delicate balance of give and take that spoke to the very heart of her being?\n\nIn that moment, when the author chooses to show, not tell, the reader becomes more than just a passive observer.  They become an active participant, invested in the characters, their struggles, their triumphs, and their ultimate fate.  They mourn the loss of the husband, not just because of what the author tells them, but because of the slow-burning fire of the heroine's love, a flame that flickers with every heartbeat, every whispered promise, every tender gesture.\n\nSo, dear writer, take heed.  The siren's call of exposition is a treacherous one, tempting as it may be to rush past the details, to reveal too much, too quickly.  But it is in the showing, not the telling, that we find the meat of the story, the marrow of the bone.  It is in the slow, careful crafting of character, of world, of emotion, that we find the true power of the written word.",

The first came from a city called Columbus, a place I'd never set foot in, yet its stories seared themselves into my mind like brands on the hide of a steer. A man, Shad Hostettler by name, had taken the life of his wife, the details scarce, the images of his face twisted in a grimace, a visage of pure malevolence. The news crew moved on, their gaze lingering on the wound, a fleeting glance at the shattered soul of the woman, and then they left him to his darkness.\n\nThe next story, a young life laid low by the cruel hand of violence, a gunshot wound in the Sharon Woods area, a boy no more than a child, Travis Buyers his name. The news crew's interest waned, their words a whispered rumor, a hushed tone, as if the worth of his life was measured by the color of his skin. The faces of his people, dark and unremarkable, blended into the background, a forgotten scene in the grand tapestry of suffering.\n\nA shot in the night, a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet's kiss in the darkness, a .22 caliber rifle's deadly whisper. The news crew's eyes gleamed with a hunger for the sensational, a five-thousand dollar reward dangling like a carrot on a stick, a siren's call to the soul of the hunter.\n\nThe forecast, a promise of rain and thunderstorms, a weekend of gray skies and wet earth, the temperatures a mere afterthought, a whisper in the wind. The news crew's gaze drifted, their attention snagged on the next shiny thing, the next tale of woe to be spun.\n\nA robbery, a Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie sweatshirt, a six-foot frame, a hundred and fifty pounds, the news crew's words a litany of details, a drumbeat of racism, a reminder that some lives are less valuable than others.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a name that echoed through the annals of time, a convicted kingpin, a man who'd peddled death and destruction, a sentence of 300 months, a number that hung in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the damned. His skin, a darker shade, a label applied like a brand, a reminder that some lives are bound to their fate, their worth measured by the color of their skin.\n\nI turned off the box, the faces fading into the darkness, the stories lingering in my mind like a cold wind, a whispered warning of a world gone mad, a world where lives are reduced to labels, where some are valued and others are cast aside like so much trash.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unbreakable, forged in the fire of shared blood and experience. It is a bond that holds within it a labyrinth of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and the darker recesses of the human heart. In its depths, a brother sees not merely his sibling, but a reflection of himself, a mirror held up to the darkest corners of his own soul. It is in the most desperate of times that this bond is laid bare, revealing the very essence of their bond, whether it be redemptive or destructive. The consequences of this bond are a heavy burden to bear, a weight that must be shouldered by those who would walk this difficult path.\n\nIt is this very bond that is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers bound together by ties of blood and experience. Against a backdrop of a lush, decaying world, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their footsteps echoing through a landscape that seems to be slowly withering away. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a crescendo in a scene that will leave only one brother standing. The theme of this tale is woven throughout the narrative, a tapestry of complex emotions that are revealed through the characterization of Doodle, the younger brother, and the narrator's own introspective voice, which serves as a window into the inner workings of his mind.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's actions lies a single emotion: pride. It is a pride that is born of disappointment and frustration, of a desire to have a brother who can share in his joys and his sorrows. From the moment he and Doodle set out on their journey together, the protagonist is beset by a sense of resentment towards his younger brother. He had envisioned a companion, a partner in adventure, a brother who could keep pace with him in the wilds of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart and weakened limbs made such dreams seem like a cruel mockery. The young protagonist's fantasies are crushed, his world turned upside down by the harsh reality of his brother's limitations.\n\nIn the face of this disappointment, the protagonist's anger and frustration boil over, tempting him to consider the unthinkable: the suffocation of his own brother. It is a chilling thought, one that speaks to the darker recesses of the human heart. And yet, when Doodle smiles at him, something within the protagonist softens, his resolve weakened by the simple act of his brother's happiness. It is a fleeting moment, one that speaks to the enduring power of love and compassion in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the end, it is this bond between the two brothers that is the true subject of the story, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, a reminder that the complexities of human emotion can never be fully understood, but only experienced. It is a bond that will haunt the protagonist for the rest of his days, a reminder of the choices he made, and the consequences that followed.",
            "In the depths of the human form, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a tapestry of information woven from the threads of perception. As the world outside evolves, the metaphors that attempt to grasp its inner workings also shift, from the wax tablet of ancient lore to the modern computer, a complex mechanism that reflects the nascent understanding of the brain's workings. \n\nYet, these analogies, like fragile bridges, stretch across the chasm between the inner and outer worlds. They falter and fail, often leading to misconceptions and missteps in the pursuit of knowledge. The brain, a furnace of creative combustion, processes the sensory embers that ignite from the world around us – a caress of warmth, the thrum of sound, the vibrant dance of light. These sparks are transformed, transmuted by the brain's alchemy, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up, the pieces are assembled, a puzzle of color, shape, and contour, until the brain's machinery presents a coherent picture. Top-down, the understanding deepens, the object takes shape, and the mind's eye beholds its form.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, the brain's attention filter intervenes, a gatekeeper that determines what signal is worthy of consideration, what cognitive paths to illuminate. The world, a tapestry of details, is reduced to its essence, the noise diminished, the signal amplified. The attention filter is a subtle art, a delicate balance between the irrelevant and the vital, the fleeting and the eternal.\n\nInformation, a fleeting spark, must be stored, encoded, and maintained. The brain's memory, a palimpsest of experiences, is etched with the marks of sensation, of feeling, and of thought. There are many levels of memory, each a distinct stratum in the brain's stratigraphy. Sensory memory holds the brief, evanescent impressions of the world; working memory, a fleeting shadow, holds the information of the moment; long-term memory, a vast, dark repository, holds the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime.\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain is a mystery, a labyrinth that has yielded to numerous theories, each a thread in the tapestry of understanding. The semantic network model proposes a web of interconnected nodes, each a concept, linked by the bonds of association. The brain's vast, uncharted territories, a cartography of the mind, await exploration, a journey into the depths of the self.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of modernity, a specter of control looms, as envisioned by Aldous Huxley in the dystopian novel Brave New World. The impending threat of technology and the capitalistic system that upholds it is a dire portent, foretold in the bleak world of Huxley's creation. Here, the people are conditioned to prioritize community above individuality, their desires and aspirations suffocated by the insatiable need for immediate gratification. The citizens, mere pawns in a grand game, are ensnared by the World Controller's ideology, their wills shackled to the whims of their oppressors.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theology, Huxley's critique of the emerging economy of his time becomes starkly apparent. The pervasiveness of homogeny and reification in Brave New World serves as a scathing indictment of the societal ills that accompany unchecked capitalism. The Marxist notion of false consciousness is exemplified in the World State's manipulation of the common citizenry, rendering them oblivious to the true nature of their economic relations with the ruling class. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, and beyond, are reduced to mere automatons, their desires shaped by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, which instills in them an insatiable hunger for consumption and indulgence. This conditioning is, of course, orchestrated by the World Controller, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses.\n\nHegemony, the phenomenon of a dominant group exerting control over the subordinate classes, is a hallmark of the World State's totalitarian regime. The lower castes, ensnared in a web of ideological control, are oblivious to their oppression, while the upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, acquiesce to their station, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of capitalist exploitation. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are devoid of depth, a stark reflection of the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism. Love, a fundamental aspect of human experience, is all but extinct, replaced by a shallow, superficial existence, where relationships are reduced to calculated transactions, devoid of passion or authenticity.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the societal classes are complicit in their own subjugation, their complacency a testament to the insidious effects of capitalism. Their unwavering obedience to their assigned roles within the hierarchy serves as a grim reminder of the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are convinced of their own superiority as long as they continue to conform, consume, and obey. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a searing critique of the capitalistic system, a system that threatens to reduce humanity to a mere shadow of its former self, a soulless, loveless existence, devoid of hope or aspiration.",
            "It has been two and a half years since I stepped foot onto the grounds of University Park, the sprawling campus a labyrinth of buildings and pavement that stretches as far as the eye can see. For many, including myself, navigating this vast terrain is a daily struggle. My freshman year, I was ensconced in a dorm room in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a place where the only sounds that echoed through the halls were the distant hum of the stadium and the rustling of leaves in the wind. To reach classes in the Willard building, a bastion of learning that stood at the very heart of the campus, was a journey of 25 minutes on foot, a trek that seemed to take an eternity, especially when the rain poured down or the cold winds howled through the streets.\n\nBut it wasn't always so. I learned from an alumnus not much older than myself that in days gone by, the East Halls dorms stood apart from the rest of the campus, surrounded by a vast expanse of empty land that seemed to stretch on forever. That wilderness has since given way to a new era of development, with sports fields, gleaming new buildings, and apartments springing up like a phoenix from the ashes. As the campus continues to expand, the once-manageable distances between buildings have grown longer, making it a chore to get from one place to another.\n\nSo, what is the solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, it is the bicycle. Not just any bicycle, but one that is wielded by a student who is willing to take to the roads and brave the elements. For it is not the bicycle alone that holds the key to solving this problem, but rather the symbiosis between the student, the bike, and the campus itself. A campus that is built with the needs of the bicyclist in mind, with bike lanes, bike racks, and secure storage facilities, can make all the difference.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a friend who had recently taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. \"Bikes are great,\" he said with a smile. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he's right. For not only does bicycling provide a healthy dose of exercise, but it is also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more, a feat that would be impossible on foot.\n\nAs someone who now lives off-campus, I can attest to the benefits of having a bike. What was once a 25-minute walk to class in Thomas building now takes a mere 5 minutes on my bike. Of course, there are challenges to bicycling, especially on roads like Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to my classes. But for me, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Without my bike, I would be forced to rely on walking, a option that would take up an additional 30-40 minutes of my day, every day. That's over two and a half hours every week, time that I simply cannot spare.\n\nIn the end, the solution to the problem of mobility on campus is not just a matter of providing more bike lanes or bike racks. It's about creating a campus that is designed with the bicyclist in mind, a campus that values the efficiency, the exercise, and the independence that comes with riding a bike. For it is only when we prioritize the needs of the bicyclist that we can truly create a campus that is functional, sustainable, and just."
