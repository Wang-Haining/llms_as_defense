            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim corridors of human interaction, culture stands as a silent arbiter, casting its shadow over every negotiation. It's an entity defined as much by the void of what it is not as by the form of what it is, a specter neither singular nor unyielding. It resists the simplicity of broad strokes, eschewing the stereotypes that seek to contain it like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" Such declarations, in their sweeping generality, fail to capture the deeper essence. A negotiator, wise to the world’s ways, must peer beyond such superficial veneers, deciphering the intricate dance of cultural attitudes that sway the discourse at the table.\n\nAs one steps into the embrace of a foreign culture, it mirrors back an image refracted through the lens of one's own, compelling comparisons to emerge unbidden. To glimpse the soul of another culture is a journey through history and prejudice, a path laden with understanding rather than judgment. One does not seek to reshape this entity but to accept it, to maneuver within its confines, especially when the odds tilt against them. In lands not their own, respect for tradition and belief becomes the compass guiding them through the labyrinthine barriers of culture, propelling the negotiation forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach extends beyond borders, weaving its threads into the very fabric of corporate realms. A nation’s companies forge their own cultural identities, each as varied as the landscape itself. Some demand the grueling hours of toil, others embrace the ease of a more relaxed rhythm. Dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices become the tapestry through which this corporate culture is revealed. Even within a single country, the diversity of thought and practice from one company to another—and within regions of the same company—forms a mosaic of human endeavor. For those cultures that seem less stratified, whose surfaces appear seamless to the outsider, such uniformity merely beckons a deeper exploration.\n\nValues, those unseen currents, are the lifeblood of culture, revealing the why of its being. In a land where saving face or communal harmony reigns supreme, a negotiator will not sully the honor of his kin to win at the table. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, swift settlement is not the prize sought. These truths must be reckoned with before the first words are spoken in negotiation. Yet, the canny negotiator delves further, seeking to know the soul of his adversary, for in that personal knowing lies the power to shape destinies across the table.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So begins Psalm 14, casting its shadow over the minds of men who dare to ponder the divine. It marks the threshold of St. Anselm's questing for proof of a God who holds dominion over the hearts of the faithful. In this journey, Anselm is not alone. Thomas Aquinas walks beside him, both seeking a truth as old as time. And here we are tasked to weigh the worth of their words, to find whose voice rings clearer in the halls of faith and reason. We start with the presupposition of their shared belief, the God of the Bible, for to stray into realms of differently shaped deities would be to lose our way.\n\nNow, consider Anselm, who turns the gaze inward. He whispers that the proof is not out there but within, not in the stars or the stones but in the corridors of the mind. God exists, Anselm contends, because we cannot conceive of Him not existing. It is a subtle and winding path he lays, one that can tangle the unwary in its logic. Yet, there it stands, a monument to faith, a knowing that does not demand the crutch of evidence beyond the self. It is a belief borne of the soul's quiet conviction, that gentle whisper of faith that needs no louder proclamation.\n\nContrast this with the voice of Aquinas, who seeks a God not cloaked in mystery but revealed through the lens of reason. For Aquinas, faith is the seed, but reason is the tiller of the soil. He stands on the firm ground of logic, offering proofs like beads on a rosary: motion, cause, necessity, degree, and order. Each stringing together a tapestry of reason where the divine is the inevitable conclusion. In his hands, belief becomes a structure, as sure and solid as the stones of a cathedral, where faith is not a leap into the void but a step upon the firmament of understanding.\n\nYet, as we look upon these two, each with their truths and their failings, we find that neither alone holds the key to the kingdom. They are but paths converging on a mystery that remains just out of reach, a God perhaps known only in the spaces between faith and reason, in the quiet after the words have been spoken, and the silence where the heart rests.",
            "In the great sweep of Fitzgerald's tale, a world unfolds where colors bear the weight of meaning, casting shadows upon the lives they touch. There's a subtle alchemy in how he pairs words, and within this alchemy lies the truth of his craft. The Great Gatsby stands as a testament to the way Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of hues, each thread a whisper of intent. Colors like gold, green, white, and gray march across the pages, each with its own litany of significance. White and gray, especially, take on the guise of uniformity, white the finer, more genteel, while gray speaks of age and decline. They appear first on the scene as Daisy and Jordan drape themselves in white, a spectral hue that clings to them like innocence lost. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's revelry, Tom in a white shirt as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine powdered milky white. Even the city itself, New York's lower stretches, becomes a chasm of white, while the names of Gatsby's guests turn gray upon Nick's list, the very ink fading. \n\nFitzgerald's world is one where the ordinary, the unremarkable, wears white and gray. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood was white, a pale echo of their past. The valley of ashes sprawls gray, cars and land alike, the Italian child on the tracks is gray, the dog-seller a gray old man. The weight of these words builds until they become a code, marking what is unimportant, what is uniform, and what blends into the background of life's canvas. Daisy, in her white dresses, appears not as a woman of flesh and desire but as an ideal, a dream Gatsby clutches in his heart. Her presence is a gray haze, a white roadster, a white dress in the moments before confrontation. Fitzgerald paints her in these colors, a picture of a world that is less about the living and more about the longing, the uniformity that stretches like the gray land beneath an endless sky.",

The honey is sweet and the peppers burn with the fire of the sun. There is a market here, a place where the folk gather, yearning for the fruits of organic labor, where eggs and milk from untamed lands find their way to tables. The land itself, these organic farms, they are open to the wanderer, offering paths for those who seek the solace of nature, the sight of birds in flight. Here, a landowner might find the grace of government favor, might improve the earth itself, might open the soil to the feet of the curious, the seekers of knowledge and of profit. \n\nYet there is a price to be paid.

The labor is fierce and unending, the hands weary from the toil of pulling weeds and battling pests, of feeding the earth in ways that nature intended. The losses are keenly felt, for the small farmer lacks the might of the great agricultural machines. Still, there are those who plant cover crops, who rotate the grazing of beasts, who pull the invaders from the soil to let the native flora breathe. Here, too, the landowner might seek the wisdom of others, to learn how to weave together the threads of profit and preservation.\n\nThis tale unfolds on a tract of land near Potrero, in the unclaimed reaches of San Diego County. Spanning 160 acres, it lies in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, where chaparral and oak woodland meet the grasslands brought from across the sea. It is a place of many species, some of which teeter on the brink, like the Stephens’ kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, may soon follow them into the annals of the endangered. \n\nThis land was once the domain of those who came before, the Native Americans, and later the cattlemen and sellers of cordwood who carved their lives from the earth in the waning years of the nineteenth century. It was a piece of an original homestead, perhaps grazed by cattle, perhaps the source of wood for the hearths that once burned in the night.\n\nIn this story, I took a parcel from a digital ledger of land, studied the ways in which a small farmer might find aid from the hands of government, might preserve the wildness of the land while seeking to draw forth its bounty. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model of what might be, should one choose to walk this path.",
            "In the world there exists a bond between brothers, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared breath. A bond that is unyielding and eternal, carrying within it the weight of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. Brothers know each other with a knowing that runs deeper than the marrow of their bones, each seeing in the other a mirror of himself. In moments of desperation, the true fabric of this bond is revealed, whether it be woven of good or evil. These emotions, when laid bare, come with a toll heavy and inescapable. To understand the emotions entwined within this fraternal connection is to bear the burden of their consequences. To meet a brother's gaze is to peer into the depths of one's own soul, stripped of the masks worn for the world. It is in their deeds and their aftermath that one's true nature is found. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the two brothers walk this path, navigating the tempest of emotions that accompany them. Amidst a landscape rich and alive, they embark on a journey doomed from the start. In the end, the bitterness of disappointment and the fierce heat of pride collide, and only one brother emerges from the storm. This theme is etched through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the interplay between them, as well as the narrator's perspective, which casts light on the tangled web of feelings within the protagonist and his perception of the world, both of which cast shadows on his actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's deeds lies the singular force of pride. From the first breath he shares with his fragile brother, Doodle, to their last, ill-fated odyssey, resentment simmers within him. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, to teach him to hold breath beneath the water, to run, to leap, to climb the vines twisting through Old Woman Swamp. He craved a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch beside him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle's frailty, his heart too weak to bear the weight of life, let alone the thrill of racing and climbing. It was a cruel blow to the young boy, his mind a cauldron of wild imaginings, to have those visions snuffed out in an instant. Anger stirred within him, dark thoughts of smothering the life from the small child flickering across his mind. What child, you might ask, would harbor such thoughts? But then, the simple curve of Doodle's smile breaks through, softening the hardness in his heart. Such a small act, yet it kindled hope within the boy. It showed that his resolve was but a fleeting shadow. Somewhere deep within, there was an instinctive love for his brother, a love that whispered in the dark corners of his mind.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a maze of intricate pathways lies sprawling, where thoughts weave and meander like rivers through the dust of time. Once, in the dawn of man's understanding, the brain was likened to a simple wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a tome of knowledge bound in leather and ink, and now to the cold machinations of a machine, ever calculating, ever processing. But these are mere shadows and reflections, pale imitations of the truth, and one must tread carefully, for they can lead astray.\n\nThe world enters the mind through the senses, those ancient gatekeepers who transform the touch of skin, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, or the light of stars into the language of the soul, a tongue of electrochemical fire. This raw tapestry is then spun and woven by the brain's algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Consider the image of a black box stark against a field of white; the bottom-up gaze gathers fragments of color and shape, marking the edges where darkness meets the light, and in this, finds a box. The top-down gaze, with the wisdom of steps taken before, might discern not a void but a solid shape, black as the night.\n\nThrough this complexity, an unseen hand, the attention filter, sifts through the noise and the chaos, deciding what shall pass and what shall fall away. It is why, among a sea of grass beneath your feet, each blade remains unseen, yet the call of your name pierces through the clamor of a crowded room, clear and true. The mind is a stage of unending acts, where attention is the director, guiding the play.\n\nBut before the mind can ponder, it must remember. Memory is the keeper of time, with chambers for the sensory, the fleeting, and the enduring. In the beginning, the world is etched into the mind, encoded in ways as varied as the senses themselves. A word can be known by its shape, its sound, or its meaning. Once etched, it is held in place, perhaps by the flicker of electricity through a web of neurons for the short-lived memories, or by the very structure of proteins for those that endure.\n\nThere are many who seek to chart this territory, some with the tools of science, others with the mind's own map, and still others through the study of the flesh itself. In the semantic network, ideas are stars in a constellation, each linked to another by the invisible threads of meaning. A chair to a table, a table to wood, and so the web is spun.\n\nAnd so it is, the mind, a great and terrible machine, ever turning, ever creating, a mystery that beckons and eludes.",
            "In the year of 2007, the United States found itself cast into a shadow of financial ruin. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market lay shattered, and the great titans of industry stood as hollowed shells upon the landscape of commerce. This recession, relentless and unyielding, marches on even now. And so we ask, how did this calamity come to pass, and what might we do to halt its advance? In the starkest terms, it was the folly of political minds, driven by self-interest and devoid of foresight, that compelled banks and firms to peddle subprime loans into a financial system not yet grown to withstand such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giants in the world of mortgages, were goaded into weaving these precarious loans into the fabric of CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers faltered, as they inevitably did, the banks found their coffers bare, and the chaos spread outwards, touching every corner of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this turmoil were sown in the twilight years of the last century, during the reign of Clinton. A President, eager to find favor and extend his grasp on power, loosened the chains of lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the disaster that would follow. It was Steven Holmes of the New York Times who wrote in 1999 of the pressure upon Fannie Mae to open the gates of homeownership to those of lesser means, a pressure that stemmed from both the administration and the hunger of shareholders for ever-growing profit. He saw with clarity the peril that lay ahead, predicting the need for a rescue akin to that which had come before in the days of the savings and loan crisis. And so it was that the reckless granting of loans would, as foretold, lead to the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe fabric of the financial world had become a tangle of complexity, as mortgages took on new and bewildering forms. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations wove together, binding more and more of the economy to the fate of the housing market. Households and financial entities alike found themselves overextended, standing precariously upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of fortune.\n\nThe bubble, of course, did burst, and those institutions that had wagered upon the solidity of these mortgage-backed securities were left to reckon with their folly. By 2007, the top five investment banks bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation’s economic output. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch found themselves sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs alongside Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the shackles of commercial banking, bound by stringent oversight. As for Fannie and Freddie, they were engulfed in a sea of $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and by September of 2008, they too were brought under the yoke of government control.",
            "The tale unfolds and there is a place where the words must bear the weight of the story. Stretching out like a lone hawk in the morning sky, hoping to capture the breath of those who linger on the page. Or else it is the place where the eyes grow heavy and the mind drifts away, leaving curses in their wake. Dr. Merlin, it is said, would growl at the screen when caught amid a deluge of needless words, not even of the entertaining sort.\n\nExposition, the betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThose who take kindly to the craft of writing know well the old adage, \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, Dr. Merlin finds herself entangled in long, barren passages where little stirs or too much overwhelms. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay the groundwork of history swiftly so the tale might move to brighter pastures (not to be confused with that other whisper, the one that tempts you to divulge every chapter of each character's past).\n\nExposition is the telling of what transpired, often laid bare in simple words. In the moving pictures, it is when one soul imparts to another a torrent of narrative, like some ancient mariner's tale. In the written word, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nTake this for instance. As you turn the pages of a story, you are told the maiden met her love in a certain place at a certain time, that they wed amidst splendor, and that he fell, slain, before her eyes. You would not reckon this tale to be spun in but two pages, with a mere scattering of their words. You would hope the writer would linger on the husband's nature, revealing through his voice and gesture the depth of his love, and you would expect the heroine to show, through the great and small, how his being in her life had transformed and enriched it (especially if the tale later claims this to be so). A rightful introduction to the husband would bind you to his fate and grant you insight into the woman he cherished: what she perceived in him, how their bond was forged, hints of her own musings and dreams as mirrored in his gaze, and so on. You would grieve his loss with her and thus draw closer to her very soul.\n\nIn essence, you would seek the marrow upon the bare bone of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a keeper of stories, it is upon you to provide that marrow. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, carries on*) There is often the urge to hasten over things unremarkable. You might bring forth a new character, knowing he once served in the Air Force, now oversees a gas station by night, wed twice, childless, a fisherman on lazy weekends, harboring a quiet hope to one day own that very gas station, and had Eggs Benedict to start his day.",
            "In the gray dawn of the day, the news flickered on the screen like a silent oracle, casting shadows of the world beyond. From Columbus, Ohio, the stories unfolded, each one a testament to the darkness that lay beneath the surface of our lives. The first, a tale of violence in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had turned his hand against his own flesh. His wife's name was a secret kept by the ether, but his face, captured in the cold eye of the camera, was a portrait of malevolence. The tale was brief, a mere whisper of the horror that had transpired, yet it lingered in the mind like a specter.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, whose life was hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods area, a place marked by the absence of justice. The SWAT team scoured the shadows for answers, but the silence was unbroken. The brevity of this telling, a reflection of a world where the color of one's skin determined the weight of one's story. The media, a fickle beast, often turned a blind eye to the plight of those whose skin was dark as night, their cries for justice swallowed by the indifference of the world.\n\nA gunshot, like a distant thunder, had marred the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet from a .22 caliber rifle the culprit. The promise of gold, five thousand dollars' worth, hung in the air for those who could unravel the mystery. The news moved on, swift as a river, to the coming storms, the promise of rain and thunder hanging over the city like a shroud, the temperatures a mere footnote in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThere was talk of a robbery, a dark-skinned man cloaked in a hooded garment, his presence described in detail, the color of his skin a note played over and again. The emphasis on his darkness, a reminder of the biases that ran deep in the veins of society.\n\nAnd then, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man from Texas whose life had been a dance with the devil of drugs. His fate sealed with a sentence of twenty-five years, spoken in the strange tongue of \"300 months,\" as if the weight of his punishment could be shifted by the turning of words. His heritage, Hispanic, was noted, though it seemed but a shadow in the grand narrative of his crimes.\n\nThe stories, like footprints in the ash, lingered in the mind, each one a reminder of the world as it was, a place where the past and present wove together in a tapestry of light and shadow.",
            "In the world of finance where shadows lengthen and figures shift, there exists a thing called an ETF. A creature not unlike an exchange traded fund, born to follow the trails of indices or commodities or a basket of assets. Like a wandering hound on the scent, its nature is fluid, trading as it does like a stock upon the open market. It bears within it the breadth of an index fund, yet clutches the singularity of a lone stock, offering the promise of short selling, buying on margin, and the purchase of a solitary share. These lures glitter like gold in the eyes of the seeker. The expense ratios of these ETFs are lean, far leaner than the average mutual fund, a siren's song to the thrifty. Yet, alongside these boons lie the thorns, for one must pay a commission as one would with any stock. There lies another promise in the wide array of funds, spread vast like the prairie. But the wise investor knows to tread with care, to discern if these proclaimed virtues like diversification hold true, and to what degree they do. Our gaze will rest upon the ETF known as IHF, setting it against the top ten holdings that form its backbone, seeking to unravel whether the merits of a single ETF compare to the bounty of a diversified collection of ten stocks, and if within the same stocks there lies a better arrangement, a sharper edge or return.\n\nTo weigh the worth of the ETF, it becomes a task too great to encompass every holding, and so we choose to focus on the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's essence. These ten stand as pillars, and their percentage of the whole is etched below.\n\nTo glean an understanding of how these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF in its entirety, we take their current share of the assets, normalized to a full circle, to determine the weight each carries in a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it made solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it emerges that a portfolio graced only by the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in the harvest. The Beta too is lighter, by .12, than that of the ETF whole. Thus far, it seems that a gathering of merely the top ten holdings might offer a richer return with a gentler Beta. Yet, there hovers the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not worlds apart in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different in the eyes of numbers, the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks is measured and set to a full hundred, to compare their collective deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "They saw the drop in the numbers of those who logged their journeys and it fell like a cold shadow cast across the third month of the endeavor. And there was no ready answer to the question why. Perhaps it was the winter's breath, chilling the bones of those who would walk or ride, a New England campus silent beneath its frost. Or it was the end of things, of semesters and the harried souls racing to finish what they had started, grades to be meted out like judgments in the cold light of December. The logs, forgotten perhaps, lost among the myriad tasks that beset them. And there was the coming of the season of festivities where the world turned inward and the campus lay fallow, its halls hollow and empty, a month-long slumber before the year's turning and the classes resumed. Thus, the logs lay scarce in February, a mystery unsolved. The fervor of beginnings had waned, the flame guttering, as such things do. And so there came the Carpool Challenge, a rallying cry to stir the hearts once more, a March campaign swift and bright and it did bring forth an increase, though the challenge remained as before, how to sustain the breath of life in this endeavor against the tides of indifference and the rhythms of the academic calendar.\n\nYet there was another truth, buried deep, the love of the open road and the solitary freedom it promised. The car, a symbol of independence, unyielding in its cultural roots. Incentives were offered, tokens of gratitude in the form of gift cards, small treasures for the weary traveler, to the local stores and cafes, a balm for the soul. But one wonders what greater prizes might have wrought, a bicycle perhaps, or the promise of a hybrid or electric car. These fantasies might have drawn forth those who hesitated, kindling a new fire where the old had waned. The prizes, unchanging, might have held more allure had they grown in worth with each passing month. To announce in the heart of December a grand reward would have surely quickened the pace of those who had grown tired. One can only ponder what might have been, had the stakes been raised and the call to action resounded more fervently amidst the cold and quiet of the year’s end.",
            "In the gloom of the Library of Congress, I found myself poring over the early Edison films, drawn to their trickery like a moth to a forgotten flame. Fifteen they were, from the dying whispers of the nineteenth century to the first murmurs of the twentieth. Films that played with the mind's eye, slipping reality through the cracks of the reel with a sleight of hand born of clever editing. My journey through these shadows aimed to uncover the poetic threads binding these films, and to sift through the dust for those rare gems that dared to step beyond their time-worn bounds. \n\nAt the turn of the century, most trick films were bound to their sets, framed by the rigid proscenium, the camera a watchful sentinel that never moved, holding fast to its creed of one shot, one film. Yet, there were those brave few that inched towards the dawn of a new era, introducing a dance of multiple shots that whispered of change.\n\nWhat they shared, these trick films, was a devotion to the interior, a stage where the camera stood steadfast. No pursuit of figures, no shift in view, for the lens was rooted in its theatrical past, echoing the vaudeville and magic acts that had preceded it. Movement was but a lateral waltz, a side-to-side glide with no venture towards the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors drift from the right, skimming the stage like ghosts, never drawing the camera from its fixed gaze.\n\nThe proscenium's embrace meant long shots reigned supreme, with medium shots as rare companions, and the intimacy of close-ups was a stranger. The theater's influence was strong, its essence distilled into every frame, where the audience's gaze was framed by the stage's boundary. Actors held their ground, neither advancing nor retreating, leaving the close-up an untapped well.\n\nIn those early days, trick films held to the notion that one conceptual shot was a film entire. A constraint that kept their tales brief, their magic confined to a minute's breath, dictated by the frames per second. Their narratives were simple conjurings, vanishing acts, and clever exchanges without the weight of story. Yet, within the illusion of a single shot, lay the hidden seams of multiple, stitched together to conjure apparitions. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). At first glance, a seamless vision, yet upon closer inspection, the moment of trickery reveals itself, the shift where Mary's severed head begins its deceit, though to the viewer, it remains a singular shot.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, where the past meets the present, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, an old-new amalgamation that Ian Watt has called an oxymoron in his exploration, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic spirit, like an ancient shadow, has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of shallowness yet revered for its terrible and sublime essence, as Burke once noted. The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole's creation, emerged from this twilight, a fusion of the ancient and the modern, carving a path for the Gothic genre, a new voice in the wilderness of literature. Walpole drew from the \"old\" theatrics and the 'new' mimicry of nature, weaving them into what he proclaimed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre borrows heavily from the medieval, a nod to the gothic theater, architecture, and traditions of yore. Even then, the word \"gothic\" was a ghost from many pasts, a descriptor for peoples, styles, epochs, carrying the weight of the archaic and the unsophisticated against the tide of modernity. It is this blend of the theatrical Gothic with the new novel's intimate lens on human psychology that has allowed the Gothic to linger through the ages, becoming both a relic and a revelation to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmidst these shadows, the notion of Chivalry rises, like a specter in the Gothic tales. This medieval code, the making of a knight, survives and transforms in The Castle of Otranto, that first Gothic novel. Chivalry held a mirror to the Gothic writers, reflecting the noble knight, brave and honorable, a mirror to what they believed was missing in their world. Through chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is painted in romantic hues, a wistful look forward to Romanticism, an endeavor to mend the present's fractures. Walpole, in the storm of political unrest, looked back at the noble silhouettes of history, despairing at the shadows of his own time. Engulfed in the political turmoil and accusations, his mind turned, perhaps unconsciously, to the lost moral compass and goodness of the Gothic age, absent in his society. This longing is etched in his characters, especially in Frederic, a figure of chivalry, whose reputation precedes him. Frederic steps from the pages, a prince forged in adversity, a tragic figure believed slain by infidels. His image is crafted with chivalric strokes, exaggerated in a way that heralds the Gothic's love for excess, a hallmark to come.",
            "In the bare bones of commerce lies the great machinery of supply chain management, an endless march of goods from the moment a customer dreams of them to their birth in the raw and unformed. It was in the early days of 1982 when a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant, named this stream of processes. He spoke of it as one might speak of a river, a flow of planning and executing and controlling the journey that goods must take, all to sate the needs of the waiting customer. Six are the pillars on which this chain rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers, like ancient alchemists, wield these elements to craft a service that meets the restless demands of those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first note in this symphony of commerce, stands as the bedrock of the supply chain. It is here that the questions of when and why and where and how ring out, echoing in the minds of those who must decide. The market, a fickle beast, whispers its demands, and the managers listen with intent, deciphering the wants of the masses. With their ears to this ground, they set about determining what must be made, and in what numbers. The place of creation is chosen with care, a factory or plant that promises both volume and quality, all in the pursuit of the customer’s satisfaction. Once the ground is laid, the managers turn their eyes to the scheduling of tasks and the upkeep of the machines that will bring their plans to life. In this meticulous dance, every step is crucial, for a misstep could cost dearly in time and gold. I have seen the inner workings of places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest detail is mapped, from the color of an employee’s shirt to the route a truck must take. Such plans are the lifeblood of a company, ensuring a smooth course free of confusion and discord.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, stands as a testament to the art of decision-making. Here, the strategic minds ponder the core strengths of their facilities, choosing partnerships for outsourcing that will bolster these strengths. In this complex web, a single product may owe its existence to many hands, each division a world unto itself with its own tools and craftsmen. The manager stands as a conductor, deciding which division will play which part, or whether another company should join the orchestra. The heart of this decision is velocity, the power to deliver speed and quality while keeping costs low, a feat much sought after in the halls of business.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of the Victorian age, where the light plays tricks on the eyes and the echo of footsteps is swallowed by the darkness, there are novels that step away from the gilded halls of aristocracy to wander in the terrain of the unknown. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, they are called. Each a vessel of mystery and the uncanny, diverging from the well-trodden path, their characters emerging from the shadows with motives laid bare by the fires of the bizarre.\n\nThe words came at him like a storm, a cacophony of voices and sounds that smothered the air around him. Between Sikes and Crackit he walked, their quarrel ringing in his ears, his own voice mingling with theirs in the fog of his mind. And then, the crack of gunfire, and the world erupted in chaos, a whirl of cries and lights that seared his vision as a phantom hand pulled him away. Amidst this tempest, a dull ache gnawed at him, relentless and unforgiving. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn such tales, the dream is a doorway, a passageway where reality bends and the soul's torment is laid out in stark relief. In Oliver’s world, dreams are a revelation of his inner turmoil, a canvas painted with the colors of his suffering and his awakening to the world’s cruel truths. Chapter 28 finds him immersed in the memory of gunfire, caught in a dream's embrace, seeking refuge yet finding none. The scene unfolds with a sense of helplessness, the grip of fate tight and unyielding. The specters of Sikes and Crackit haunt him, specters born of fear and powerlessness. He is swept away by forces unseen, his senses dulled, pain and dread entwined. Here lies the heart of Oliver’s struggle: the absence of agency, the chains of destiny that bind him, rendering him a passive witness to his own life's unraveling. The specter of Fagin looms large, a shadow cast over Oliver's spirit, whispering resignation into his ear, sapping the will to resist. For in these moments, the boy's struggle is not just with the world, but with the creeping despair that seeks to claim him.\n\nThe hours crept by - a day passed, if it could be called day at all, swallowed by the night that followed. Night stretched on, a silent eternity, yet fleeting in its passing, a passage through the void, the minutes fleeing like shadows from the light.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the halls of a school, an after-hours sanctuary for young minds, lending what aid I could to children finding their way through the murk of learning. My charge was to guide them, these small seekers, in subjects that gave them pause. My own strength lay in the words and the stories they told. Among them was a boy called Adrian, small of stature, perhaps third or fourth grade, facing a peculiar struggle with the written word. Some letters he grasped with ease, others slipped through his understanding like sand through fingers. It puzzled me, for he spoke the language with flawless clarity, though his heritage was Latino. We wrestled with the words until one day his mother came, speaking only in her native tongue, and the truth struck me with the force of revelation. The boy knew the words, but not the symbols of the language they formed. In that moment, a knowledge settled in me, and I could only hope it helped him find his way.\n\nThis tale I share not for its own sake but to lay bare the silent walls that rise in our schools, here in this sun-baked land of California. A barrier not of bricks but of tongues. It is a truth hidden in plain sight, that a child may speak the language and yet be a stranger to its written form. The question we must ask is not if this wall exists, for it surely does, but how we might breach it. For Adrian, a path lay in the letters and sounds that eluded him. Yet for others, those who know not the language of this land, the answer is not so simple. There is no solitary cure. The dual language, the immersion in the mainstream, the private guides, the classes of English as a second tongue—none alone will tear down this wall. It is in their union that hope lies.\n\nTo take the dual language path is to open doors not only for those whose first words were in the songs of Spanish but for all children. Such programs have shown their worth, their students rising above their peers. Yet fear shadows their implementation, whispers that they waste what cannot be squandered, that the many reap no reward. But these fears are unfounded. Were we to embrace such learning as common practice, all would find enrichment. The question remains, how? Must every teacher speak in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. Yet there is no reason we cannot place among them those who do, as aides or tutors, guides fluent in the languages of many.",
            "Since those first glimmers of awareness, the notion has been seeded in us that something larger, ineffable, stands beyond the edge of our understanding. Some are led to sit in pews and listen for whispers of the divine, while others search within, grasping at the shadows of their own souls. Many cling to the faith of their forebears, worn paths trodden by countless feet before them. And yet, there are those who turn their backs on such teachings, declaring their own small world the measure of all things. We may take up one creed only to cast it aside for another, as if the truth were a garment that could be changed with the seasons. Whatever road we walk, we strive to carve out a niche for ourselves, seeking the flicker of light that promises to guide us from the depths of night into the warmth of day.\n\nA cardinal, my father murmured, when I questioned him about his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming a relentless rhythm atop the tin roof, each of us with a cigarette between our fingers. The gutters spewed torrents, drowning the greenery that bordered the porch's edge. His gaze was lost in the rain, a look that seemed to drift between the past and some uncharted horizon. Over the months, he'd dwindled, his clothes hanging loose as though they belonged to another, his hair thinned like a memory fading. He kept his eyes on the rain, as if meeting mine would somehow anchor his spirit. I felt the silence between us, a chasm I dared not cross, for to speak of departure would make it so. I reached for him, drew closer, and together we watched the rain fall in the waning light of June.\n\nHe slipped away in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments had bought him time, though what worth was time when pain was its currency, I could not fathom. What deity, I wondered in the lonely dark, would weave such a tapestry of suffering? I found no solace in prayers spent on deaf ears, convinced that if God ever listened, He'd long since turned away.\n\nI could not bear witness to that final breath, the extinguishing of the life that had given me mine. I refused to see him as he waned, preferring the echoes of his laughter to the silence of his end. I knew him better than the others did, knew he would not want me there, watching as he drifted into the unknown. I folded myself into my bed and let the world pass by, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nBut no call ever came.",
            "In the shadowed expanse of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a figure carved from the very soil he tended. An advocate for Republicanism, his roots were deep in the land, an agriculturalist by nature and a man for whom the earth was both a canvas and a creed. His brief sojourn into the realm of politics did not temper his voice, one of outspoken fervor for the freedom of the individual and the restraint of government. His heart beat for the agrarian life, a rhythm that guided his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the courts that ruled the land.\n\nTaylor saw this young nation, the United States, as a blank slate, untouched by the ancient traditions that bound older lands. Here was a chance to craft an ideal, to birth a system where self-governance could flourish. He held fast to the notion that the rights of man were natural and intertwined, each reliant on the other. Deny one, and the whole would crumble, their worth diminished. Thus, these rights must lie beyond the grasp of government. In the state of nature, he said, it was the strong and the cunning who thrived, but civilization demanded a different order.\n\nTo forge this dream, Taylor knew a government must reckon with the dual nature of man, both virtuous and vile. He spoke of a dual morality, where every virtue and vice of governance was but a reflection of humanity itself. Good governance, Taylor declared, safeguarded private property, nurtured the land, and spurned the greedy clutches of capitalism. Such a government, built on principles true and just, would stand steady, even as those who led it succumbed to greed and self-interest. For Taylor, self-interest was the engine of man, only darkened when it bred societies that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant government was needed to chain man's inherent evil, ever watchful to exclude the bad.\n\nIn the company of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a document that, to him, should bind the Federal government in chains of explicit limits. He saw the sprawl of Federal power as a costly path to despotism. Yet he warned against a simple literalism, for without the spirit of the Founders' intentions, such readings could twist to corruption. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, for it spoke of sovereign states bound together, not as one monolith, but as a gathering of equals.",
            "He stood there, gaze fixed downward, seeing but not seeing, his mind a void that absorbed the view without judgment or understanding. The practiced eye of a man who had long since learned to separate the sight from the meaning, a mind that cataloged what it saw but refused to know it, thoughts slipping like whispers through the dark, as if they were not thoughts at all but a mere murmuring of experience washing over him with the ease of a brook over stones.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a moment of whim, he had taken the advice of an artist friend and bought a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. A book meant to teach one the art of seeing, of understanding the world through the tip of a pencil, through the lens of line and form. It spoke of frames, of ways to distill the chaos of the world—a bowl of fruit in the cluttered sprawl of a kitchen—into something simple, something graspable, a bowl on a table in a realm of its own.\n\nYet now, as he stood over the bowl before him, he found no such frame to enclose his sight. There was only the vastness of his awe, a vision too full to be contained. The masters had their colors—Picasso his blues, Monet his greens, those artists of old basking in their prismatic glory. But here, if there was to be any art to his vision, it was the art of brown. This was the canvas spread before him, the genesis of his own peculiar masterpiece.\n\nHis fingers settled upon the tool of his creation, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind finding shape in action. Water swirled beneath him, a dance of clarity and calm, carrying with it the fragments of what had been. Again his hand struck, more frantic now, commanding the handle with insistence. But still the stubborn brown form clung to the bottom of the porcelain, unmoved, defiant.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted firm, the tie at his throat a strangling knot of green. A slight frown creased his brow as he regarded the insolent mass left behind by some nameless soul—a message in waste for the weary keepers of the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, winding it round and round until his hand was swathed like some ancient embalmed thing. He straightened, then bent low, his hand descending into the bowl with the careful grace of a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving feast.",
            "The young ones are dying out there on the roads, a grim tally kept by fate and folly. This confluence of hazard, this grim conjoining of statistics, finds its root in the unready minds of the youngest among us. The National Institutes of Health tells a tale of brains not yet ripened for the perils of the road. Inexperience, too, sits heavy at the heart of this dark matter. It is this lack of knowing that leads them astray, to more deaths, to the rolling of vehicles, to the speed that sings of oblivion, to roadsides that catch them unawares.\n\nThey fare worse when traveling in packs, these youths, for they are wont to gather and ride, heedless of the danger. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has mapped the correlation between the age of those who sit beside them and the wreckage left in their wake.\n\nCalifornia and other lands have sought to mend this with temporary measures, provisional licenses that bind the hours of their travels and put a stop to the bearing of fellow minors as passengers.\n\nYet these provisional licenses are but a finger in the dam. The root lies deeper, for by all measures, these young souls are not yet fit to shoulder the burdens of the open road. Marvin Zuckerman, a student of the mind, speaks of eighteen as still too tender an age for such liberty. USA Today bears witness to his findings, the yearning of those not yet reached the age of nineteen, to court risk for the thrill it brings. It stands to reason that patience might temper this seeking, that time might dull the edge of their recklessness.\n\nShould we continue to hand the keys to the young, we shall see the grim harvest continue, the toll rising to heights yet unimagined. Come 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood these roads, a legion of new drivers eager to test their mettle.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this is a simple enough matter. Schools might still lay the groundwork with their teachings, yet none under eighteen should know the power that lies beneath their feet. A provisional permit might yet precede the granting of full license, demanding a measure of training that echoes the standards of states such as California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nFor the numbers that haunt us come from every corner of the land, and a single, unified decree could stand as a bulwark against this tide. What I propose is no new thing, but it is a thing that must be done.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies a disorder called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a shadowy realm where the brain struggles to sift through the sounds that life throws its way. This disorder, as defined by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, concerns itself with the central nervous system's ability to process auditory information, a process that is both delicate and mysterious. For those who wander this path, the hearing is not the issue. They hear as others do, yet the mind falters, unable to untangle the threads of sound from the tapestry of existence.\n\nThe whispers of CAPD trace back to the mid-twentieth century, to a time when it was but a fledgling thought, a disorder known then as auditory imperception. It was the Italians, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who began to unravel its secrets, crafting tests in the year of 1954. By 1961, Kimura had stepped into the fray, introducing methods to probe the dichotic nature of perception, revealing the complex physiology beneath. A gathering of minds in 1977 stirred the air with new questions, new paths to tread.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. Those it touches may find themselves adrift in space, unable to pinpoint a sound's origin or distinguish one sound from a chorus of noise. Patterns slip through their fingers, the subtle shifts in speech lost to them like whispers in the wind. Sounds can clash, one blotting out the next, leaving them without the clarity they seek. The sequence of sound eludes them, a puzzle unsolved, a story untold.\n\nTo diagnose this elusive disorder, one must embark on a journey of observation and testing. Audiologists and psychologists, with their tools and measures, seek to peel back the layers of auditory behavior, to understand how the patient responds to the world of sound. Yet, the road remains uncertain. No single test shines a light on CAPD's depths, and its origins are shrouded in mystery. Tests, both simple and complex, ask the patient to separate the cacophony, to find meaning in a series of spoken words or numbers. More intricate examinations delve into the ear's acoustics, measuring the echoes of sound within.\n\nAnd so, the understanding of CAPD continues, a flickering light in the vast darkness of the human mind.",
            "In the pursuit of a life in social work, I find myself drawn toward the path that leads to the Division of Family and Children Services. A path that promises the chance to stand sentinel for those children cast into the shadows of abuse and neglect. A place where troubled families seek refuge and understanding. It is here I aim to lay down the values I hold dear: service to others, respect for every soul, an ethical compass unwavering, a commitment to mend the fractured bonds between people, and an ongoing quest to refine my own professional competence. These are not mere tenets of social work; they are the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nThe urge to help others has been a constant whisper in my heart, even as the path forward lay obscured by uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the long halls of college, I witnessed souls grappling with their own ghosts, some fleeing in denial, others resorting to means that offered no peace. It was these encounters that nudged me toward a Bachelor's in Psychology. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in the year 2009, the road ahead remained a mystery. That summer, a friend led me to a trembling boy of sixteen, perched on her couch, seeking refuge from the storm that was his parents. The next day, he called upon the law to intervene. I followed the call to his home, a silent observer with a newly minted degree in Psychology. The officers, bound by the limits of the law, turned to me. I spoke with the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses painting their son's actions as mere manipulation. This encounter, fraught with the tension of 'simple' disputes, set me on the course toward social work, a calling to aid those ensnared in familial strife.\n\nSocial justice stands as another pillar in the field of social work. In our society, we exalt the individual and lament those who slip through our grasp. Yet, this notion of the individual often bows to antiquated traditions rather than true singularity. If society mourns the lost, why then do we strive for sameness? I walk this earth as my own being, unshackled by the chains of conformity. In my time at high school and college, I opposed injustice with every fiber of my being: my hair a canvas of unnatural hues, my attire a reflection of self, my ears adorned beyond convention, my voice loud in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), my stand firm against racism and discrimination wherever they dared to show their face. I believe in the fight for social justice and vow to continue my protest against its absence.\n\nAnd so, with each step forward, I carry these truths with me, a testament to the path I aspire to walk, a life dedicated to the service of others, to justice, and to the betterment of the world around me.",
            "The paper you hold is a discourse on the models that bind insomnia to the biological and the sociocultural realms. In the biological sphere, the threads of genetics and the medical weave hold their sway. The sociocultural, in its turn, casts its eye upon the bonds of environment, peering into the depths of race, of ethnicity, of the very fabric of society itself. This review, it dares to uncover, to lay bare the models, to dissect the very heart of the research that lends them voice. In the findings, strengths are revealed, weaknesses too, each one unmasked in the cold light of critique.\n\nA disorder of sleep, it is said, can be known by its kin: a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or yet another tied to the body or the bane of substances. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias claim their place in this pantheon. Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, those that warp the breath in sleep, the rhythms of the circadian, and those that stand unnamed. Insomnia, it holds sleep at bay, while Hypersomnia battles to keep the eye unshuttered, both for the span of a month. Narcolepsy, the thief of wakefulness, brings cataplexy and the dream that comes unbidden. The Parasomnias, they walk in the night, bringing nightmares, terrors, movements of sleepwalking, and more that elude the tongue’s grasp. The disorders they link to the mind's troubles, Axis I and Axis II, they too are part of this tale. And so this review draws its focus on insomnia, and the primary disorders of sleep, through the lens of biology and socioculture.\n\nThe biological model, it speaks of genes, of inheritance, of the body's own tale in the disorder of sleep. The neurons, the orexin they bear, lie in the hypothalamus, guardians of the cycle of sleep and waking. The study, it took mice as its muse, and found phenotypic GABAB receptors on those neurons of orexin, bearers of the sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when roused, it calls forth sleep. If its fire is quenched, anxiety flees, and sleep is welcomed. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, it lengthened the sleep of the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, a tale is spun that the mice may yet tell of human sleep. Here is seen the intertwining of genes and the world without, in the GABAB receptor of the human kind. A flaw in this receptor’s tale, and sleep may be lost without the aid of medicine. The sociocultural thread, it whispers of inheritance, of phenotypes guiding sleep, and the twisted tale of a receptor marred. It speaks of the shadows cast upon life, upon learning, upon labor, upon the endless tasks of the day when focus is adrift.",
            "He'd been a student there at University Park for what seemed like the turn of two and a half years, or perhaps four and a half semesters if one reckoned by the calendar of the school. For many who roamed those grounds, himself among them, the very act of moving from place to place was a burden. In that first year they'd placed him in an East Halls dormitory, a place far flung as if it sought to escape the bounds of the campus altogether, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center beyond. The journey from his abode in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning at Willard, which lay nearer the heart of the grounds, could consume a good twenty-five minutes by foot. And that on a day when the skies did not conspire against him, as they so often did in State College. An older alum, not many seasons ahead of him, had spoken of a time when those dorms were cut off by vast stretches of barren land. Now that space had been claimed, filled with fields of sport, towering edifices like the new Creamery, and buildings for health, and all circled by apartments like sentinels. As the campus swelled, the struggle to navigate it grew ever more profound. What remedy for this ailment of movement? A simple thing it seemed, the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone was no panacea. It required the will of students to ride and a campus shaped to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend who had taken up bicycling once more after some years' neglect. The friend mused aloud, baffled by his own abandonment of such a noble steed. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said. \"For a while, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the sole way to traverse this place.\" For the body it was a boon, and for travel, unmatched in its efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some sweat of the brow and a man could cover thirty miles or more. Like many drawn from the dormitories, he now dwelled off campus, no nearer the center than some halls of residence. This year, he'd made the wise choice to purchase a bicycle. Each day brought him to Thomas building, an easy twenty-five-minute walk if he let his legs decide the pace. Yet with the bicycle, he could cut that journey to five if he pushed the pedals hard. But there was Pollock Road, the most direct path, and not always an easy passage, be it on a bike or on foot. Walking had its own merits, true, but time was a luxury he could not afford. Without that bicycle, he'd be bound to walk, and that daily trek would steal another thirty to forty minutes from his hours. Over a week, he'd be losing more than two and a half hours. And more yet if he counted the other journeys to classes and appointments and such. Time he could ill spare in the days allotted to him.",
            "In the somber landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the specter of technology looms large, its great shadow cast by the capitalist machinations that bind it. Here lies a world where the community smothers the individual, and the pursuit of fleeting happiness is a creed whispered into the ear from birth. A populace molded into pawns, their lives governed by the unseen hand of the World Controller, their thoughts tethered to a single dogma. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one might discern Huxley’s deep-seated wariness of these burgeoning constructs. Terms born of Marxism—homogeny, reification—dance through the narrative, underscoring Huxley’s critique of the economic tides of his era.\n\nThe satire of capitalism unfurls in the guise of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that cloaks the masses from understanding their true standing among the economic strata. They are ensnared by the lure of personal gain, their sight blinded by the ideological chains that bind the proletariat and laborers, mirrored in the conditioning suffered by the denizens of Huxley’s world. The Deltas, the Gammas, each class stripped of will, their minds reshaped by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to revel in excess as ordained by the World Controller. The grip of hegemony encircles them, a specter of domination wherein the lower classes remain oblivious to their own subjugation, buying into an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism. The Alphas and Betas, birthed with the awareness of their bondage, remain inert, save for the few like Bernard who dare to question. The dance of social classes, a tapestry of oppression under the capitalist yoke, unfolds with stark clarity.\n\nIn this world, the ties that bind disparate souls unravel, the novel refusing to grant its characters the nuance of depth. Huxley’s hand perhaps suggesting that the ascent of technology and capitalism strips man of his soul and voice. Love is a phantom, and emotion a shadow—interactions rendered shallow, as men speak of women in terms of their pneumatic allure, and women recount their liaisons with unabashed candor. The complacency of each class in their societal rung echoes the economic tendrils of capitalism. Their unyielding allegiance to their role within the hive mind mirrors Marxist insights into the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy so long as they consume, adhere, and march in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC. A class filled with voices rising and falling over a single question that seemed to stretch beyond the walls of the room: Is Islam a hostile religion? Such a question now, in these days, seems more pressing than ever. From the shadows of 9/11, I have watched the media's gaze shift. Once, it looked upon Islam with fear, with suspicion, but now it seems to have swung to a strange patience, a tolerance not easily understood. Hard to imagine in those days of 2001 that a man like Barack Obama, bearing a name tethered to a Muslim lineage, could stride into the arena of presidential ambition.\n\nThe Prophet's life, in its telling, intrigued me. A biography that seemed to run against the grain of what I had come to know of Muhammad. I had thought him a man who bent others to his will, who took tribes and made them kneel to the creed of Islam. Yet, in those pages, he was cast anew, a martyr misunderstood, humbling himself before others, the truth of his teachings drawing the people to him one by one.\n\nThere are lines drawn between the stories of Jesus and the so-called miracles of Muhammad that are difficult to ignore. In the tale where he multiplied mutton and milk until forty men had eaten their fill, I see an attempt to paint him as a prophet who walked in truth and miracles, needing nothing more to prove his worth. It feels a theft, a shadow cast over the light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to weave the life of one into the fabric of another's legend.\n\nThe biography is threaded with tales that speak of conversions, of witnesses coming to the truth of their own accord. Yet these stories seem spun from hearsay, tales told by those who heard from another and another still. It is a thing that sits uneasily with me, for while it seeks to stand as proof, it leaves a shadow of doubt, a whisper of suspicion.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the way they lift Muhammad, setting him upon a pedestal as a man of divine grace, humble and wise. Yet history casts another light, one that tells of a rise to power that speaks little of gentleness. I wonder if those who follow him today know this history that lies beneath the surface of his story.",
            "In the twilight of beliefs where the gospels were first whispered, the teachings of Jesus lay like stones in a streambed, unmoved and unheeded as the waters of Christian thought rushed past in their ceaseless journey. With the passage of time, the river of faith meandered, leaving behind the roots that anchored its beginning. Through the ages, you can see the world of Christianity diverging from its primal path, like travelers who have lost their way. Yet now, in the looming present, there is a rumbling beneath the earth, a stirring of the spirit that speaks of return. The old ways hold firm like ancient oaks in a restless forest, but the winds of change are strong, and they whisper of a coming day when history shall turn upon itself. \n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will find themselves drawn to the echoes of their faith's origins, yearning to strip away the layers of doctrine that have gathered like dust upon an ancient artifact. This slow revelation will be as inexorable as the tide, a movement that pares back the centuries until only the essence of Jesus’ message remains, unmarred by the hands of time. Across the lands of America and Europe, the faithful will rise like shadows at dawn, seeking a purer communion. The church will stand as a bastion, guiding the faithful back along the path to where it all began. With every step retraced, the myriad voices of Christendom will meld into a single chorus, the discord of division fading into a harmony of belief.\n\nHistory is a wheel that turns upon itself. Once, Christians were hunted and scorned by Rome, yet Rome became the heart of their faith. The land of freedom bore the scars of bondage, only to see those once shackled rise to lead it. In the days to come, this great wheel will turn again, drawing the threads of Christian faith back to their source, unraveling the tapestry of differences woven through the ages. This unraveling will not be of violence but of understanding, as the words of Jesus are read not as stone-carved edicts but as the poetry of metaphor. \n\nLook back far enough, and you find the roots entwined deep in Judaism, that ancient soil from which the sapling of Christianity grew. The Romans came, and the Jewish people split like a tree into branches, each reaching toward the sky in its own way—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the quiet multitude. These divisions were the seeds of what would become, yet from them all grew the solitary figure of Jesus, whose message would one day call the faithful back to the beginning, where the river first began its course.",
            "In the shadowed labyrinth of Packingtown, where the sky itself seemed to be a canvas for the soot and ash of ambition, there lay the stark truth of mankind's naked avarice. The Jungle, Sinclair's bitter ode to the industrial age, unveils the primal greed that festers within the human soul. A world where men look only to their own gain, their eyes cold to the plight of those trampled beneath their relentless ascent. Here the factory owners, lords of smoke and metal, wrought their empire with a callous disregard for the lives consumed in their furnace of progress. The great chimneys rose like obelisks, their plumes of smoke a testament to the sacrifice of the earth and its creatures, a sacrifice unheeded by those who reaped its spoils.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the great machine, were held in thrall to a merciless whim. For a dollar, they were bound, their worth measured in coin and not in flesh. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair writes, a world where loyalty is a forgotten relic and decency a ghost. They toiled under a sunless sky, the hours long, the reward scant, and at the end of the day, the axe could fall without warning, casting them adrift into the night. In this grim epoch, the law was a specter, the worker's guardian absent, and the factories a wilderness where only the strong or the cunning survived.\n\nYet, beyond the din and clamor, there was a deeper silence, a silence of souls worn thin by the grindstone of survival. The unions, a false beacon, often preyed upon the very men they claimed to shield, their coffers filled from the pockets of the poor. The men of Packingtown were bound by chains unseen, their lives a cycle of endless toil, their cries swallowed by the great maw of industry. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign,\" Sinclair laments, \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" In this wasteland, morality withered, and the human spirit lay shackled, as inevitable and pervasive as the very smoke that blotted out the sun.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature's past, where the echoes of great minds linger, Edgar Allan Poe whispered of a land beyond the veil of dreams. \"Dream-Land,\" he called it, a poem he held close to his heart. In its verses, the name \"Thulé\" surfaces, a name that Virgil once uttered, conjuring visions of an island far north of Britain, a place where the world as known faded into the unknown. Virgil's mention was sure, yet Poe's fascination with the works of German minds was a thread that wove through his own creations.\n\nThere, in the shadows of his words, lay a connection to Goethe, a titan of German letters. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings upon Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" saw the mirrored lines and drew a line from one to the other, whispering of imitation. Goethe, whose name graced the pages of the Oxford Companion to English Literature, stood as a colossus, his \"Faust\" a gem of poetic drama, unfolding in two acts—the first in 1808, the second marking the twilight of his life in 1832. Within this epic tale, nestled like a secret, was a poem of a king named Thule.\n\nA king who clutched a goblet, a gift from his departed queen, and in his grief, drank deep from its depths. In his sorrow, he cast the goblet into the sea and, with eyes closed to the world, followed it into the eternal night. The king's tale, a mirror darkly held to Poe's own struggles and losses, perhaps echoed in the land of dreams Poe traversed. Faust's tale found a new voice in H. P. Grattan's romantic drama in 1842, a whisper away from Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where \"ultima Thule\" found its place.\n\nIn Poe's collected words, Thule emerged twice, a haunting refrain. In \"Dream-Land,\" it framed the poem, a land of shadows where dead friends walked and colors fled. It mirrored Goethe's king, bereft of his queen, lost in a world without light or life. The two, Poe's vision and Goethe's lament, walked side by side, a dialogue across the pages of time.\n\nGoethe, a figure Poe would have known, if only for the echoes of Tennyson's admiration. When Poe spoke of Tennyson, the respect for Goethe was an unspoken bond. The world of letters knew Goethe's works, their reproductions spreading like wildfire, and Poe, ever the seeker, would have found them in the dim light of his study, the ink still fresh upon the page.",
            "In the dim corridors of law and consequence, the question arises. In the state of California, where the sun bakes the land and the law intertwines justice with the unpredictable hand of fate, can a soul wounded in body and spirit from a fall on an errant spill of applesauce in a grocery's aisle seek retribution beyond mere compensation? Can they claim the punitive with whispers of malice against the one who turned a blind eye twice to the hazard that lay there unheeded, left alone for the half-hour it takes to finish a meal?\n\nThe judge, a figure carved of patience and deliberation, would be hesitant to sweep aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To cast her claim in the iron of justice, she must lay bare the evidence that the overseer's deeds were done not in ignorance but in willful defiance of the harm that lay just beneath the surface, like a serpent in the grass. She must paint his actions in hues of darkness, despicable in their neglect. Palmer can stand before them and weave her tale, that the keeper of the store should have known the peril of leaving a spill untended, for in the months before, others had fallen victim to the same fate, their stories not unlike hers. Yet he turned away, his back to their plight. Her tale of his despicable disregard, though less forceful, finds its strength in the history of six others who had fallen before her, in that same year of trials, and still he chose inaction.\n\nThe clock marks the day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five in the evening. Rich Wayne, a humble worker of D&D Markets, bore witness to the spill and sought his superior, Paul Martin, who was then at table, breaking bread. Martin, wrapped in the cloak of indifference, dismissed the concern with words that echoed his disregard, speaking of his meal and the lack of time for the troubles of patrons. A quarter of an hour passed, and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan, spoke the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his negligence, echoed his prior dismissal. As the half-hour turned its course, Palmer found herself lost in the applesauce, her back caught in the gravity of neglect. Five others before her had met similar fates in that year at D&D's door. Now she seeks justice, both to mend her body and to punish the careless hand.\n\nIn the realm of California's statutes, one may claim punitive damages when a breach arises not from the bonds of contract but from a more sinister place, where oppression, fraud, or malice dwell. The law, etched in the annals of time, speaks of malice as a deed done with intent to harm. Absent such intent, it must be a deed despicable, wrought with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts, bastions of reason, have named actions malicious when done with a knowing shrug at the danger they pose, when the actor saw the storm coming and chose to stand in its path. Such is the measure of malice in the eyes of the law.",
            "She'd always been searching for something in the quiet hours of her life. A yearning that lingered like a shadow since she was fourteen, just stepping into the turbulent world of adolescence. Three years had passed and still the ache remained, a constant whisper in the back of her mind. She reckoned it was not a thing she sought but a person, yet no boy caught her interest. They courted her in their clumsy, adolescent way, but she found no appeal in their fumbling attempts. She puzzled over this strange absence of desire, pondering what made her different from the other girls. The years had spun out possibilities, none of which satisfied her quiet inquiries. So she moved through life, a question unanswered.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents, quiet souls who rarely raised their voices in anger, found little to dispute with their daughter. Their only tiffs arose from her declarations of independence, her insistence on her own path. Hers was a spirit lively and bright, a counterpoint to their calm demeanor, endearing her to those who crossed her path. \n\nBut today the peace was shattered. As she moved through the house, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry pierced the air. Her mother's voice, once melodic, now sharp with pain. Fear gripped her as she raced to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain drawing short breaths from her lips. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came squeezed and hurried, the anguish clear. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and the daughter, grateful for her strength, hoisted her up. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic smells and quiet dread. But her mind was fixed on her mother, blocking out the rest. She bore her inside, calling out for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched in their lines. A bed appeared and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for immediate care, while the daughter was left to worry alone.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf, and now the daughter sat with her thoughts, waiting in the sterile quiet.",
            "In the long corridors of human inquiry, one study set its gaze upon the Mediterranean Diet, a regimen born of sunlit groves and blue waters, where olive groves whisper secrets to the sea. The scholars sought to find if this diet, in its alternate form, with its score that marked adherence, could indeed ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and the silent approach of stroke. This aMed diet, as they named it, diverged from the traditional path, placing greater faith in the bounty of plants, the quiet strength of plant proteins, the soft whisper of monounsaturated fats over the harsh tones of their saturated kin, and the gifts of the ocean. It held back from the excesses of flesh and fat and allowed for the gentle tide of alcohol in moderation.\n\nThe annals of past studies spoke of the Med diet’s power to stave off the finality of cardiovascular demise, and an intervention proclaimed its superiority over the low-fat path, in guiding the weight-laden to lighter shores and taming the unruly tides of cholesterol. Yet, the shadow of stroke had not been their focus.\n\nThe study wound its way through the lives of 74,886 women, aged and unscarred by the diseases they sought to avoid, nurses all, who dwelled across eleven states of this vast land. Six times, from the year 1984 to 2004, they turned in their accounts of what they consumed, each morsel and sip etched into the record. The diligence of these women was near unwavering, with more than ninety-five percent remaining faithful to the study’s call across two decades. The truth of their reports was tested against the hard facts of medical records and the finality of death certificates, carving out a path of certainty in a world of probabilities.\n\nThey watched these women, calculated their body’s measure, their habits of smoke and aspirin, of vitamins and hormones, and from 1986, their leisure pursuits. They sought to smooth the rough edges of random chance, averaging the diet scores to better reflect the truth of years lived. They adjusted their sights for confounding factors, those tricksters that might lead them astray.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard models, they peered at the ties between diet and disease, separating the fatal from the nonfatal in their quest for clarity. They found that those who embraced the Mediterranean way, with scores that reached the heights of the aMed scale, faced a lesser risk of heart and mind’s betrayal. Across the span of twenty years, the numbers gathered: 2391 incidents of heart's affliction, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths of cardiovascular ilk. Those at the pinnacle of the aMed scale bore a risk far diminished, a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those at the scale’s nadir.\n\nThus, in the twilight of the study, the words were spoken: the Mediterranean way, in its alternate guise, stands as a sentinel against the ravages of heart and stroke.",
            "Hitler alive in Burma, the sign declares. \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a street corner, her cardboard placard raised aloft, a stark message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, a land by another name called Myanmar, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta, its power seized in the coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to protests unseen for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes led these uprisings, a revolution named for the hue of peace they wore. The populace soon followed, and though the junta permitted the monks their assembly at first, violence soon reared its head. Monasteries fell to the military's wrath. Foreign journalists were seized, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, met his end on the streets, a casualty of presence. Official accounts claim thirteen souls lost, yet Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army days before, spoke of a toll in thousands, bodies uncounted, unspoken.\n\nSuch tales are old as time. A government's iron grip, its need to silence dissent, is a shadow etched across history’s pages. Emperors of Rome named themselves chosen by deities to rule unchallenged. In Japan, emperors claimed divine descent, destined to lead through the making of cell phones and ritual death. The president of our time, George W. Bush, finds counsel in weekly calls with Ted Haggard, a leader of fools under the Republic Party's banner.\n\nThe world knows these tales. Tiananmen Square in the June of 1989, where scholars and workers and the young stood against their rulers, and the numbers of the dead lost in the fog of conflicting tales. Rwanda in the 1990s, where Hutu militias with the government's aid wrought genocide upon the Tutsis and moderates alike. And Hitler’s Third Reich, spreading darkness across continents, where Jewish lives were taken in the thousands, an atrocity among the ages.\n\nSuch shadows, ever lingering.",
            "In the dim glow of a smoky room where the notes of jazz hung heavy like the wreaths of smoke that curled and twisted about, there sat Duke Ellington at the piano. His fingers, delicate and sure, touched the keys with a subtlety that seemed almost an afterthought amidst the elaborate tapestry of sound he wove with his orchestra. An orchestra shaped by time, by the honing of talent and the forging of a singular vision that was Ellington's. In the compositions laid before him, his presence was a whisper, a shadow. Yet it was as a composer he truly sang, crafting pieces of such richness and complexity that they stood as monuments to the prowess of each band member. He was the architect of a musical landscape where soloists could roam, improvisations unbound, against a backdrop of meticulously orchestrated passages.\n\nEllington understood the voices of his musicians, each a unique brushstroke on his canvas, and it was this mastery that allowed him to conjure sounds both coherent and original. His compositions were a testament to this understanding, marked by innovation and brilliance that would ripple through the annals of jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s sound, of Creole Love Call where the voice was not mere words but an instrument, a texture, a color. It was in this piece his genius shone, as he complemented the soloists' style, a thread through the fabric of his career.\n\nThe slow, deliberate unfolding of Creole Love Call in twelve bar blues, six choruses, each a story unto itself. The voice and reeds in call and response, the trumpet muted and blue, the clarinet soaring with syncopated piano whispers, the full band echoing, the climactic swirl of reeds and brass, the voice growling, the trombone’s dissonant farewell. Here was Ellington, weaving voice into the very soul of the music.\n\nA year passed and in Hot and Bothered, Ellington’s ear for tone color found its match in tight orchestration, in the dance between “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat, a conversation in sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) bore witness to these ideas stretched further, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s trombone muted and melodic, the melody a thread that tied it all together. These were the sounds of Ellington, a legacy in jazz’s long, winding road.",
            "In the silent hours when questions of change whisper in the dark, we find ourselves asking just why creatures shift and mold as they do. What unseen hand guides their becoming? A century has passed since D’Arcy Thompson mused on the mathematic's reach, and yet the mystery holds. Today, new equations seek to unravel the shell's secret. In the realm of Prunum's form, we delve, threading numbers through its ancient spirals, hoping to seize the ghost of change itself. \n\nWith X-rayed eyes, we search the bones of Prunum, seeking the shape's truth. Quantities become keys, unlocking doors to shells that might be or have been, their forms cast in the digital ether of CerioShell. Alongside the hands-on craft of experiment, these spectral shells speak of the great dance of evolution in their stony silence.\n\nConsider the shell: a spiraling journey through time, born from the deep axis of its own becoming. Whorls grow like whispered secrets, each turn a chapter in the tale, bound by the suture’s line. The last whorl, body and breadth, tells of the end's beginning. The spire lifts its apex to the heavens, while below, the base anchors its tale. Through the aperture, life reaches out, touching the world beyond its carapace.\n\nThe shell in its manifold faces—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a new world. To count the whorls is to trace the shell's life from the start, marking the suture's first breath. From that line, quarter by quarter, the tale unfolds.\n\nSee the shell not just as structure but as story. A path traced through the ether, the aperture’s journey marked by the passage of days, the growth of an unseen hand. Plotted in space and time, the shell’s tale can be told in numbers. And with those numbers, a new tale begins to form, a mollusk's life rewritten through the lens of math and mind.",
            "The numbers tell a tale of stasis. In Indonesia, the breath of the newborn and the pulse of the infant linger in a place unyielding, unbroken by the sun or the passing of shadows, for the span of a decade. The nation strides toward certain goals, the water and the sanitation, they say, but the mothers and the children, they wait, their dreams unmet, the year of 2015 a forlorn beacon. The reasons are many, tangled like roots beneath the earth, and speak to a need for strength in the system, not the fleeting balm of isolated interventions.\n\nIn the realm of birth, there is progress, if it can be called such. A skilled hand at 72 percent of births, though the term skilled is stretched thin, including those who know not the ways of medicine should the fates turn against the mother. Hemorrhage claims them still, the blood a testament to the gap between what is and what should be. The numbers deceive, for the truth remains, a truth that demands more than has been given. The children, too, suffer, with fewer seen by a healer's eye when struck by the scourge of diarrheal disease. The care after birth is a haze, incomplete, a concern that stretches across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife that saves, the cesarean, is wielded too rarely, at 4 percent where it should be more. In the city, it is seen more often, but in the fields and the hills, only 2 percent know its edge. A country divided, access a privilege of the city, the wealth, a chasm between those who have and those who have not. The poor walk a harder road to the healer's door, their pockets lighter, the cost a barrier that looms large.\n\nThe path forward is a question, a question of how best to mend what is broken. Is it a matter of programs, each a spear aimed at a single target, or should the foundation be strengthened, the whole given the attention it needs? The allure of the program is strong, its goals clear, its results quick as a hawk's strike. But the dangers are there, too, the risks that one focus draws away the lifeblood from others, as has been seen with the call of HIV/AIDS drawing away from family planning. The programs run parallel like streams uncoordinated, leading to a flood of forms and papers that drown what they seek to aid.\n\nThese are the choices, the paths before us in the dim light of the present.",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has unfurled like a tapestry of myriad hues and textures, each thread a genre unto itself, so tangled and vast that one might lose themselves in the mere naming of them. And yet, within this labyrinth, the seed of a singular creation has given rise to a multitude of branches, each one a sub-genre reaching out into the dark unknown. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal stands like a colossus, its form and nature shifting across the years, becoming both a mirror and a shadow of the human soul. It is a genre that speaks in tongues of fury and despair, a cacophony of emotions drawn from the night’s darker palette.\n\nHeavy Metal is a chameleon. Born of a time when the world sought to break from the shackles of convention, it grew in breadth and depth, its roots spreading wide as artists discovered its boundless potential. It became a tree of many branches, each branch a sub-genre, and then those branches bore smaller branches, sub-sub-genres, until the tree was vast and its identity elusive. In this tangled forest of sound, what once was called Heavy Metal is now a question with many answers, a chimera of borrowed themes and borrowed voices.\n\nTo understand this beast, one must trace its lineage and delve into the heart of the movement. Metal is more than a genre; it is a force, a movement that sweeps through the world, defined by its darkness. It is a music of excess, where the bass rumbles like distant thunder, where the volume is a tempest, where violence and theatrics are woven into its very fabric. It is a place where musicians wield their instruments with the precision of a surgeon and the fury of a storm. Metal is born of a time when the air was thick with the haze of psychedelic dreams, a time when madness was a muse and otherworldly visions were set to sound. It is a music that speaks of the abyss, a visceral language new to the ears of those accustomed to the light.\n\nFrom this dark wellspring emerged songs like \"Helter Skelter,\" a harbinger of the metal to come, a dark echo from the Beatles not unlike the shadows thrown by the Rolling Stones. A challenge, a proclamation that they too could summon the weight of the world’s shadows into song. Thus did they etch their mark upon The White Album, a testament made in sound and fury.",
            "Long before the Surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions, both in paint and in the quiet longing of his heart. The Dream, a work from 1910, stands as testament to more than the woman who gazes in wonder at a strange land conjured from sleep. It bears the weight of Rousseau's own yearnings, the painter's dream of recognition, of acceptance in the circles of artists and patrons alike. He wrestled with a dilemma as old as art itself: to follow the well-trodden paths of style for the validation of the art world, or to strike out into the wilderness of his own imagination. The Dream captures this struggle, a reflection of his life's pursuit.\n\nTo see this painting for what it is, one must know the man behind it. Henri Rousseau was born on a spring day in 1844, in Laval, a place nestled in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, found some measure of prosperity, though no such fortune awaited Rousseau in art's world. His journey began without the guiding hand of formal education, and for decades he served as a gabelou, a toll collector, though the name douanier, customs inspector, clung to him mistakenly. Grief visited his life early, with the passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him only his daughter, Julia. In painting, he sought solace, a new beginning amidst a sea of loss. Unlike the painters who cast the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of his own world, with dreams and hopes that mirrored those of his peers.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance is a thread that runs through his life. Unversed in the formalities of art, he came to it late, his work emerging in the shadow of more celebrated contemporaries. Recognition did not come easily or soon. It was only as Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's light flickered brighter. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of their contrast: where Matisse feared the banal, Rousseau sought the familiar, craving the approval of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn the end, The Dream is more than a painting; it is the tale of a man's soul laid bare, its colors and forms whispering of the path he chose, the dreams he dared to follow.",
            "In the quiet creeds of thinkers past and present, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. As if in the marrow of things a reason abides, waiting for the light. Keats whispered it in the lines of an urn, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" like a gospel for the earthbound, all they need to know and all they ever will. The knowing we carry is burdened by lessons learned and experiences lived, yet in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, there is a knowing that comes unbidden, unschooled. They speak not in commands but in whispers, tracing the outlines of a world where beauty and morality are not dictated but discerned. Our minds strive to explain the grace of a painting, the righteousness of an act, but fall short of prescribing what makes them so.\n\nIn the telling of art or morals, that essence slips through the fingers. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, where scholars speak of light and shadow, of time and place, yet these words cannot grasp the heart of her. Ask a man his favorite work and you will hear the telling pause, the something about it that defies the tongue. Art and morals, like stories, live beyond their telling, as O'Connor spoke, for a story holds what a statement leaves wanting. Describe a tale, and you miss what lies beyond, something that cannot be captured in the net of words. Ethics, too, eludes the grasp of speech, as Wittgenstein knew, for it is transcendental, living in the spaces between words. This something, this ineffable quality, it is the power that art and morality wield, the bridge between what is seen and what is felt.\n\nMorality and art, bound as they are, reach us at a depth beyond reason, a noumenal realm Kant named. They touch us in ways clear and yet unexplainable. In literature, the bond deepens, for in its pages dwell the moral fibers that weave through life itself. Like McKean said, literature stands apart, its moral core unyielding, as essential as breath to life. For life is values entwined, and literature calls to us with those values laid bare. It is in the telling of tales that we find ourselves, and in the finding, understand what cannot be spoken.",
            "In the gray dawn of Europe's heart, Germany stands unyielding, a land forged in the crucible of time, its culture a river flowing from the shadowed Alps of München to the distant shores of Kiel, where the Baltic whispers secrets of old world seas. This same current runs through Köln by the Rhine's timeless embrace, through the very core of Germany, until it reaches Dresden's Saxon soul on the banks of the Elbe. A culture so singular, borne from the loam of forgotten tribes and fractured realms.\n\nGermania, the ancient marrow of this nation, holds its name shrouded in the mists of scholarly quarrel. Tacitus, in his chronicles, spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore this name, their banners flying before the Gauls in battle's din. Caesar, that conqueror of old, first set the word “Germanus” into the annals of his Gallic conquests, borrowing from the Gauls to mark those fierce beyond the Rhine, warring ceaselessly with the tribes he had yet to subdue. The origin, a ghostly thing, whispers of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, while others claim it springs from the spear, the ger, or the shouts of battle, a garim, echoing through time.\n\nTacitus himself penned the tale of these people in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" casting them as unchanged, untouched by the mingling of races, fierce and true in their homeland of storm-ridden skies and unyielding earth. \"Who,\" he wondered, \"would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for this harsh clime, unless it were their blood's call?\"\n\nAnd so it was, not the Romans who sought Germania's embrace, but their reach extending, seeking the wealth of its soil, sending their legions to test the bounds of empire. But always they returned to their Rome, vast and sprawling, while the tribes of Germania grew, living at the empire's edge, trading their earth's bounty, their warriors marching under Roman standards, their eyes always cast back to the dark forests and the land that bore them. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise unfurls a tale of deception that, while beguiling in its utility, demands eventual renunciation lest one loses themselves in the masquerade. Yet, the shedding of such guises brings with it the chill of isolation, a casting out into the wilds of one's own making. Thus, the choice looms: self-preservation or the fragile tendrils of connection that bind us to the world. For some, the revelation of deceit is met with mere bemusement, but others find their pride wounded, the farce a bitter draught they are loath to swallow.\n\nThe entanglement of disguise with the reversal of gender roles weaves a web tangled with questions of identity. Why does one cloak themselves in the garb of another gender? Viola stands as a testament to survival, her donning of masculine attire a shield against the unknown perils of foreign shores: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse holds, yet it casts her adrift from the women who might offer solace, severing her from the sisterhood she might have claimed. Olivia, deceived by appearances, mistakens her for Sebastian and entwines herself in love’s folly: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, Viola grapples with the unspoken pull towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo those who tread the modern path, Twelfth Night offers a lens through which deception lays bare the hidden chambers of the heart. Olivia and Orsino, drawn into Viola’s orbit, must confront desires whispered yet unvoiced. Is Olivia’s affection for Cesario born of the guise of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth? Perhaps it is not so, for Olivia, in Shakespeare’s hands, might simply mirror those who judge by sight alone. Her swift turn of heart from Cesario to Sebastian, and the familial embrace of Viola, signal the transience of her affections: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the annals of time where men carved out empires upon the backs of others, the German dominion over foreign lands stands noted for its harshness, a brutality that bore witness in the blood and dust of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples beneath the unyielding sun of German South West Africa. Yet to account for an empire's breadth by a singular stroke is to ignore the variegated tapestry of its existence. The German colonial empire stretched across vast lands, each corner as unique in governance as the very soil it claimed. Within its borders, the efforts to educate were as diverse as the lands themselves. When the British took the reigns of German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year nineteen hundred and nineteen, they found a people not wanting for knowledge, their minds sharpened by the tutelage of those who came before. Praises were penned for German endeavors in Kamerun and other far-flung reaches where scholars wrote of the day's light cast upon eager minds. Yet South West Africa, the land now called Namibia, stood in stark relief against such tales. There, unlike the far fields of East Africa where schools rose at the hand of the state, the task of imparting knowledge fell to those of the cloth, missionary societies left to their own devices with nary a nod from the powers that be. Yet for the European children, there was no such lack. Resources flowed like a river to their schools, state-backed, well-ordered, and watched over with a keen eye. The echoes of these choices lingered long past the German's departure. Where other lands could boast of learned men, South West Africa remained a land where many had not touched the written word. The reasons for this divergence lie in a tangled web of social, political, and economic threads. This study seeks to unravel those threads, to gaze upon the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled from afar. The pages of history are filled with words on German colonial education, penned mostly in German in the early days when the empire still held its sway. These works sought to capture the essence of learning in those distant lands. Later, the English tongue took up the tale, comparing the ways of Germany's scattered territories and delving deep into their secrets. It was Cohen who spoke most clearly on the matter, casting his eye upon the schools of South West Africa and East Africa, laying bare the forces that shaped them. He spoke of the settlers, the many who called South West Africa home, and how their presence shaped that land's pursuit of knowledge. In the reckoning of Germany's holdings, South West Africa stood apart. Its climate, though kinder than some, bore the harshness of the desert. Yet by the year nineteen hundred and thirteen, fifteen thousand souls of European descent had made it their home, a number unmatched save in the more temperate climes of East Africa.",
            "In the annals of time, there stood two nations, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a dance of rivalry that spanned the breadth of fifty-seven years. From the year of 1836 to the dawn of 1893, a time when the world turned slowly on its axis and men measured their days by the rising and falling of the sun. It was a rivalry marked by blood and fire, by the clash of cultures and the unyielding grip of tradition. The high-water mark of this enmity came with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, hungry for land and power, bore down upon Mexico with the fury of a storm, wresting from its grasp Texas and the American Southwest. In those days, the earth trembled under the weight of armies, and the sky was darkened by the smoke of battles fought and lost. Yet, even as the dust settled, other skirmishes flared, like echoes of a distant thunder, until at last the storm abated, just before the first great war of the world.\n\nIn their struggle, these two nations were not alone. For across the vast expanse of the world, many lands have known the bitter taste of rivalry with their neighbors. Nations that share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the waves against a rocky shore. The United States and Mexico were no different from countless other rivalries that have arisen between nations bound by geography. David M. Pletcher once observed that only in Mexico and Cuba did there exist long-lasting American diplomatic problems. These lands, so close and yet so far, have always been rivals to the United States, even as other nations in the Americas found a more peaceful accord.\n\nReligion, that old specter, cast a long shadow over their relations. It was a rift as ancient as time itself, for throughout history, nations have been torn asunder by religious discord. Sally Frahm spoke of how, if in the twentieth century Americans stood against fascism and communism, in the centuries before, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy. It was an ideological struggle, not unlike the cold war that later gripped the world, but here it was not politics that stood in opposition, but the very soul of belief. The distrust grew deep, a legacy of the enmity between the English and the Spanish, inherited like a dark heirloom from their colonial pasts, a barrier to the peace both nations sought.\n\nDiehl and Goerts chronicled the disputes, seventeen in all, marking the years of rivalry like notches on a weathered staff. Most were born of the land itself, of territorial disputes and border raids, of bandits and outlaws who haunted the edges of civilization. These raids, like wolves circling at the edge of the firelight, were a scourge that persisted until both nations, weary of the bloodshed, brought forth their armies to restore order.\n\nBut as time wore on, as the sun rose and set upon the land, the rivalry began to wane. Mexico, bound by the chains of circumstance, grew dependent upon the United States in ways substantial and profound. In the twilight of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted, from the lust for land to the desire for economic influence, and the fires of rivalry cooled, leaving only the embers of what once had been.",
            "Fifteen years past, I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me, an affliction that crept in like a thief, leaving me bereft of the life I once knew. I was a nurse then, drawn to its call by a deep and abiding need for the safety that eluded my younger years. They would say, as if reciting a sacred verse, \"You'll always find work; folks will always fall ill.\" And so, though my heart leaned toward the pursuit of science or the written word—both, if fate allowed—I took up nursing.\n\nYet there I was, forty-six, unaccompanied, with nary a coin to my name and no strength left to labor. To this day, I remain shackled by disability, the years of Social Security dwindling my possessions to naught. I endure, but each day is a siege upon my spirit, a test of my fortitude against the chaos that now defines my existence. Certainty has fled my life, save for one truth: I could not have weathered these years without the steadfastness of family and the rare friend. Disaster, real and relentless, strips away the veneer of strength.\n\nLife, I have learned, holds no promises. Emergencies will come, like storms over an endless plain—some small, others vast. Preparation is a shield, but some tempests are too fierce to face alone.\n\nI see the folly in placing hope in a government bloated and frail, yet my wish is for Americans to find trust anew in one another—to relearn the ancient art of giving aid and asking for it, rather than retreating to solitary refuges of fear. The tales of rugged individualism that echo through our history—those are not what sustained our ancestors. It was compassion, respect, and shared burdens that carried them through the Rockies to distant shores.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. A kit for disasters, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheets of plastic with duct tape for sealing windows against unseen threats. Flashlights, batteries, candles in abundance, matches that defy the rain, and cans of sustenance. If you can, find a plot of land, raise crops, preserve what the earth gives you. It is wisdom, as is a stove that burns wood—but not if you dwell in a tower of brick and mortar.\n\nAnd while you gather these things, seek out your neighbors. Learn their faces, their stories. For in that knowing lies the true shelter against the storms.",
            "In the long stretch of the past, a prince emerged in a time now called the fifth or sixth century before the common era. He would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey, a renunciation of the earthly world that led him into the quiet light of enlightenment. From his teachings, a path took form, Buddhism, and among its adherents, the most orthodox came to be known as Theravada. This faith, now weathered with the years, stands upon the foundation of two and a half millennia. Yet, it bears not the same visage as it did in the time of its founder. In the land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada holds sway, they hold their water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks and layfolk gather in observance, a rite of meaning and mystery, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such things. These shifts run deep, from the rituals on the surface to the very heart of soteriology. Through time, the Theravada community, whether clad in the robes of the monastic or the garments of the lay, has seen its teachings bend and alter. Forces from without and within, at times hostile, at other times indifferent, have left their mark.\n\nIn speaking of these changes, we find ourselves often returning to certain ideas. There is the notion of forces, internal and external. Internal, those born from within the Buddhasasana, whether monk or follower. External, those that come from beyond the Buddhist fold. Hostile, those that seek to harm, born of dark views against the doctrine. Benign, those that neither wish to help nor harm, though they may do so unwittingly. These terms will weave their way through this tale.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the essence of the faith—the doctrines at the heart of Theravada. The seekers of this path find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma stands upon the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical truths. Within these notions lie Anatta—the absence of self, Dukkha—the suffering woven into the fabric of life, and Anicca—the impermanence that clings to all things. To see these truths is to step from the endless wheel of Sansara, the dance of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, as enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the rules of living. For the layperson, there are five precepts: to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the monks, the rules are more numerous, a stricter path. At the core of it all lie the four noble truths. First, the truth of Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, the truth that clinging is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering can find its end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim corridors of human interaction, culture stands as a silent arbiter, casting its shadow over every negotiation. It's an entity defined as much by the void of what it is not as by the form of what it is, a specter neither singular nor unyielding. It resists the simplicity of broad strokes, eschewing the stereotypes that seek to contain it like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" Such declarations, in their sweeping generality, fail to capture the deeper essence. A negotiator, wise to the world’s ways, must peer beyond such superficial veneers, deciphering the intricate dance of cultural attitudes that sway the discourse at the table.\n\nAs one steps into the embrace of a foreign culture, it mirrors back an image refracted through the lens of one's own, compelling comparisons to emerge unbidden. To glimpse the soul of another culture is a journey through history and prejudice, a path laden with understanding rather than judgment. One does not seek to reshape this entity but to accept it, to maneuver within its confines, especially when the odds tilt against them. In lands not their own, respect for tradition and belief becomes the compass guiding them through the labyrinthine barriers of culture, propelling the negotiation forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach extends beyond borders, weaving its threads into the very fabric of corporate realms. A nation’s companies forge their own cultural identities, each as varied as the landscape itself. Some demand the grueling hours of toil, others embrace the ease of a more relaxed rhythm. Dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices become the tapestry through which this corporate culture is revealed. Even within a single country, the diversity of thought and practice from one company to another—and within regions of the same company—forms a mosaic of human endeavor. For those cultures that seem less stratified, whose surfaces appear seamless to the outsider, such uniformity merely beckons a deeper exploration.\n\nValues, those unseen currents, are the lifeblood of culture, revealing the why of its being. In a land where saving face or communal harmony reigns supreme, a negotiator will not sully the honor of his kin to win at the table. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, swift settlement is not the prize sought. These truths must be reckoned with before the first words are spoken in negotiation. Yet, the canny negotiator delves further, seeking to know the soul of his adversary, for in that personal knowing lies the power to shape destinies across the table.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So begins Psalm 14, casting its shadow over the minds of men who dare to ponder the divine. It marks the threshold of St. Anselm's questing for proof of a God who holds dominion over the hearts of the faithful. In this journey, Anselm is not alone. Thomas Aquinas walks beside him, both seeking a truth as old as time. And here we are tasked to weigh the worth of their words, to find whose voice rings clearer in the halls of faith and reason. We start with the presupposition of their shared belief, the God of the Bible, for to stray into realms of differently shaped deities would be to lose our way.\n\nNow, consider Anselm, who turns the gaze inward. He whispers that the proof is not out there but within, not in the stars or the stones but in the corridors of the mind. God exists, Anselm contends, because we cannot conceive of Him not existing. It is a subtle and winding path he lays, one that can tangle the unwary in its logic. Yet, there it stands, a monument to faith, a knowing that does not demand the crutch of evidence beyond the self. It is a belief borne of the soul's quiet conviction, that gentle whisper of faith that needs no louder proclamation.\n\nContrast this with the voice of Aquinas, who seeks a God not cloaked in mystery but revealed through the lens of reason. For Aquinas, faith is the seed, but reason is the tiller of the soil. He stands on the firm ground of logic, offering proofs like beads on a rosary: motion, cause, necessity, degree, and order. Each stringing together a tapestry of reason where the divine is the inevitable conclusion. In his hands, belief becomes a structure, as sure and solid as the stones of a cathedral, where faith is not a leap into the void but a step upon the firmament of understanding.\n\nYet, as we look upon these two, each with their truths and their failings, we find that neither alone holds the key to the kingdom. They are but paths converging on a mystery that remains just out of reach, a God perhaps known only in the spaces between faith and reason, in the quiet after the words have been spoken, and the silence where the heart rests.",
            "In the great sweep of Fitzgerald's tale, a world unfolds where colors bear the weight of meaning, casting shadows upon the lives they touch. There's a subtle alchemy in how he pairs words, and within this alchemy lies the truth of his craft. The Great Gatsby stands as a testament to the way Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of hues, each thread a whisper of intent. Colors like gold, green, white, and gray march across the pages, each with its own litany of significance. White and gray, especially, take on the guise of uniformity, white the finer, more genteel, while gray speaks of age and decline. They appear first on the scene as Daisy and Jordan drape themselves in white, a spectral hue that clings to them like innocence lost. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's revelry, Tom in a white shirt as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine powdered milky white. Even the city itself, New York's lower stretches, becomes a chasm of white, while the names of Gatsby's guests turn gray upon Nick's list, the very ink fading. \n\nFitzgerald's world is one where the ordinary, the unremarkable, wears white and gray. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood was white, a pale echo of their past. The valley of ashes sprawls gray, cars and land alike, the Italian child on the tracks is gray, the dog-seller a gray old man. The weight of these words builds until they become a code, marking what is unimportant, what is uniform, and what blends into the background of life's canvas. Daisy, in her white dresses, appears not as a woman of flesh and desire but as an ideal, a dream Gatsby clutches in his heart. Her presence is a gray haze, a white roadster, a white dress in the moments before confrontation. Fitzgerald paints her in these colors, a picture of a world that is less about the living and more about the longing, the uniformity that stretches like the gray land beneath an endless sky.",
            "In the sun-drenched expanse of San Diego County, the earth yields its bounty beneath a sky that knows no harshness. Tomatoes ripen under the gentle gaze of the sun, citrus and leafy greens unfurl their leaves to the light, and the land gives forth squash and broccoli, herbs and tree fruits, peaches and lemons and berries, all in their time. The honey is sweet and the peppers burn with the fire of the sun. There is a market here, a place where the folk gather, yearning for the fruits of organic labor, where eggs and milk from untamed lands find their way to tables. The land itself, these organic farms, they are open to the wanderer, offering paths for those who seek the solace of nature, the sight of birds in flight. Here, a landowner might find the grace of government favor, might improve the earth itself, might open the soil to the feet of the curious, the seekers of knowledge and of profit. \n\nYet there is a price to be paid. To farm the land without the crutch of chemicals is to walk a harder road. The labor is fierce and unending, the hands weary from the toil of pulling weeds and battling pests, of feeding the earth in ways that nature intended. The losses are keenly felt, for the small farmer lacks the might of the great agricultural machines. Still, there are those who plant cover crops, who rotate the grazing of beasts, who pull the invaders from the soil to let the native flora breathe. Here, too, the landowner might seek the wisdom of others, to learn how to weave together the threads of profit and preservation.\n\nThis tale unfolds on a tract of land near Potrero, in the unclaimed reaches of San Diego County. Spanning 160 acres, it lies in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, where chaparral and oak woodland meet the grasslands brought from across the sea. It is a place of many species, some of which teeter on the brink, like the Stephens’ kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, may soon follow them into the annals of the endangered. \n\nThis land was once the domain of those who came before, the Native Americans, and later the cattlemen and sellers of cordwood who carved their lives from the earth in the waning years of the nineteenth century. It was a piece of an original homestead, perhaps grazed by cattle, perhaps the source of wood for the hearths that once burned in the night.\n\nIn this story, I took a parcel from a digital ledger of land, studied the ways in which a small farmer might find aid from the hands of government, might preserve the wildness of the land while seeking to draw forth its bounty. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model of what might be, should one choose to walk this path.",
            "In the world there exists a bond between brothers, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared breath. A bond that is unyielding and eternal, carrying within it the weight of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. Brothers know each other with a knowing that runs deeper than the marrow of their bones, each seeing in the other a mirror of himself. In moments of desperation, the true fabric of this bond is revealed, whether it be woven of good or evil. These emotions, when laid bare, come with a toll heavy and inescapable. To understand the emotions entwined within this fraternal connection is to bear the burden of their consequences. To meet a brother's gaze is to peer into the depths of one's own soul, stripped of the masks worn for the world. It is in their deeds and their aftermath that one's true nature is found. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the two brothers walk this path, navigating the tempest of emotions that accompany them. Amidst a landscape rich and alive, they embark on a journey doomed from the start. In the end, the bitterness of disappointment and the fierce heat of pride collide, and only one brother emerges from the storm. This theme is etched through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the interplay between them, as well as the narrator's perspective, which casts light on the tangled web of feelings within the protagonist and his perception of the world, both of which cast shadows on his actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's deeds lies the singular force of pride. From the first breath he shares with his fragile brother, Doodle, to their last, ill-fated odyssey, resentment simmers within him. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, to teach him to hold breath beneath the water, to run, to leap, to climb the vines twisting through Old Woman Swamp. He craved a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch beside him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle's frailty, his heart too weak to bear the weight of life, let alone the thrill of racing and climbing. It was a cruel blow to the young boy, his mind a cauldron of wild imaginings, to have those visions snuffed out in an instant. Anger stirred within him, dark thoughts of smothering the life from the small child flickering across his mind. What child, you might ask, would harbor such thoughts? But then, the simple curve of Doodle's smile breaks through, softening the hardness in his heart. Such a small act, yet it kindled hope within the boy. It showed that his resolve was but a fleeting shadow. Somewhere deep within, there was an instinctive love for his brother, a love that whispered in the dark corners of his mind.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a maze of intricate pathways lies sprawling, where thoughts weave and meander like rivers through the dust of time. Once, in the dawn of man's understanding, the brain was likened to a simple wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a tome of knowledge bound in leather and ink, and now to the cold machinations of a machine, ever calculating, ever processing. But these are mere shadows and reflections, pale imitations of the truth, and one must tread carefully, for they can lead astray.\n\nThe world enters the mind through the senses, those ancient gatekeepers who transform the touch of skin, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, or the light of stars into the language of the soul, a tongue of electrochemical fire. This raw tapestry is then spun and woven by the brain's algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Consider the image of a black box stark against a field of white; the bottom-up gaze gathers fragments of color and shape, marking the edges where darkness meets the light, and in this, finds a box. The top-down gaze, with the wisdom of steps taken before, might discern not a void but a solid shape, black as the night.\n\nThrough this complexity, an unseen hand, the attention filter, sifts through the noise and the chaos, deciding what shall pass and what shall fall away. It is why, among a sea of grass beneath your feet, each blade remains unseen, yet the call of your name pierces through the clamor of a crowded room, clear and true. The mind is a stage of unending acts, where attention is the director, guiding the play.\n\nBut before the mind can ponder, it must remember. Memory is the keeper of time, with chambers for the sensory, the fleeting, and the enduring. In the beginning, the world is etched into the mind, encoded in ways as varied as the senses themselves. A word can be known by its shape, its sound, or its meaning. Once etched, it is held in place, perhaps by the flicker of electricity through a web of neurons for the short-lived memories, or by the very structure of proteins for those that endure.\n\nThere are many who seek to chart this territory, some with the tools of science, others with the mind's own map, and still others through the study of the flesh itself. In the semantic network, ideas are stars in a constellation, each linked to another by the invisible threads of meaning. A chair to a table, a table to wood, and so the web is spun.\n\nAnd so it is, the mind, a great and terrible machine, ever turning, ever creating, a mystery that beckons and eludes.",
            "In the year of 2007, the United States found itself cast into a shadow of financial ruin. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market lay shattered, and the great titans of industry stood as hollowed shells upon the landscape of commerce. This recession, relentless and unyielding, marches on even now. And so we ask, how did this calamity come to pass, and what might we do to halt its advance? In the starkest terms, it was the folly of political minds, driven by self-interest and devoid of foresight, that compelled banks and firms to peddle subprime loans into a financial system not yet grown to withstand such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giants in the world of mortgages, were goaded into weaving these precarious loans into the fabric of CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers faltered, as they inevitably did, the banks found their coffers bare, and the chaos spread outwards, touching every corner of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this turmoil were sown in the twilight years of the last century, during the reign of Clinton. A President, eager to find favor and extend his grasp on power, loosened the chains of lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the disaster that would follow. It was Steven Holmes of the New York Times who wrote in 1999 of the pressure upon Fannie Mae to open the gates of homeownership to those of lesser means, a pressure that stemmed from both the administration and the hunger of shareholders for ever-growing profit. He saw with clarity the peril that lay ahead, predicting the need for a rescue akin to that which had come before in the days of the savings and loan crisis. And so it was that the reckless granting of loans would, as foretold, lead to the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe fabric of the financial world had become a tangle of complexity, as mortgages took on new and bewildering forms. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations wove together, binding more and more of the economy to the fate of the housing market. Households and financial entities alike found themselves overextended, standing precariously upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of fortune.\n\nThe bubble, of course, did burst, and those institutions that had wagered upon the solidity of these mortgage-backed securities were left to reckon with their folly. By 2007, the top five investment banks bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation’s economic output. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch found themselves sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs alongside Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the shackles of commercial banking, bound by stringent oversight. As for Fannie and Freddie, they were engulfed in a sea of $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and by September of 2008, they too were brought under the yoke of government control.",
            "The tale unfolds and there is a place where the words must bear the weight of the story. Stretching out like a lone hawk in the morning sky, hoping to capture the breath of those who linger on the page. Or else it is the place where the eyes grow heavy and the mind drifts away, leaving curses in their wake. Dr. Merlin, it is said, would growl at the screen when caught amid a deluge of needless words, not even of the entertaining sort.\n\nExposition, the betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThose who take kindly to the craft of writing know well the old adage, \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, Dr. Merlin finds herself entangled in long, barren passages where little stirs or too much overwhelms. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay the groundwork of history swiftly so the tale might move to brighter pastures (not to be confused with that other whisper, the one that tempts you to divulge every chapter of each character's past).\n\nExposition is the telling of what transpired, often laid bare in simple words. In the moving pictures, it is when one soul imparts to another a torrent of narrative, like some ancient mariner's tale. In the written word, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nTake this for instance. As you turn the pages of a story, you are told the maiden met her love in a certain place at a certain time, that they wed amidst splendor, and that he fell, slain, before her eyes. You would not reckon this tale to be spun in but two pages, with a mere scattering of their words. You would hope the writer would linger on the husband's nature, revealing through his voice and gesture the depth of his love, and you would expect the heroine to show, through the great and small, how his being in her life had transformed and enriched it (especially if the tale later claims this to be so). A rightful introduction to the husband would bind you to his fate and grant you insight into the woman he cherished: what she perceived in him, how their bond was forged, hints of her own musings and dreams as mirrored in his gaze, and so on. You would grieve his loss with her and thus draw closer to her very soul.\n\nIn essence, you would seek the marrow upon the bare bone of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a keeper of stories, it is upon you to provide that marrow. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, carries on*) There is often the urge to hasten over things unremarkable. You might bring forth a new character, knowing he once served in the Air Force, now oversees a gas station by night, wed twice, childless, a fisherman on lazy weekends, harboring a quiet hope to one day own that very gas station, and had Eggs Benedict to start his day.",
            "In the gray dawn of the day, the news flickered on the screen like a silent oracle, casting shadows of the world beyond. From Columbus, Ohio, the stories unfolded, each one a testament to the darkness that lay beneath the surface of our lives. The first, a tale of violence in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had turned his hand against his own flesh. His wife's name was a secret kept by the ether, but his face, captured in the cold eye of the camera, was a portrait of malevolence. The tale was brief, a mere whisper of the horror that had transpired, yet it lingered in the mind like a specter.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, whose life was hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods area, a place marked by the absence of justice. The SWAT team scoured the shadows for answers, but the silence was unbroken. The brevity of this telling, a reflection of a world where the color of one's skin determined the weight of one's story. The media, a fickle beast, often turned a blind eye to the plight of those whose skin was dark as night, their cries for justice swallowed by the indifference of the world.\n\nA gunshot, like a distant thunder, had marred the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet from a .22 caliber rifle the culprit. The promise of gold, five thousand dollars' worth, hung in the air for those who could unravel the mystery. The news moved on, swift as a river, to the coming storms, the promise of rain and thunder hanging over the city like a shroud, the temperatures a mere footnote in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThere was talk of a robbery, a dark-skinned man cloaked in a hooded garment, his presence described in detail, the color of his skin a note played over and again. The emphasis on his darkness, a reminder of the biases that ran deep in the veins of society.\n\nAnd then, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man from Texas whose life had been a dance with the devil of drugs. His fate sealed with a sentence of twenty-five years, spoken in the strange tongue of \"300 months,\" as if the weight of his punishment could be shifted by the turning of words. His heritage, Hispanic, was noted, though it seemed but a shadow in the grand narrative of his crimes.\n\nThe stories, like footprints in the ash, lingered in the mind, each one a reminder of the world as it was, a place where the past and present wove together in a tapestry of light and shadow.",
            "In the world of finance where shadows lengthen and figures shift, there exists a thing called an ETF. A creature not unlike an exchange traded fund, born to follow the trails of indices or commodities or a basket of assets. Like a wandering hound on the scent, its nature is fluid, trading as it does like a stock upon the open market. It bears within it the breadth of an index fund, yet clutches the singularity of a lone stock, offering the promise of short selling, buying on margin, and the purchase of a solitary share. These lures glitter like gold in the eyes of the seeker. The expense ratios of these ETFs are lean, far leaner than the average mutual fund, a siren's song to the thrifty. Yet, alongside these boons lie the thorns, for one must pay a commission as one would with any stock. There lies another promise in the wide array of funds, spread vast like the prairie. But the wise investor knows to tread with care, to discern if these proclaimed virtues like diversification hold true, and to what degree they do. Our gaze will rest upon the ETF known as IHF, setting it against the top ten holdings that form its backbone, seeking to unravel whether the merits of a single ETF compare to the bounty of a diversified collection of ten stocks, and if within the same stocks there lies a better arrangement, a sharper edge or return.\n\nTo weigh the worth of the ETF, it becomes a task too great to encompass every holding, and so we choose to focus on the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's essence. These ten stand as pillars, and their percentage of the whole is etched below.\n\nTo glean an understanding of how these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF in its entirety, we take their current share of the assets, normalized to a full circle, to determine the weight each carries in a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it made solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it emerges that a portfolio graced only by the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in the harvest. The Beta too is lighter, by .12, than that of the ETF whole. Thus far, it seems that a gathering of merely the top ten holdings might offer a richer return with a gentler Beta. Yet, there hovers the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not worlds apart in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different in the eyes of numbers, the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks is measured and set to a full hundred, to compare their collective deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "They saw the drop in the numbers of those who logged their journeys and it fell like a cold shadow cast across the third month of the endeavor. And there was no ready answer to the question why. Perhaps it was the winter's breath, chilling the bones of those who would walk or ride, a New England campus silent beneath its frost. Or it was the end of things, of semesters and the harried souls racing to finish what they had started, grades to be meted out like judgments in the cold light of December. The logs, forgotten perhaps, lost among the myriad tasks that beset them. And there was the coming of the season of festivities where the world turned inward and the campus lay fallow, its halls hollow and empty, a month-long slumber before the year's turning and the classes resumed. Thus, the logs lay scarce in February, a mystery unsolved. The fervor of beginnings had waned, the flame guttering, as such things do. And so there came the Carpool Challenge, a rallying cry to stir the hearts once more, a March campaign swift and bright and it did bring forth an increase, though the challenge remained as before, how to sustain the breath of life in this endeavor against the tides of indifference and the rhythms of the academic calendar.\n\nYet there was another truth, buried deep, the love of the open road and the solitary freedom it promised. The car, a symbol of independence, unyielding in its cultural roots. Incentives were offered, tokens of gratitude in the form of gift cards, small treasures for the weary traveler, to the local stores and cafes, a balm for the soul. But one wonders what greater prizes might have wrought, a bicycle perhaps, or the promise of a hybrid or electric car. These fantasies might have drawn forth those who hesitated, kindling a new fire where the old had waned. The prizes, unchanging, might have held more allure had they grown in worth with each passing month. To announce in the heart of December a grand reward would have surely quickened the pace of those who had grown tired. One can only ponder what might have been, had the stakes been raised and the call to action resounded more fervently amidst the cold and quiet of the year’s end.",
            "In the gloom of the Library of Congress, I found myself poring over the early Edison films, drawn to their trickery like a moth to a forgotten flame. Fifteen they were, from the dying whispers of the nineteenth century to the first murmurs of the twentieth. Films that played with the mind's eye, slipping reality through the cracks of the reel with a sleight of hand born of clever editing. My journey through these shadows aimed to uncover the poetic threads binding these films, and to sift through the dust for those rare gems that dared to step beyond their time-worn bounds. \n\nAt the turn of the century, most trick films were bound to their sets, framed by the rigid proscenium, the camera a watchful sentinel that never moved, holding fast to its creed of one shot, one film. Yet, there were those brave few that inched towards the dawn of a new era, introducing a dance of multiple shots that whispered of change.\n\nWhat they shared, these trick films, was a devotion to the interior, a stage where the camera stood steadfast. No pursuit of figures, no shift in view, for the lens was rooted in its theatrical past, echoing the vaudeville and magic acts that had preceded it. Movement was but a lateral waltz, a side-to-side glide with no venture towards the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors drift from the right, skimming the stage like ghosts, never drawing the camera from its fixed gaze.\n\nThe proscenium's embrace meant long shots reigned supreme, with medium shots as rare companions, and the intimacy of close-ups was a stranger. The theater's influence was strong, its essence distilled into every frame, where the audience's gaze was framed by the stage's boundary. Actors held their ground, neither advancing nor retreating, leaving the close-up an untapped well.\n\nIn those early days, trick films held to the notion that one conceptual shot was a film entire. A constraint that kept their tales brief, their magic confined to a minute's breath, dictated by the frames per second. Their narratives were simple conjurings, vanishing acts, and clever exchanges without the weight of story. Yet, within the illusion of a single shot, lay the hidden seams of multiple, stitched together to conjure apparitions. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). At first glance, a seamless vision, yet upon closer inspection, the moment of trickery reveals itself, the shift where Mary's severed head begins its deceit, though to the viewer, it remains a singular shot.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, where the past meets the present, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, an old-new amalgamation that Ian Watt has called an oxymoron in his exploration, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic spirit, like an ancient shadow, has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of shallowness yet revered for its terrible and sublime essence, as Burke once noted. The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole's creation, emerged from this twilight, a fusion of the ancient and the modern, carving a path for the Gothic genre, a new voice in the wilderness of literature. Walpole drew from the \"old\" theatrics and the 'new' mimicry of nature, weaving them into what he proclaimed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre borrows heavily from the medieval, a nod to the gothic theater, architecture, and traditions of yore. Even then, the word \"gothic\" was a ghost from many pasts, a descriptor for peoples, styles, epochs, carrying the weight of the archaic and the unsophisticated against the tide of modernity. It is this blend of the theatrical Gothic with the new novel's intimate lens on human psychology that has allowed the Gothic to linger through the ages, becoming both a relic and a revelation to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmidst these shadows, the notion of Chivalry rises, like a specter in the Gothic tales. This medieval code, the making of a knight, survives and transforms in The Castle of Otranto, that first Gothic novel. Chivalry held a mirror to the Gothic writers, reflecting the noble knight, brave and honorable, a mirror to what they believed was missing in their world. Through chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is painted in romantic hues, a wistful look forward to Romanticism, an endeavor to mend the present's fractures. Walpole, in the storm of political unrest, looked back at the noble silhouettes of history, despairing at the shadows of his own time. Engulfed in the political turmoil and accusations, his mind turned, perhaps unconsciously, to the lost moral compass and goodness of the Gothic age, absent in his society. This longing is etched in his characters, especially in Frederic, a figure of chivalry, whose reputation precedes him. Frederic steps from the pages, a prince forged in adversity, a tragic figure believed slain by infidels. His image is crafted with chivalric strokes, exaggerated in a way that heralds the Gothic's love for excess, a hallmark to come.",
            "In the bare bones of commerce lies the great machinery of supply chain management, an endless march of goods from the moment a customer dreams of them to their birth in the raw and unformed. It was in the early days of 1982 when a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant, named this stream of processes. He spoke of it as one might speak of a river, a flow of planning and executing and controlling the journey that goods must take, all to sate the needs of the waiting customer. Six are the pillars on which this chain rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers, like ancient alchemists, wield these elements to craft a service that meets the restless demands of those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first note in this symphony of commerce, stands as the bedrock of the supply chain. It is here that the questions of when and why and where and how ring out, echoing in the minds of those who must decide. The market, a fickle beast, whispers its demands, and the managers listen with intent, deciphering the wants of the masses. With their ears to this ground, they set about determining what must be made, and in what numbers. The place of creation is chosen with care, a factory or plant that promises both volume and quality, all in the pursuit of the customer’s satisfaction. Once the ground is laid, the managers turn their eyes to the scheduling of tasks and the upkeep of the machines that will bring their plans to life. In this meticulous dance, every step is crucial, for a misstep could cost dearly in time and gold. I have seen the inner workings of places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest detail is mapped, from the color of an employee’s shirt to the route a truck must take. Such plans are the lifeblood of a company, ensuring a smooth course free of confusion and discord.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, stands as a testament to the art of decision-making. Here, the strategic minds ponder the core strengths of their facilities, choosing partnerships for outsourcing that will bolster these strengths. In this complex web, a single product may owe its existence to many hands, each division a world unto itself with its own tools and craftsmen. The manager stands as a conductor, deciding which division will play which part, or whether another company should join the orchestra. The heart of this decision is velocity, the power to deliver speed and quality while keeping costs low, a feat much sought after in the halls of business.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of the Victorian age, where the light plays tricks on the eyes and the echo of footsteps is swallowed by the darkness, there are novels that step away from the gilded halls of aristocracy to wander in the terrain of the unknown. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, they are called. Each a vessel of mystery and the uncanny, diverging from the well-trodden path, their characters emerging from the shadows with motives laid bare by the fires of the bizarre.\n\nThe words came at him like a storm, a cacophony of voices and sounds that smothered the air around him. Between Sikes and Crackit he walked, their quarrel ringing in his ears, his own voice mingling with theirs in the fog of his mind. And then, the crack of gunfire, and the world erupted in chaos, a whirl of cries and lights that seared his vision as a phantom hand pulled him away. Amidst this tempest, a dull ache gnawed at him, relentless and unforgiving. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn such tales, the dream is a doorway, a passageway where reality bends and the soul's torment is laid out in stark relief. In Oliver’s world, dreams are a revelation of his inner turmoil, a canvas painted with the colors of his suffering and his awakening to the world’s cruel truths. Chapter 28 finds him immersed in the memory of gunfire, caught in a dream's embrace, seeking refuge yet finding none. The scene unfolds with a sense of helplessness, the grip of fate tight and unyielding. The specters of Sikes and Crackit haunt him, specters born of fear and powerlessness. He is swept away by forces unseen, his senses dulled, pain and dread entwined. Here lies the heart of Oliver’s struggle: the absence of agency, the chains of destiny that bind him, rendering him a passive witness to his own life's unraveling. The specter of Fagin looms large, a shadow cast over Oliver's spirit, whispering resignation into his ear, sapping the will to resist. For in these moments, the boy's struggle is not just with the world, but with the creeping despair that seeks to claim him.\n\nThe hours crept by - a day passed, if it could be called day at all, swallowed by the night that followed. Night stretched on, a silent eternity, yet fleeting in its passing, a passage through the void, the minutes fleeing like shadows from the light.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the halls of a school, an after-hours sanctuary for young minds, lending what aid I could to children finding their way through the murk of learning. My charge was to guide them, these small seekers, in subjects that gave them pause. My own strength lay in the words and the stories they told. Among them was a boy called Adrian, small of stature, perhaps third or fourth grade, facing a peculiar struggle with the written word. Some letters he grasped with ease, others slipped through his understanding like sand through fingers. It puzzled me, for he spoke the language with flawless clarity, though his heritage was Latino. We wrestled with the words until one day his mother came, speaking only in her native tongue, and the truth struck me with the force of revelation. The boy knew the words, but not the symbols of the language they formed. In that moment, a knowledge settled in me, and I could only hope it helped him find his way.\n\nThis tale I share not for its own sake but to lay bare the silent walls that rise in our schools, here in this sun-baked land of California. A barrier not of bricks but of tongues. It is a truth hidden in plain sight, that a child may speak the language and yet be a stranger to its written form. The question we must ask is not if this wall exists, for it surely does, but how we might breach it. For Adrian, a path lay in the letters and sounds that eluded him. Yet for others, those who know not the language of this land, the answer is not so simple. There is no solitary cure. The dual language, the immersion in the mainstream, the private guides, the classes of English as a second tongue—none alone will tear down this wall. It is in their union that hope lies.\n\nTo take the dual language path is to open doors not only for those whose first words were in the songs of Spanish but for all children. Such programs have shown their worth, their students rising above their peers. Yet fear shadows their implementation, whispers that they waste what cannot be squandered, that the many reap no reward. But these fears are unfounded. Were we to embrace such learning as common practice, all would find enrichment. The question remains, how? Must every teacher speak in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. Yet there is no reason we cannot place among them those who do, as aides or tutors, guides fluent in the languages of many.",
            "Since those first glimmers of awareness, the notion has been seeded in us that something larger, ineffable, stands beyond the edge of our understanding. Some are led to sit in pews and listen for whispers of the divine, while others search within, grasping at the shadows of their own souls. Many cling to the faith of their forebears, worn paths trodden by countless feet before them. And yet, there are those who turn their backs on such teachings, declaring their own small world the measure of all things. We may take up one creed only to cast it aside for another, as if the truth were a garment that could be changed with the seasons. Whatever road we walk, we strive to carve out a niche for ourselves, seeking the flicker of light that promises to guide us from the depths of night into the warmth of day.\n\nA cardinal, my father murmured, when I questioned him about his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming a relentless rhythm atop the tin roof, each of us with a cigarette between our fingers. The gutters spewed torrents, drowning the greenery that bordered the porch's edge. His gaze was lost in the rain, a look that seemed to drift between the past and some uncharted horizon. Over the months, he'd dwindled, his clothes hanging loose as though they belonged to another, his hair thinned like a memory fading. He kept his eyes on the rain, as if meeting mine would somehow anchor his spirit. I felt the silence between us, a chasm I dared not cross, for to speak of departure would make it so. I reached for him, drew closer, and together we watched the rain fall in the waning light of June.\n\nHe slipped away in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments had bought him time, though what worth was time when pain was its currency, I could not fathom. What deity, I wondered in the lonely dark, would weave such a tapestry of suffering? I found no solace in prayers spent on deaf ears, convinced that if God ever listened, He'd long since turned away.\n\nI could not bear witness to that final breath, the extinguishing of the life that had given me mine. I refused to see him as he waned, preferring the echoes of his laughter to the silence of his end. I knew him better than the others did, knew he would not want me there, watching as he drifted into the unknown. I folded myself into my bed and let the world pass by, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nBut no call ever came.",
            "In the shadowed expanse of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a figure carved from the very soil he tended. An advocate for Republicanism, his roots were deep in the land, an agriculturalist by nature and a man for whom the earth was both a canvas and a creed. His brief sojourn into the realm of politics did not temper his voice, one of outspoken fervor for the freedom of the individual and the restraint of government. His heart beat for the agrarian life, a rhythm that guided his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the courts that ruled the land.\n\nTaylor saw this young nation, the United States, as a blank slate, untouched by the ancient traditions that bound older lands. Here was a chance to craft an ideal, to birth a system where self-governance could flourish. He held fast to the notion that the rights of man were natural and intertwined, each reliant on the other. Deny one, and the whole would crumble, their worth diminished. Thus, these rights must lie beyond the grasp of government. In the state of nature, he said, it was the strong and the cunning who thrived, but civilization demanded a different order.\n\nTo forge this dream, Taylor knew a government must reckon with the dual nature of man, both virtuous and vile. He spoke of a dual morality, where every virtue and vice of governance was but a reflection of humanity itself. Good governance, Taylor declared, safeguarded private property, nurtured the land, and spurned the greedy clutches of capitalism. Such a government, built on principles true and just, would stand steady, even as those who led it succumbed to greed and self-interest. For Taylor, self-interest was the engine of man, only darkened when it bred societies that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant government was needed to chain man's inherent evil, ever watchful to exclude the bad.\n\nIn the company of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a document that, to him, should bind the Federal government in chains of explicit limits. He saw the sprawl of Federal power as a costly path to despotism. Yet he warned against a simple literalism, for without the spirit of the Founders' intentions, such readings could twist to corruption. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, for it spoke of sovereign states bound together, not as one monolith, but as a gathering of equals.",
            "He stood there, gaze fixed downward, seeing but not seeing, his mind a void that absorbed the view without judgment or understanding. The practiced eye of a man who had long since learned to separate the sight from the meaning, a mind that cataloged what it saw but refused to know it, thoughts slipping like whispers through the dark, as if they were not thoughts at all but a mere murmuring of experience washing over him with the ease of a brook over stones.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a moment of whim, he had taken the advice of an artist friend and bought a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. A book meant to teach one the art of seeing, of understanding the world through the tip of a pencil, through the lens of line and form. It spoke of frames, of ways to distill the chaos of the world—a bowl of fruit in the cluttered sprawl of a kitchen—into something simple, something graspable, a bowl on a table in a realm of its own.\n\nYet now, as he stood over the bowl before him, he found no such frame to enclose his sight. There was only the vastness of his awe, a vision too full to be contained. The masters had their colors—Picasso his blues, Monet his greens, those artists of old basking in their prismatic glory. But here, if there was to be any art to his vision, it was the art of brown. This was the canvas spread before him, the genesis of his own peculiar masterpiece.\n\nHis fingers settled upon the tool of his creation, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind finding shape in action. Water swirled beneath him, a dance of clarity and calm, carrying with it the fragments of what had been. Again his hand struck, more frantic now, commanding the handle with insistence. But still the stubborn brown form clung to the bottom of the porcelain, unmoved, defiant.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted firm, the tie at his throat a strangling knot of green. A slight frown creased his brow as he regarded the insolent mass left behind by some nameless soul—a message in waste for the weary keepers of the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, winding it round and round until his hand was swathed like some ancient embalmed thing. He straightened, then bent low, his hand descending into the bowl with the careful grace of a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving feast.",
            "The young ones are dying out there on the roads, a grim tally kept by fate and folly. This confluence of hazard, this grim conjoining of statistics, finds its root in the unready minds of the youngest among us. The National Institutes of Health tells a tale of brains not yet ripened for the perils of the road. Inexperience, too, sits heavy at the heart of this dark matter. It is this lack of knowing that leads them astray, to more deaths, to the rolling of vehicles, to the speed that sings of oblivion, to roadsides that catch them unawares.\n\nThey fare worse when traveling in packs, these youths, for they are wont to gather and ride, heedless of the danger. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has mapped the correlation between the age of those who sit beside them and the wreckage left in their wake.\n\nCalifornia and other lands have sought to mend this with temporary measures, provisional licenses that bind the hours of their travels and put a stop to the bearing of fellow minors as passengers.\n\nYet these provisional licenses are but a finger in the dam. The root lies deeper, for by all measures, these young souls are not yet fit to shoulder the burdens of the open road. Marvin Zuckerman, a student of the mind, speaks of eighteen as still too tender an age for such liberty. USA Today bears witness to his findings, the yearning of those not yet reached the age of nineteen, to court risk for the thrill it brings. It stands to reason that patience might temper this seeking, that time might dull the edge of their recklessness.\n\nShould we continue to hand the keys to the young, we shall see the grim harvest continue, the toll rising to heights yet unimagined. Come 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood these roads, a legion of new drivers eager to test their mettle.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this is a simple enough matter. Schools might still lay the groundwork with their teachings, yet none under eighteen should know the power that lies beneath their feet. A provisional permit might yet precede the granting of full license, demanding a measure of training that echoes the standards of states such as California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nFor the numbers that haunt us come from every corner of the land, and a single, unified decree could stand as a bulwark against this tide. What I propose is no new thing, but it is a thing that must be done.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies a disorder called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a shadowy realm where the brain struggles to sift through the sounds that life throws its way. This disorder, as defined by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, concerns itself with the central nervous system's ability to process auditory information, a process that is both delicate and mysterious. For those who wander this path, the hearing is not the issue. They hear as others do, yet the mind falters, unable to untangle the threads of sound from the tapestry of existence.\n\nThe whispers of CAPD trace back to the mid-twentieth century, to a time when it was but a fledgling thought, a disorder known then as auditory imperception. It was the Italians, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who began to unravel its secrets, crafting tests in the year of 1954. By 1961, Kimura had stepped into the fray, introducing methods to probe the dichotic nature of perception, revealing the complex physiology beneath. A gathering of minds in 1977 stirred the air with new questions, new paths to tread.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. Those it touches may find themselves adrift in space, unable to pinpoint a sound's origin or distinguish one sound from a chorus of noise. Patterns slip through their fingers, the subtle shifts in speech lost to them like whispers in the wind. Sounds can clash, one blotting out the next, leaving them without the clarity they seek. The sequence of sound eludes them, a puzzle unsolved, a story untold.\n\nTo diagnose this elusive disorder, one must embark on a journey of observation and testing. Audiologists and psychologists, with their tools and measures, seek to peel back the layers of auditory behavior, to understand how the patient responds to the world of sound. Yet, the road remains uncertain. No single test shines a light on CAPD's depths, and its origins are shrouded in mystery. Tests, both simple and complex, ask the patient to separate the cacophony, to find meaning in a series of spoken words or numbers. More intricate examinations delve into the ear's acoustics, measuring the echoes of sound within.\n\nAnd so, the understanding of CAPD continues, a flickering light in the vast darkness of the human mind.",
            "In the pursuit of a life in social work, I find myself drawn toward the path that leads to the Division of Family and Children Services. A path that promises the chance to stand sentinel for those children cast into the shadows of abuse and neglect. A place where troubled families seek refuge and understanding. It is here I aim to lay down the values I hold dear: service to others, respect for every soul, an ethical compass unwavering, a commitment to mend the fractured bonds between people, and an ongoing quest to refine my own professional competence. These are not mere tenets of social work; they are the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nThe urge to help others has been a constant whisper in my heart, even as the path forward lay obscured by uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the long halls of college, I witnessed souls grappling with their own ghosts, some fleeing in denial, others resorting to means that offered no peace. It was these encounters that nudged me toward a Bachelor's in Psychology. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in the year 2009, the road ahead remained a mystery. That summer, a friend led me to a trembling boy of sixteen, perched on her couch, seeking refuge from the storm that was his parents. The next day, he called upon the law to intervene. I followed the call to his home, a silent observer with a newly minted degree in Psychology. The officers, bound by the limits of the law, turned to me. I spoke with the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses painting their son's actions as mere manipulation. This encounter, fraught with the tension of 'simple' disputes, set me on the course toward social work, a calling to aid those ensnared in familial strife.\n\nSocial justice stands as another pillar in the field of social work. In our society, we exalt the individual and lament those who slip through our grasp. Yet, this notion of the individual often bows to antiquated traditions rather than true singularity. If society mourns the lost, why then do we strive for sameness? I walk this earth as my own being, unshackled by the chains of conformity. In my time at high school and college, I opposed injustice with every fiber of my being: my hair a canvas of unnatural hues, my attire a reflection of self, my ears adorned beyond convention, my voice loud in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), my stand firm against racism and discrimination wherever they dared to show their face. I believe in the fight for social justice and vow to continue my protest against its absence.\n\nAnd so, with each step forward, I carry these truths with me, a testament to the path I aspire to walk, a life dedicated to the service of others, to justice, and to the betterment of the world around me.",
            "The paper you hold is a discourse on the models that bind insomnia to the biological and the sociocultural realms. In the biological sphere, the threads of genetics and the medical weave hold their sway. The sociocultural, in its turn, casts its eye upon the bonds of environment, peering into the depths of race, of ethnicity, of the very fabric of society itself. This review, it dares to uncover, to lay bare the models, to dissect the very heart of the research that lends them voice. In the findings, strengths are revealed, weaknesses too, each one unmasked in the cold light of critique.\n\nA disorder of sleep, it is said, can be known by its kin: a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or yet another tied to the body or the bane of substances. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias claim their place in this pantheon. Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, those that warp the breath in sleep, the rhythms of the circadian, and those that stand unnamed. Insomnia, it holds sleep at bay, while Hypersomnia battles to keep the eye unshuttered, both for the span of a month. Narcolepsy, the thief of wakefulness, brings cataplexy and the dream that comes unbidden. The Parasomnias, they walk in the night, bringing nightmares, terrors, movements of sleepwalking, and more that elude the tongue’s grasp. The disorders they link to the mind's troubles, Axis I and Axis II, they too are part of this tale. And so this review draws its focus on insomnia, and the primary disorders of sleep, through the lens of biology and socioculture.\n\nThe biological model, it speaks of genes, of inheritance, of the body's own tale in the disorder of sleep. The neurons, the orexin they bear, lie in the hypothalamus, guardians of the cycle of sleep and waking. The study, it took mice as its muse, and found phenotypic GABAB receptors on those neurons of orexin, bearers of the sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when roused, it calls forth sleep. If its fire is quenched, anxiety flees, and sleep is welcomed. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, it lengthened the sleep of the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, a tale is spun that the mice may yet tell of human sleep. Here is seen the intertwining of genes and the world without, in the GABAB receptor of the human kind. A flaw in this receptor’s tale, and sleep may be lost without the aid of medicine. The sociocultural thread, it whispers of inheritance, of phenotypes guiding sleep, and the twisted tale of a receptor marred. It speaks of the shadows cast upon life, upon learning, upon labor, upon the endless tasks of the day when focus is adrift.",
            "He'd been a student there at University Park for what seemed like the turn of two and a half years, or perhaps four and a half semesters if one reckoned by the calendar of the school. For many who roamed those grounds, himself among them, the very act of moving from place to place was a burden. In that first year they'd placed him in an East Halls dormitory, a place far flung as if it sought to escape the bounds of the campus altogether, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center beyond. The journey from his abode in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning at Willard, which lay nearer the heart of the grounds, could consume a good twenty-five minutes by foot. And that on a day when the skies did not conspire against him, as they so often did in State College. An older alum, not many seasons ahead of him, had spoken of a time when those dorms were cut off by vast stretches of barren land. Now that space had been claimed, filled with fields of sport, towering edifices like the new Creamery, and buildings for health, and all circled by apartments like sentinels. As the campus swelled, the struggle to navigate it grew ever more profound. What remedy for this ailment of movement? A simple thing it seemed, the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone was no panacea. It required the will of students to ride and a campus shaped to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend who had taken up bicycling once more after some years' neglect. The friend mused aloud, baffled by his own abandonment of such a noble steed. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said. \"For a while, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the sole way to traverse this place.\" For the body it was a boon, and for travel, unmatched in its efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some sweat of the brow and a man could cover thirty miles or more. Like many drawn from the dormitories, he now dwelled off campus, no nearer the center than some halls of residence. This year, he'd made the wise choice to purchase a bicycle. Each day brought him to Thomas building, an easy twenty-five-minute walk if he let his legs decide the pace. Yet with the bicycle, he could cut that journey to five if he pushed the pedals hard. But there was Pollock Road, the most direct path, and not always an easy passage, be it on a bike or on foot. Walking had its own merits, true, but time was a luxury he could not afford. Without that bicycle, he'd be bound to walk, and that daily trek would steal another thirty to forty minutes from his hours. Over a week, he'd be losing more than two and a half hours. And more yet if he counted the other journeys to classes and appointments and such. Time he could ill spare in the days allotted to him.",
            "In the somber landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the specter of technology looms large, its great shadow cast by the capitalist machinations that bind it. Here lies a world where the community smothers the individual, and the pursuit of fleeting happiness is a creed whispered into the ear from birth. A populace molded into pawns, their lives governed by the unseen hand of the World Controller, their thoughts tethered to a single dogma. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one might discern Huxley’s deep-seated wariness of these burgeoning constructs. Terms born of Marxism—homogeny, reification—dance through the narrative, underscoring Huxley’s critique of the economic tides of his era.\n\nThe satire of capitalism unfurls in the guise of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that cloaks the masses from understanding their true standing among the economic strata. They are ensnared by the lure of personal gain, their sight blinded by the ideological chains that bind the proletariat and laborers, mirrored in the conditioning suffered by the denizens of Huxley’s world. The Deltas, the Gammas, each class stripped of will, their minds reshaped by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to revel in excess as ordained by the World Controller. The grip of hegemony encircles them, a specter of domination wherein the lower classes remain oblivious to their own subjugation, buying into an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism. The Alphas and Betas, birthed with the awareness of their bondage, remain inert, save for the few like Bernard who dare to question. The dance of social classes, a tapestry of oppression under the capitalist yoke, unfolds with stark clarity.\n\nIn this world, the ties that bind disparate souls unravel, the novel refusing to grant its characters the nuance of depth. Huxley’s hand perhaps suggesting that the ascent of technology and capitalism strips man of his soul and voice. Love is a phantom, and emotion a shadow—interactions rendered shallow, as men speak of women in terms of their pneumatic allure, and women recount their liaisons with unabashed candor. The complacency of each class in their societal rung echoes the economic tendrils of capitalism. Their unyielding allegiance to their role within the hive mind mirrors Marxist insights into the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy so long as they consume, adhere, and march in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC. A class filled with voices rising and falling over a single question that seemed to stretch beyond the walls of the room: Is Islam a hostile religion? Such a question now, in these days, seems more pressing than ever. From the shadows of 9/11, I have watched the media's gaze shift. Once, it looked upon Islam with fear, with suspicion, but now it seems to have swung to a strange patience, a tolerance not easily understood. Hard to imagine in those days of 2001 that a man like Barack Obama, bearing a name tethered to a Muslim lineage, could stride into the arena of presidential ambition.\n\nThe Prophet's life, in its telling, intrigued me. A biography that seemed to run against the grain of what I had come to know of Muhammad. I had thought him a man who bent others to his will, who took tribes and made them kneel to the creed of Islam. Yet, in those pages, he was cast anew, a martyr misunderstood, humbling himself before others, the truth of his teachings drawing the people to him one by one.\n\nThere are lines drawn between the stories of Jesus and the so-called miracles of Muhammad that are difficult to ignore. In the tale where he multiplied mutton and milk until forty men had eaten their fill, I see an attempt to paint him as a prophet who walked in truth and miracles, needing nothing more to prove his worth. It feels a theft, a shadow cast over the light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to weave the life of one into the fabric of another's legend.\n\nThe biography is threaded with tales that speak of conversions, of witnesses coming to the truth of their own accord. Yet these stories seem spun from hearsay, tales told by those who heard from another and another still. It is a thing that sits uneasily with me, for while it seeks to stand as proof, it leaves a shadow of doubt, a whisper of suspicion.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the way they lift Muhammad, setting him upon a pedestal as a man of divine grace, humble and wise. Yet history casts another light, one that tells of a rise to power that speaks little of gentleness. I wonder if those who follow him today know this history that lies beneath the surface of his story.",
            "In the twilight of beliefs where the gospels were first whispered, the teachings of Jesus lay like stones in a streambed, unmoved and unheeded as the waters of Christian thought rushed past in their ceaseless journey. With the passage of time, the river of faith meandered, leaving behind the roots that anchored its beginning. Through the ages, you can see the world of Christianity diverging from its primal path, like travelers who have lost their way. Yet now, in the looming present, there is a rumbling beneath the earth, a stirring of the spirit that speaks of return. The old ways hold firm like ancient oaks in a restless forest, but the winds of change are strong, and they whisper of a coming day when history shall turn upon itself. \n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will find themselves drawn to the echoes of their faith's origins, yearning to strip away the layers of doctrine that have gathered like dust upon an ancient artifact. This slow revelation will be as inexorable as the tide, a movement that pares back the centuries until only the essence of Jesus’ message remains, unmarred by the hands of time. Across the lands of America and Europe, the faithful will rise like shadows at dawn, seeking a purer communion. The church will stand as a bastion, guiding the faithful back along the path to where it all began. With every step retraced, the myriad voices of Christendom will meld into a single chorus, the discord of division fading into a harmony of belief.\n\nHistory is a wheel that turns upon itself. Once, Christians were hunted and scorned by Rome, yet Rome became the heart of their faith. The land of freedom bore the scars of bondage, only to see those once shackled rise to lead it. In the days to come, this great wheel will turn again, drawing the threads of Christian faith back to their source, unraveling the tapestry of differences woven through the ages. This unraveling will not be of violence but of understanding, as the words of Jesus are read not as stone-carved edicts but as the poetry of metaphor. \n\nLook back far enough, and you find the roots entwined deep in Judaism, that ancient soil from which the sapling of Christianity grew. The Romans came, and the Jewish people split like a tree into branches, each reaching toward the sky in its own way—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the quiet multitude. These divisions were the seeds of what would become, yet from them all grew the solitary figure of Jesus, whose message would one day call the faithful back to the beginning, where the river first began its course.",
            "In the shadowed labyrinth of Packingtown, where the sky itself seemed to be a canvas for the soot and ash of ambition, there lay the stark truth of mankind's naked avarice. The Jungle, Sinclair's bitter ode to the industrial age, unveils the primal greed that festers within the human soul. A world where men look only to their own gain, their eyes cold to the plight of those trampled beneath their relentless ascent. Here the factory owners, lords of smoke and metal, wrought their empire with a callous disregard for the lives consumed in their furnace of progress. The great chimneys rose like obelisks, their plumes of smoke a testament to the sacrifice of the earth and its creatures, a sacrifice unheeded by those who reaped its spoils.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the great machine, were held in thrall to a merciless whim. For a dollar, they were bound, their worth measured in coin and not in flesh. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair writes, a world where loyalty is a forgotten relic and decency a ghost. They toiled under a sunless sky, the hours long, the reward scant, and at the end of the day, the axe could fall without warning, casting them adrift into the night. In this grim epoch, the law was a specter, the worker's guardian absent, and the factories a wilderness where only the strong or the cunning survived.\n\nYet, beyond the din and clamor, there was a deeper silence, a silence of souls worn thin by the grindstone of survival. The unions, a false beacon, often preyed upon the very men they claimed to shield, their coffers filled from the pockets of the poor. The men of Packingtown were bound by chains unseen, their lives a cycle of endless toil, their cries swallowed by the great maw of industry. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign,\" Sinclair laments, \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" In this wasteland, morality withered, and the human spirit lay shackled, as inevitable and pervasive as the very smoke that blotted out the sun.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature's past, where the echoes of great minds linger, Edgar Allan Poe whispered of a land beyond the veil of dreams. \"Dream-Land,\" he called it, a poem he held close to his heart. In its verses, the name \"Thulé\" surfaces, a name that Virgil once uttered, conjuring visions of an island far north of Britain, a place where the world as known faded into the unknown. Virgil's mention was sure, yet Poe's fascination with the works of German minds was a thread that wove through his own creations.\n\nThere, in the shadows of his words, lay a connection to Goethe, a titan of German letters. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings upon Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" saw the mirrored lines and drew a line from one to the other, whispering of imitation. Goethe, whose name graced the pages of the Oxford Companion to English Literature, stood as a colossus, his \"Faust\" a gem of poetic drama, unfolding in two acts—the first in 1808, the second marking the twilight of his life in 1832. Within this epic tale, nestled like a secret, was a poem of a king named Thule.\n\nA king who clutched a goblet, a gift from his departed queen, and in his grief, drank deep from its depths. In his sorrow, he cast the goblet into the sea and, with eyes closed to the world, followed it into the eternal night. The king's tale, a mirror darkly held to Poe's own struggles and losses, perhaps echoed in the land of dreams Poe traversed. Faust's tale found a new voice in H. P. Grattan's romantic drama in 1842, a whisper away from Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where \"ultima Thule\" found its place.\n\nIn Poe's collected words, Thule emerged twice, a haunting refrain. In \"Dream-Land,\" it framed the poem, a land of shadows where dead friends walked and colors fled. It mirrored Goethe's king, bereft of his queen, lost in a world without light or life. The two, Poe's vision and Goethe's lament, walked side by side, a dialogue across the pages of time.\n\nGoethe, a figure Poe would have known, if only for the echoes of Tennyson's admiration. When Poe spoke of Tennyson, the respect for Goethe was an unspoken bond. The world of letters knew Goethe's works, their reproductions spreading like wildfire, and Poe, ever the seeker, would have found them in the dim light of his study, the ink still fresh upon the page.",
            "In the dim corridors of law and consequence, the question arises. In the state of California, where the sun bakes the land and the law intertwines justice with the unpredictable hand of fate, can a soul wounded in body and spirit from a fall on an errant spill of applesauce in a grocery's aisle seek retribution beyond mere compensation? Can they claim the punitive with whispers of malice against the one who turned a blind eye twice to the hazard that lay there unheeded, left alone for the half-hour it takes to finish a meal?\n\nThe judge, a figure carved of patience and deliberation, would be hesitant to sweep aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To cast her claim in the iron of justice, she must lay bare the evidence that the overseer's deeds were done not in ignorance but in willful defiance of the harm that lay just beneath the surface, like a serpent in the grass. She must paint his actions in hues of darkness, despicable in their neglect. Palmer can stand before them and weave her tale, that the keeper of the store should have known the peril of leaving a spill untended, for in the months before, others had fallen victim to the same fate, their stories not unlike hers. Yet he turned away, his back to their plight. Her tale of his despicable disregard, though less forceful, finds its strength in the history of six others who had fallen before her, in that same year of trials, and still he chose inaction.\n\nThe clock marks the day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five in the evening. Rich Wayne, a humble worker of D&D Markets, bore witness to the spill and sought his superior, Paul Martin, who was then at table, breaking bread. Martin, wrapped in the cloak of indifference, dismissed the concern with words that echoed his disregard, speaking of his meal and the lack of time for the troubles of patrons. A quarter of an hour passed, and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan, spoke the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his negligence, echoed his prior dismissal. As the half-hour turned its course, Palmer found herself lost in the applesauce, her back caught in the gravity of neglect. Five others before her had met similar fates in that year at D&D's door. Now she seeks justice, both to mend her body and to punish the careless hand.\n\nIn the realm of California's statutes, one may claim punitive damages when a breach arises not from the bonds of contract but from a more sinister place, where oppression, fraud, or malice dwell. The law, etched in the annals of time, speaks of malice as a deed done with intent to harm. Absent such intent, it must be a deed despicable, wrought with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts, bastions of reason, have named actions malicious when done with a knowing shrug at the danger they pose, when the actor saw the storm coming and chose to stand in its path. Such is the measure of malice in the eyes of the law.",
            "She'd always been searching for something in the quiet hours of her life. A yearning that lingered like a shadow since she was fourteen, just stepping into the turbulent world of adolescence. Three years had passed and still the ache remained, a constant whisper in the back of her mind. She reckoned it was not a thing she sought but a person, yet no boy caught her interest. They courted her in their clumsy, adolescent way, but she found no appeal in their fumbling attempts. She puzzled over this strange absence of desire, pondering what made her different from the other girls. The years had spun out possibilities, none of which satisfied her quiet inquiries. So she moved through life, a question unanswered.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents, quiet souls who rarely raised their voices in anger, found little to dispute with their daughter. Their only tiffs arose from her declarations of independence, her insistence on her own path. Hers was a spirit lively and bright, a counterpoint to their calm demeanor, endearing her to those who crossed her path. \n\nBut today the peace was shattered. As she moved through the house, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry pierced the air. Her mother's voice, once melodic, now sharp with pain. Fear gripped her as she raced to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain drawing short breaths from her lips. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came squeezed and hurried, the anguish clear. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and the daughter, grateful for her strength, hoisted her up. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic smells and quiet dread. But her mind was fixed on her mother, blocking out the rest. She bore her inside, calling out for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched in their lines. A bed appeared and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for immediate care, while the daughter was left to worry alone.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf, and now the daughter sat with her thoughts, waiting in the sterile quiet.",
            "In the long corridors of human inquiry, one study set its gaze upon the Mediterranean Diet, a regimen born of sunlit groves and blue waters, where olive groves whisper secrets to the sea. The scholars sought to find if this diet, in its alternate form, with its score that marked adherence, could indeed ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and the silent approach of stroke. This aMed diet, as they named it, diverged from the traditional path, placing greater faith in the bounty of plants, the quiet strength of plant proteins, the soft whisper of monounsaturated fats over the harsh tones of their saturated kin, and the gifts of the ocean. It held back from the excesses of flesh and fat and allowed for the gentle tide of alcohol in moderation.\n\nThe annals of past studies spoke of the Med diet’s power to stave off the finality of cardiovascular demise, and an intervention proclaimed its superiority over the low-fat path, in guiding the weight-laden to lighter shores and taming the unruly tides of cholesterol. Yet, the shadow of stroke had not been their focus.\n\nThe study wound its way through the lives of 74,886 women, aged and unscarred by the diseases they sought to avoid, nurses all, who dwelled across eleven states of this vast land. Six times, from the year 1984 to 2004, they turned in their accounts of what they consumed, each morsel and sip etched into the record. The diligence of these women was near unwavering, with more than ninety-five percent remaining faithful to the study’s call across two decades. The truth of their reports was tested against the hard facts of medical records and the finality of death certificates, carving out a path of certainty in a world of probabilities.\n\nThey watched these women, calculated their body’s measure, their habits of smoke and aspirin, of vitamins and hormones, and from 1986, their leisure pursuits. They sought to smooth the rough edges of random chance, averaging the diet scores to better reflect the truth of years lived. They adjusted their sights for confounding factors, those tricksters that might lead them astray.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard models, they peered at the ties between diet and disease, separating the fatal from the nonfatal in their quest for clarity. They found that those who embraced the Mediterranean way, with scores that reached the heights of the aMed scale, faced a lesser risk of heart and mind’s betrayal. Across the span of twenty years, the numbers gathered: 2391 incidents of heart's affliction, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths of cardiovascular ilk. Those at the pinnacle of the aMed scale bore a risk far diminished, a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those at the scale’s nadir.\n\nThus, in the twilight of the study, the words were spoken: the Mediterranean way, in its alternate guise, stands as a sentinel against the ravages of heart and stroke.",
            "Hitler alive in Burma, the sign declares. \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a street corner, her cardboard placard raised aloft, a stark message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, a land by another name called Myanmar, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta, its power seized in the coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to protests unseen for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes led these uprisings, a revolution named for the hue of peace they wore. The populace soon followed, and though the junta permitted the monks their assembly at first, violence soon reared its head. Monasteries fell to the military's wrath. Foreign journalists were seized, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, met his end on the streets, a casualty of presence. Official accounts claim thirteen souls lost, yet Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army days before, spoke of a toll in thousands, bodies uncounted, unspoken.\n\nSuch tales are old as time. A government's iron grip, its need to silence dissent, is a shadow etched across history’s pages. Emperors of Rome named themselves chosen by deities to rule unchallenged. In Japan, emperors claimed divine descent, destined to lead through the making of cell phones and ritual death. The president of our time, George W. Bush, finds counsel in weekly calls with Ted Haggard, a leader of fools under the Republic Party's banner.\n\nThe world knows these tales. Tiananmen Square in the June of 1989, where scholars and workers and the young stood against their rulers, and the numbers of the dead lost in the fog of conflicting tales. Rwanda in the 1990s, where Hutu militias with the government's aid wrought genocide upon the Tutsis and moderates alike. And Hitler’s Third Reich, spreading darkness across continents, where Jewish lives were taken in the thousands, an atrocity among the ages.\n\nSuch shadows, ever lingering.",
            "In the dim glow of a smoky room where the notes of jazz hung heavy like the wreaths of smoke that curled and twisted about, there sat Duke Ellington at the piano. His fingers, delicate and sure, touched the keys with a subtlety that seemed almost an afterthought amidst the elaborate tapestry of sound he wove with his orchestra. An orchestra shaped by time, by the honing of talent and the forging of a singular vision that was Ellington's. In the compositions laid before him, his presence was a whisper, a shadow. Yet it was as a composer he truly sang, crafting pieces of such richness and complexity that they stood as monuments to the prowess of each band member. He was the architect of a musical landscape where soloists could roam, improvisations unbound, against a backdrop of meticulously orchestrated passages.\n\nEllington understood the voices of his musicians, each a unique brushstroke on his canvas, and it was this mastery that allowed him to conjure sounds both coherent and original. His compositions were a testament to this understanding, marked by innovation and brilliance that would ripple through the annals of jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s sound, of Creole Love Call where the voice was not mere words but an instrument, a texture, a color. It was in this piece his genius shone, as he complemented the soloists' style, a thread through the fabric of his career.\n\nThe slow, deliberate unfolding of Creole Love Call in twelve bar blues, six choruses, each a story unto itself. The voice and reeds in call and response, the trumpet muted and blue, the clarinet soaring with syncopated piano whispers, the full band echoing, the climactic swirl of reeds and brass, the voice growling, the trombone’s dissonant farewell. Here was Ellington, weaving voice into the very soul of the music.\n\nA year passed and in Hot and Bothered, Ellington’s ear for tone color found its match in tight orchestration, in the dance between “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat, a conversation in sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) bore witness to these ideas stretched further, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s trombone muted and melodic, the melody a thread that tied it all together. These were the sounds of Ellington, a legacy in jazz’s long, winding road.",
            "In the silent hours when questions of change whisper in the dark, we find ourselves asking just why creatures shift and mold as they do. What unseen hand guides their becoming? A century has passed since D’Arcy Thompson mused on the mathematic's reach, and yet the mystery holds. Today, new equations seek to unravel the shell's secret. In the realm of Prunum's form, we delve, threading numbers through its ancient spirals, hoping to seize the ghost of change itself. \n\nWith X-rayed eyes, we search the bones of Prunum, seeking the shape's truth. Quantities become keys, unlocking doors to shells that might be or have been, their forms cast in the digital ether of CerioShell. Alongside the hands-on craft of experiment, these spectral shells speak of the great dance of evolution in their stony silence.\n\nConsider the shell: a spiraling journey through time, born from the deep axis of its own becoming. Whorls grow like whispered secrets, each turn a chapter in the tale, bound by the suture’s line. The last whorl, body and breadth, tells of the end's beginning. The spire lifts its apex to the heavens, while below, the base anchors its tale. Through the aperture, life reaches out, touching the world beyond its carapace.\n\nThe shell in its manifold faces—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a new world. To count the whorls is to trace the shell's life from the start, marking the suture's first breath. From that line, quarter by quarter, the tale unfolds.\n\nSee the shell not just as structure but as story. A path traced through the ether, the aperture’s journey marked by the passage of days, the growth of an unseen hand. Plotted in space and time, the shell’s tale can be told in numbers. And with those numbers, a new tale begins to form, a mollusk's life rewritten through the lens of math and mind.",
            "The numbers tell a tale of stasis. In Indonesia, the breath of the newborn and the pulse of the infant linger in a place unyielding, unbroken by the sun or the passing of shadows, for the span of a decade. The nation strides toward certain goals, the water and the sanitation, they say, but the mothers and the children, they wait, their dreams unmet, the year of 2015 a forlorn beacon. The reasons are many, tangled like roots beneath the earth, and speak to a need for strength in the system, not the fleeting balm of isolated interventions.\n\nIn the realm of birth, there is progress, if it can be called such. A skilled hand at 72 percent of births, though the term skilled is stretched thin, including those who know not the ways of medicine should the fates turn against the mother. Hemorrhage claims them still, the blood a testament to the gap between what is and what should be. The numbers deceive, for the truth remains, a truth that demands more than has been given. The children, too, suffer, with fewer seen by a healer's eye when struck by the scourge of diarrheal disease. The care after birth is a haze, incomplete, a concern that stretches across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife that saves, the cesarean, is wielded too rarely, at 4 percent where it should be more. In the city, it is seen more often, but in the fields and the hills, only 2 percent know its edge. A country divided, access a privilege of the city, the wealth, a chasm between those who have and those who have not. The poor walk a harder road to the healer's door, their pockets lighter, the cost a barrier that looms large.\n\nThe path forward is a question, a question of how best to mend what is broken. Is it a matter of programs, each a spear aimed at a single target, or should the foundation be strengthened, the whole given the attention it needs? The allure of the program is strong, its goals clear, its results quick as a hawk's strike. But the dangers are there, too, the risks that one focus draws away the lifeblood from others, as has been seen with the call of HIV/AIDS drawing away from family planning. The programs run parallel like streams uncoordinated, leading to a flood of forms and papers that drown what they seek to aid.\n\nThese are the choices, the paths before us in the dim light of the present.",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has unfurled like a tapestry of myriad hues and textures, each thread a genre unto itself, so tangled and vast that one might lose themselves in the mere naming of them. And yet, within this labyrinth, the seed of a singular creation has given rise to a multitude of branches, each one a sub-genre reaching out into the dark unknown. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal stands like a colossus, its form and nature shifting across the years, becoming both a mirror and a shadow of the human soul. It is a genre that speaks in tongues of fury and despair, a cacophony of emotions drawn from the night’s darker palette.\n\nHeavy Metal is a chameleon. Born of a time when the world sought to break from the shackles of convention, it grew in breadth and depth, its roots spreading wide as artists discovered its boundless potential. It became a tree of many branches, each branch a sub-genre, and then those branches bore smaller branches, sub-sub-genres, until the tree was vast and its identity elusive. In this tangled forest of sound, what once was called Heavy Metal is now a question with many answers, a chimera of borrowed themes and borrowed voices.\n\nTo understand this beast, one must trace its lineage and delve into the heart of the movement. Metal is more than a genre; it is a force, a movement that sweeps through the world, defined by its darkness. It is a music of excess, where the bass rumbles like distant thunder, where the volume is a tempest, where violence and theatrics are woven into its very fabric. It is a place where musicians wield their instruments with the precision of a surgeon and the fury of a storm. Metal is born of a time when the air was thick with the haze of psychedelic dreams, a time when madness was a muse and otherworldly visions were set to sound. It is a music that speaks of the abyss, a visceral language new to the ears of those accustomed to the light.\n\nFrom this dark wellspring emerged songs like \"Helter Skelter,\" a harbinger of the metal to come, a dark echo from the Beatles not unlike the shadows thrown by the Rolling Stones. A challenge, a proclamation that they too could summon the weight of the world’s shadows into song. Thus did they etch their mark upon The White Album, a testament made in sound and fury.",
            "Long before the Surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions, both in paint and in the quiet longing of his heart. The Dream, a work from 1910, stands as testament to more than the woman who gazes in wonder at a strange land conjured from sleep. It bears the weight of Rousseau's own yearnings, the painter's dream of recognition, of acceptance in the circles of artists and patrons alike. He wrestled with a dilemma as old as art itself: to follow the well-trodden paths of style for the validation of the art world, or to strike out into the wilderness of his own imagination. The Dream captures this struggle, a reflection of his life's pursuit.\n\nTo see this painting for what it is, one must know the man behind it. Henri Rousseau was born on a spring day in 1844, in Laval, a place nestled in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, found some measure of prosperity, though no such fortune awaited Rousseau in art's world. His journey began without the guiding hand of formal education, and for decades he served as a gabelou, a toll collector, though the name douanier, customs inspector, clung to him mistakenly. Grief visited his life early, with the passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him only his daughter, Julia. In painting, he sought solace, a new beginning amidst a sea of loss. Unlike the painters who cast the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of his own world, with dreams and hopes that mirrored those of his peers.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance is a thread that runs through his life. Unversed in the formalities of art, he came to it late, his work emerging in the shadow of more celebrated contemporaries. Recognition did not come easily or soon. It was only as Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's light flickered brighter. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of their contrast: where Matisse feared the banal, Rousseau sought the familiar, craving the approval of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn the end, The Dream is more than a painting; it is the tale of a man's soul laid bare, its colors and forms whispering of the path he chose, the dreams he dared to follow.",
            "In the quiet creeds of thinkers past and present, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. As if in the marrow of things a reason abides, waiting for the light. Keats whispered it in the lines of an urn, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" like a gospel for the earthbound, all they need to know and all they ever will. The knowing we carry is burdened by lessons learned and experiences lived, yet in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, there is a knowing that comes unbidden, unschooled. They speak not in commands but in whispers, tracing the outlines of a world where beauty and morality are not dictated but discerned. Our minds strive to explain the grace of a painting, the righteousness of an act, but fall short of prescribing what makes them so.\n\nIn the telling of art or morals, that essence slips through the fingers. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, where scholars speak of light and shadow, of time and place, yet these words cannot grasp the heart of her. Ask a man his favorite work and you will hear the telling pause, the something about it that defies the tongue. Art and morals, like stories, live beyond their telling, as O'Connor spoke, for a story holds what a statement leaves wanting. Describe a tale, and you miss what lies beyond, something that cannot be captured in the net of words. Ethics, too, eludes the grasp of speech, as Wittgenstein knew, for it is transcendental, living in the spaces between words. This something, this ineffable quality, it is the power that art and morality wield, the bridge between what is seen and what is felt.\n\nMorality and art, bound as they are, reach us at a depth beyond reason, a noumenal realm Kant named. They touch us in ways clear and yet unexplainable. In literature, the bond deepens, for in its pages dwell the moral fibers that weave through life itself. Like McKean said, literature stands apart, its moral core unyielding, as essential as breath to life. For life is values entwined, and literature calls to us with those values laid bare. It is in the telling of tales that we find ourselves, and in the finding, understand what cannot be spoken.",
            "In the gray dawn of Europe's heart, Germany stands unyielding, a land forged in the crucible of time, its culture a river flowing from the shadowed Alps of München to the distant shores of Kiel, where the Baltic whispers secrets of old world seas. This same current runs through Köln by the Rhine's timeless embrace, through the very core of Germany, until it reaches Dresden's Saxon soul on the banks of the Elbe. A culture so singular, borne from the loam of forgotten tribes and fractured realms.\n\nGermania, the ancient marrow of this nation, holds its name shrouded in the mists of scholarly quarrel. Tacitus, in his chronicles, spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore this name, their banners flying before the Gauls in battle's din. Caesar, that conqueror of old, first set the word “Germanus” into the annals of his Gallic conquests, borrowing from the Gauls to mark those fierce beyond the Rhine, warring ceaselessly with the tribes he had yet to subdue. The origin, a ghostly thing, whispers of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, while others claim it springs from the spear, the ger, or the shouts of battle, a garim, echoing through time.\n\nTacitus himself penned the tale of these people in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" casting them as unchanged, untouched by the mingling of races, fierce and true in their homeland of storm-ridden skies and unyielding earth. \"Who,\" he wondered, \"would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for this harsh clime, unless it were their blood's call?\"\n\nAnd so it was, not the Romans who sought Germania's embrace, but their reach extending, seeking the wealth of its soil, sending their legions to test the bounds of empire. But always they returned to their Rome, vast and sprawling, while the tribes of Germania grew, living at the empire's edge, trading their earth's bounty, their warriors marching under Roman standards, their eyes always cast back to the dark forests and the land that bore them.

            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise unfurls a tale of deception that, while beguiling in its utility, demands eventual renunciation lest one loses themselves in the masquerade. Yet, the shedding of such guises brings with it the chill of isolation, a casting out into the wilds of one's own making. Thus, the choice looms: self-preservation or the fragile tendrils of connection that bind us to the world. For some, the revelation of deceit is met with mere bemusement, but others find their pride wounded, the farce a bitter draught they are loath to swallow.\n\nThe entanglement of disguise with the reversal of gender roles weaves a web tangled with questions of identity. Why does one cloak themselves in the garb of another gender? Viola stands as a testament to survival, her donning of masculine attire a shield against the unknown perils of foreign shores: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse holds, yet it casts her adrift from the women who might offer solace, severing her from the sisterhood she might have claimed. Olivia, deceived by appearances, mistakens her for Sebastian and entwines herself in love’s folly: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, Viola grapples with the unspoken pull towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo those who tread the modern path, Twelfth Night offers a lens through which deception lays bare the hidden chambers of the heart. Olivia and Orsino, drawn into Viola’s orbit, must confront desires whispered yet unvoiced. Is Olivia’s affection for Cesario born of the guise of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth? Perhaps it is not so, for Olivia, in Shakespeare’s hands, might simply mirror those who judge by sight alone. Her swift turn of heart from Cesario to Sebastian, and the familial embrace of Viola, signal the transience of her affections: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the annals of time where men carved out empires upon the backs of others, the German dominion over foreign lands stands noted for its harshness, a brutality that bore witness in the blood and dust of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples beneath the unyielding sun of German South West Africa. Yet to account for an empire's breadth by a singular stroke is to ignore the variegated tapestry of its existence. The German colonial empire stretched across vast lands, each corner as unique in governance as the very soil it claimed. Within its borders, the efforts to educate were as diverse as the lands themselves. When the British took the reigns of German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year nineteen hundred and nineteen, they found a people not wanting for knowledge, their minds sharpened by the tutelage of those who came before. Praises were penned for German endeavors in Kamerun and other far-flung reaches where scholars wrote of the day's light cast upon eager minds. Yet South West Africa, the land now called Namibia, stood in stark relief against such tales. There, unlike the far fields of East Africa where schools rose at the hand of the state, the task of imparting knowledge fell to those of the cloth, missionary societies left to their own devices with nary a nod from the powers that be. Yet for the European children, there was no such lack. Resources flowed like a river to their schools, state-backed, well-ordered, and watched over with a keen eye. The echoes of these choices lingered long past the German's departure. Where other lands could boast of learned men, South West Africa remained a land where many had not touched the written word. The reasons for this divergence lie in a tangled web of social, political, and economic threads. This study seeks to unravel those threads, to gaze upon the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled from afar. The pages of history are filled with words on German colonial education, penned mostly in German in the early days when the empire still held its sway. These works sought to capture the essence of learning in those distant lands. Later, the English tongue took up the tale, comparing the ways of Germany's scattered territories and delving deep into their secrets. It was Cohen who spoke most clearly on the matter, casting his eye upon the schools of South West Africa and East Africa, laying bare the forces that shaped them. He spoke of the settlers, the many who called South West Africa home, and how their presence shaped that land's pursuit of knowledge. In the reckoning of Germany's holdings, South West Africa stood apart. Its climate, though kinder than some, bore the harshness of the desert. Yet by the year nineteen hundred and thirteen, fifteen thousand souls of European descent had made it their home, a number unmatched save in the more temperate climes of East Africa.",
            "In the annals of time, there stood two nations, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a dance of rivalry that spanned the breadth of fifty-seven years. From the year of 1836 to the dawn of 1893, a time when the world turned slowly on its axis and men measured their days by the rising and falling of the sun. It was a rivalry marked by blood and fire, by the clash of cultures and the unyielding grip of tradition. The high-water mark of this enmity came with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, hungry for land and power, bore down upon Mexico with the fury of a storm, wresting from its grasp Texas and the American Southwest. In those days, the earth trembled under the weight of armies, and the sky was darkened by the smoke of battles fought and lost. Yet, even as the dust settled, other skirmishes flared, like echoes of a distant thunder, until at last the storm abated, just before the first great war of the world.\n\nIn their struggle, these two nations were not alone. For across the vast expanse of the world, many lands have known the bitter taste of rivalry with their neighbors. Nations that share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the waves against a rocky shore. The United States and Mexico were no different from countless other rivalries that have arisen between nations bound by geography. David M. Pletcher once observed that only in Mexico and Cuba did there exist long-lasting American diplomatic problems. These lands, so close and yet so far, have always been rivals to the United States, even as other nations in the Americas found a more peaceful accord.\n\nReligion, that old specter, cast a long shadow over their relations. It was a rift as ancient as time itself, for throughout history, nations have been torn asunder by religious discord. Sally Frahm spoke of how, if in the twentieth century Americans stood against fascism and communism, in the centuries before, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy. It was an ideological struggle, not unlike the cold war that later gripped the world, but here it was not politics that stood in opposition, but the very soul of belief. The distrust grew deep, a legacy of the enmity between the English and the Spanish, inherited like a dark heirloom from their colonial pasts, a barrier to the peace both nations sought.\n\nDiehl and Goerts chronicled the disputes, seventeen in all, marking the years of rivalry like notches on a weathered staff. Most were born of the land itself, of territorial disputes and border raids, of bandits and outlaws who haunted the edges of civilization. These raids, like wolves circling at the edge of the firelight, were a scourge that persisted until both nations, weary of the bloodshed, brought forth their armies to restore order.\n\nBut as time wore on, as the sun rose and set upon the land, the rivalry began to wane. Mexico, bound by the chains of circumstance, grew dependent upon the United States in ways substantial and profound. In the twilight of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted, from the lust for land to the desire for economic influence, and the fires of rivalry cooled, leaving only the embers of what once had been.",
            "Fifteen years past, I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me, an affliction that crept in like a thief, leaving me bereft of the life I once knew. I was a nurse then, drawn to its call by a deep and abiding need for the safety that eluded my younger years. They would say, as if reciting a sacred verse, \"You'll always find work; folks will always fall ill.\" And so, though my heart leaned toward the pursuit of science or the written word—both, if fate allowed—I took up nursing.\n\nYet there I was, forty-six, unaccompanied, with nary a coin to my name and no strength left to labor. To this day, I remain shackled by disability, the years of Social Security dwindling my possessions to naught. I endure, but each day is a siege upon my spirit, a test of my fortitude against the chaos that now defines my existence. Certainty has fled my life, save for one truth: I could not have weathered these years without the steadfastness of family and the rare friend. Disaster, real and relentless, strips away the veneer of strength.\n\nLife, I have learned, holds no promises. Emergencies will come, like storms over an endless plain—some small, others vast. Preparation is a shield, but some tempests are too fierce to face alone.\n\nI see the folly in placing hope in a government bloated and frail, yet my wish is for Americans to find trust anew in one another—to relearn the ancient art of giving aid and asking for it, rather than retreating to solitary refuges of fear. The tales of rugged individualism that echo through our history—those are not what sustained our ancestors. It was compassion, respect, and shared burdens that carried them through the Rockies to distant shores.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. A kit for disasters, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheets of plastic with duct tape for sealing windows against unseen threats. Flashlights, batteries, candles in abundance, matches that defy the rain, and cans of sustenance. If you can, find a plot of land, raise crops, preserve what the earth gives you. It is wisdom, as is a stove that burns wood—but not if you dwell in a tower of brick and mortar.\n\nAnd while you gather these things, seek out your neighbors. Learn their faces, their stories. For in that knowing lies the true shelter against the storms.",
            "In the long stretch of the past, a prince emerged in a time now called the fifth or sixth century before the common era. He would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey, a renunciation of the earthly world that led him into the quiet light of enlightenment. From his teachings, a path took form, Buddhism, and among its adherents, the most orthodox came to be known as Theravada. This faith, now weathered with the years, stands upon the foundation of two and a half millennia. Yet, it bears not the same visage as it did in the time of its founder. In the land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada holds sway, they hold their water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks and layfolk gather in observance, a rite of meaning and mystery, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such things. These shifts run deep, from the rituals on the surface to the very heart of soteriology. Through time, the Theravada community, whether clad in the robes of the monastic or the garments of the lay, has seen its teachings bend and alter. Forces from without and within, at times hostile, at other times indifferent, have left their mark.\n\nIn speaking of these changes, we find ourselves often returning to certain ideas. There is the notion of forces, internal and external. Internal, those born from within the Buddhasasana, whether monk or follower. External, those that come from beyond the Buddhist fold. Hostile, those that seek to harm, born of dark views against the doctrine. Benign, those that neither wish to help nor harm, though they may do so unwittingly. These terms will weave their way through this tale.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the essence of the faith—the doctrines at the heart of Theravada. The seekers of this path find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma stands upon the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical truths. Within these notions lie Anatta—the absence of self, Dukkha—the suffering woven into the fabric of life, and Anicca—the impermanence that clings to all things. To see these truths is to step from the endless wheel of Sansara, the dance of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, as enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the rules of living. For the layperson, there are five precepts: to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the monks, the rules are more numerous, a stricter path. At the core of it all lie the four noble truths. First, the truth of Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, the truth that clinging is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering can find its end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim corridors of human interaction, culture stands as a silent arbiter, casting its shadow over every negotiation. It's an entity defined as much by the void of what it is not as by the form of what it is, a specter neither singular nor unyielding. It resists the simplicity of broad strokes, eschewing the stereotypes that seek to contain it like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" Such declarations, in their sweeping generality, fail to capture the deeper essence. A negotiator, wise to the world’s ways, must peer beyond such superficial veneers, deciphering the intricate dance of cultural attitudes that sway the discourse at the table.\n\nAs one steps into the embrace of a foreign culture, it mirrors back an image refracted through the lens of one's own, compelling comparisons to emerge unbidden. To glimpse the soul of another culture is a journey through history and prejudice, a path laden with understanding rather than judgment. One does not seek to reshape this entity but to accept it, to maneuver within its confines, especially when the odds tilt against them. In lands not their own, respect for tradition and belief becomes the compass guiding them through the labyrinthine barriers of culture, propelling the negotiation forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach extends beyond borders, weaving its threads into the very fabric of corporate realms. A nation’s companies forge their own cultural identities, each as varied as the landscape itself. Some demand the grueling hours of toil, others embrace the ease of a more relaxed rhythm. Dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices become the tapestry through which this corporate culture is revealed. Even within a single country, the diversity of thought and practice from one company to another—and within regions of the same company—forms a mosaic of human endeavor. For those cultures that seem less stratified, whose surfaces appear seamless to the outsider, such uniformity merely beckons a deeper exploration.\n\nValues, those unseen currents, are the lifeblood of culture, revealing the why of its being. In a land where saving face or communal harmony reigns supreme, a negotiator will not sully the honor of his kin to win at the table. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, swift settlement is not the prize sought. These truths must be reckoned with before the first words are spoken in negotiation. Yet, the canny negotiator delves further, seeking to know the soul of his adversary, for in that personal knowing lies the power to shape destinies across the table.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So begins Psalm 14, casting its shadow over the minds of men who dare to ponder the divine. It marks the threshold of St. Anselm's questing for proof of a God who holds dominion over the hearts of the faithful. In this journey, Anselm is not alone. Thomas Aquinas walks beside him, both seeking a truth as old as time. And here we are tasked to weigh the worth of their words, to find whose voice rings clearer in the halls of faith and reason. We start with the presupposition of their shared belief, the God of the Bible, for to stray into realms of differently shaped deities would be to lose our way.\n\nNow, consider Anselm, who turns the gaze inward. He whispers that the proof is not out there but within, not in the stars or the stones but in the corridors of the mind. God exists, Anselm contends, because we cannot conceive of Him not existing. It is a subtle and winding path he lays, one that can tangle the unwary in its logic. Yet, there it stands, a monument to faith, a knowing that does not demand the crutch of evidence beyond the self. It is a belief borne of the soul's quiet conviction, that gentle whisper of faith that needs no louder proclamation.\n\nContrast this with the voice of Aquinas, who seeks a God not cloaked in mystery but revealed through the lens of reason. For Aquinas, faith is the seed, but reason is the tiller of the soil. He stands on the firm ground of logic, offering proofs like beads on a rosary: motion, cause, necessity, degree, and order. Each stringing together a tapestry of reason where the divine is the inevitable conclusion. In his hands, belief becomes a structure, as sure and solid as the stones of a cathedral, where faith is not a leap into the void but a step upon the firmament of understanding.\n\nYet, as we look upon these two, each with their truths and their failings, we find that neither alone holds the key to the kingdom. They are but paths converging on a mystery that remains just out of reach, a God perhaps known only in the spaces between faith and reason, in the quiet after the words have been spoken, and the silence where the heart rests.",
            "In the great sweep of Fitzgerald's tale, a world unfolds where colors bear the weight of meaning, casting shadows upon the lives they touch. There's a subtle alchemy in how he pairs words, and within this alchemy lies the truth of his craft. The Great Gatsby stands as a testament to the way Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of hues, each thread a whisper of intent. Colors like gold, green, white, and gray march across the pages, each with its own litany of significance. White and gray, especially, take on the guise of uniformity, white the finer, more genteel, while gray speaks of age and decline. They appear first on the scene as Daisy and Jordan drape themselves in white, a spectral hue that clings to them like innocence lost. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's revelry, Tom in a white shirt as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine powdered milky white. Even the city itself, New York's lower stretches, becomes a chasm of white, while the names of Gatsby's guests turn gray upon Nick's list, the very ink fading. \n\nFitzgerald's world is one where the ordinary, the unremarkable, wears white and gray. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood was white, a pale echo of their past. The valley of ashes sprawls gray, cars and land alike, the Italian child on the tracks is gray, the dog-seller a gray old man. The weight of these words builds until they become a code, marking what is unimportant, what is uniform, and what blends into the background of life's canvas. Daisy, in her white dresses, appears not as a woman of flesh and desire but as an ideal, a dream Gatsby clutches in his heart. Her presence is a gray haze, a white roadster, a white dress in the moments before confrontation. Fitzgerald paints her in these colors, a picture of a world that is less about the living and more about the longing, the uniformity that stretches like the gray land beneath an endless sky.",
            "In the sun-drenched expanse of San Diego County, the earth yields its bounty beneath a sky that knows no harshness. Tomatoes ripen under the gentle gaze of the sun, citrus and leafy greens unfurl their leaves to the light, and the land gives forth squash and broccoli, herbs and tree fruits, peaches and lemons and berries, all in their time. The honey is sweet and the peppers burn with the fire of the sun. There is a market here, a place where the folk gather, yearning for the fruits of organic labor, where eggs and milk from untamed lands find their way to tables. The land itself, these organic farms, they are open to the wanderer, offering paths for those who seek the solace of nature, the sight of birds in flight. Here, a landowner might find the grace of government favor, might improve the earth itself, might open the soil to the feet of the curious, the seekers of knowledge and of profit. \n\nYet there is a price to be paid. To farm the land without the crutch of chemicals is to walk a harder road. The labor is fierce and unending, the hands weary from the toil of pulling weeds and battling pests, of feeding the earth in ways that nature intended. The losses are keenly felt, for the small farmer lacks the might of the great agricultural machines. Still, there are those who plant cover crops, who rotate the grazing of beasts, who pull the invaders from the soil to let the native flora breathe. Here, too, the landowner might seek the wisdom of others, to learn how to weave together the threads of profit and preservation.\n\nThis tale unfolds on a tract of land near Potrero, in the unclaimed reaches of San Diego County. Spanning 160 acres, it lies in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, where chaparral and oak woodland meet the grasslands brought from across the sea. It is a place of many species, some of which teeter on the brink, like the Stephens’ kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, may soon follow them into the annals of the endangered. \n\nThis land was once the domain of those who came before, the Native Americans, and later the cattlemen and sellers of cordwood who carved their lives from the earth in the waning years of the nineteenth century. It was a piece of an original homestead, perhaps grazed by cattle, perhaps the source of wood for the hearths that once burned in the night.\n\nIn this story, I took a parcel from a digital ledger of land, studied the ways in which a small farmer might find aid from the hands of government, might preserve the wildness of the land while seeking to draw forth its bounty. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model of what might be, should one choose to walk this path.",
            "In the world there exists a bond between brothers, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared breath. A bond that is unyielding and eternal, carrying within it the weight of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. Brothers know each other with a knowing that runs deeper than the marrow of their bones, each seeing in the other a mirror of himself. In moments of desperation, the true fabric of this bond is revealed, whether it be woven of good or evil. These emotions, when laid bare, come with a toll heavy and inescapable. To understand the emotions entwined within this fraternal connection is to bear the burden of their consequences. To meet a brother's gaze is to peer into the depths of one's own soul, stripped of the masks worn for the world. It is in their deeds and their aftermath that one's true nature is found. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the two brothers walk this path, navigating the tempest of emotions that accompany them. Amidst a landscape rich and alive, they embark on a journey doomed from the start. In the end, the bitterness of disappointment and the fierce heat of pride collide, and only one brother emerges from the storm. This theme is etched through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the interplay between them, as well as the narrator's perspective, which casts light on the tangled web of feelings within the protagonist and his perception of the world, both of which cast shadows on his actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's deeds lies the singular force of pride. From the first breath he shares with his fragile brother, Doodle, to their last, ill-fated odyssey, resentment simmers within him. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, to teach him to hold breath beneath the water, to run, to leap, to climb the vines twisting through Old Woman Swamp. He craved a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch beside him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle's frailty, his heart too weak to bear the weight of life, let alone the thrill of racing and climbing. It was a cruel blow to the young boy, his mind a cauldron of wild imaginings, to have those visions snuffed out in an instant. Anger stirred within him, dark thoughts of smothering the life from the small child flickering across his mind. What child, you might ask, would harbor such thoughts? But then, the simple curve of Doodle's smile breaks through, softening the hardness in his heart. Such a small act, yet it kindled hope within the boy. It showed that his resolve was but a fleeting shadow. Somewhere deep within, there was an instinctive love for his brother, a love that whispered in the dark corners of his mind.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a maze of intricate pathways lies sprawling, where thoughts weave and meander like rivers through the dust of time. Once, in the dawn of man's understanding, the brain was likened to a simple wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a tome of knowledge bound in leather and ink, and now to the cold machinations of a machine, ever calculating, ever processing. But these are mere shadows and reflections, pale imitations of the truth, and one must tread carefully, for they can lead astray.\n\nThe world enters the mind through the senses, those ancient gatekeepers who transform the touch of skin, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, or the light of stars into the language of the soul, a tongue of electrochemical fire. This raw tapestry is then spun and woven by the brain's algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. Consider the image of a black box stark against a field of white; the bottom-up gaze gathers fragments of color and shape, marking the edges where darkness meets the light, and in this, finds a box. The top-down gaze, with the wisdom of steps taken before, might discern not a void but a solid shape, black as the night.\n\nThrough this complexity, an unseen hand, the attention filter, sifts through the noise and the chaos, deciding what shall pass and what shall fall away. It is why, among a sea of grass beneath your feet, each blade remains unseen, yet the call of your name pierces through the clamor of a crowded room, clear and true. The mind is a stage of unending acts, where attention is the director, guiding the play.\n\nBut before the mind can ponder, it must remember. Memory is the keeper of time, with chambers for the sensory, the fleeting, and the enduring. In the beginning, the world is etched into the mind, encoded in ways as varied as the senses themselves. A word can be known by its shape, its sound, or its meaning. Once etched, it is held in place, perhaps by the flicker of electricity through a web of neurons for the short-lived memories, or by the very structure of proteins for those that endure.\n\nThere are many who seek to chart this territory, some with the tools of science, others with the mind's own map, and still others through the study of the flesh itself. In the semantic network, ideas are stars in a constellation, each linked to another by the invisible threads of meaning. A chair to a table, a table to wood, and so the web is spun.\n\nAnd so it is, the mind, a great and terrible machine, ever turning, ever creating, a mystery that beckons and eludes.",
            "In the year of 2007, the United States found itself cast into a shadow of financial ruin. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market lay shattered, and the great titans of industry stood as hollowed shells upon the landscape of commerce. This recession, relentless and unyielding, marches on even now. And so we ask, how did this calamity come to pass, and what might we do to halt its advance? In the starkest terms, it was the folly of political minds, driven by self-interest and devoid of foresight, that compelled banks and firms to peddle subprime loans into a financial system not yet grown to withstand such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giants in the world of mortgages, were goaded into weaving these precarious loans into the fabric of CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers faltered, as they inevitably did, the banks found their coffers bare, and the chaos spread outwards, touching every corner of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this turmoil were sown in the twilight years of the last century, during the reign of Clinton. A President, eager to find favor and extend his grasp on power, loosened the chains of lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the disaster that would follow. It was Steven Holmes of the New York Times who wrote in 1999 of the pressure upon Fannie Mae to open the gates of homeownership to those of lesser means, a pressure that stemmed from both the administration and the hunger of shareholders for ever-growing profit. He saw with clarity the peril that lay ahead, predicting the need for a rescue akin to that which had come before in the days of the savings and loan crisis. And so it was that the reckless granting of loans would, as foretold, lead to the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe fabric of the financial world had become a tangle of complexity, as mortgages took on new and bewildering forms. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations wove together, binding more and more of the economy to the fate of the housing market. Households and financial entities alike found themselves overextended, standing precariously upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of fortune.\n\nThe bubble, of course, did burst, and those institutions that had wagered upon the solidity of these mortgage-backed securities were left to reckon with their folly. By 2007, the top five investment banks bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation’s economic output. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch found themselves sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs alongside Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the shackles of commercial banking, bound by stringent oversight. As for Fannie and Freddie, they were engulfed in a sea of $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and by September of 2008, they too were brought under the yoke of government control.",
            "The tale unfolds and there is a place where the words must bear the weight of the story. Stretching out like a lone hawk in the morning sky, hoping to capture the breath of those who linger on the page. Or else it is the place where the eyes grow heavy and the mind drifts away, leaving curses in their wake. Dr. Merlin, it is said, would growl at the screen when caught amid a deluge of needless words, not even of the entertaining sort.\n\nExposition, the betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThose who take kindly to the craft of writing know well the old adage, \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, Dr. Merlin finds herself entangled in long, barren passages where little stirs or too much overwhelms. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay the groundwork of history swiftly so the tale might move to brighter pastures (not to be confused with that other whisper, the one that tempts you to divulge every chapter of each character's past).\n\nExposition is the telling of what transpired, often laid bare in simple words. In the moving pictures, it is when one soul imparts to another a torrent of narrative, like some ancient mariner's tale. In the written word, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nTake this for instance. As you turn the pages of a story, you are told the maiden met her love in a certain place at a certain time, that they wed amidst splendor, and that he fell, slain, before her eyes. You would not reckon this tale to be spun in but two pages, with a mere scattering of their words. You would hope the writer would linger on the husband's nature, revealing through his voice and gesture the depth of his love, and you would expect the heroine to show, through the great and small, how his being in her life had transformed and enriched it (especially if the tale later claims this to be so). A rightful introduction to the husband would bind you to his fate and grant you insight into the woman he cherished: what she perceived in him, how their bond was forged, hints of her own musings and dreams as mirrored in his gaze, and so on. You would grieve his loss with her and thus draw closer to her very soul.\n\nIn essence, you would seek the marrow upon the bare bone of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a keeper of stories, it is upon you to provide that marrow. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, carries on*) There is often the urge to hasten over things unremarkable. You might bring forth a new character, knowing he once served in the Air Force, now oversees a gas station by night, wed twice, childless, a fisherman on lazy weekends, harboring a quiet hope to one day own that very gas station, and had Eggs Benedict to start his day.",
            "In the gray dawn of the day, the news flickered on the screen like a silent oracle, casting shadows of the world beyond. From Columbus, Ohio, the stories unfolded, each one a testament to the darkness that lay beneath the surface of our lives. The first, a tale of violence in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had turned his hand against his own flesh. His wife's name was a secret kept by the ether, but his face, captured in the cold eye of the camera, was a portrait of malevolence. The tale was brief, a mere whisper of the horror that had transpired, yet it lingered in the mind like a specter.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, whose life was hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods area, a place marked by the absence of justice. The SWAT team scoured the shadows for answers, but the silence was unbroken. The brevity of this telling, a reflection of a world where the color of one's skin determined the weight of one's story. The media, a fickle beast, often turned a blind eye to the plight of those whose skin was dark as night, their cries for justice swallowed by the indifference of the world.\n\nA gunshot, like a distant thunder, had marred the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet from a .22 caliber rifle the culprit. The promise of gold, five thousand dollars' worth, hung in the air for those who could unravel the mystery. The news moved on, swift as a river, to the coming storms, the promise of rain and thunder hanging over the city like a shroud, the temperatures a mere footnote in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThere was talk of a robbery, a dark-skinned man cloaked in a hooded garment, his presence described in detail, the color of his skin a note played over and again. The emphasis on his darkness, a reminder of the biases that ran deep in the veins of society.\n\nAnd then, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man from Texas whose life had been a dance with the devil of drugs. His fate sealed with a sentence of twenty-five years, spoken in the strange tongue of \"300 months,\" as if the weight of his punishment could be shifted by the turning of words. His heritage, Hispanic, was noted, though it seemed but a shadow in the grand narrative of his crimes.\n\nThe stories, like footprints in the ash, lingered in the mind, each one a reminder of the world as it was, a place where the past and present wove together in a tapestry of light and shadow.",
            "In the world of finance where shadows lengthen and figures shift, there exists a thing called an ETF. A creature not unlike an exchange traded fund, born to follow the trails of indices or commodities or a basket of assets. Like a wandering hound on the scent, its nature is fluid, trading as it does like a stock upon the open market. It bears within it the breadth of an index fund, yet clutches the singularity of a lone stock, offering the promise of short selling, buying on margin, and the purchase of a solitary share. These lures glitter like gold in the eyes of the seeker. The expense ratios of these ETFs are lean, far leaner than the average mutual fund, a siren's song to the thrifty. Yet, alongside these boons lie the thorns, for one must pay a commission as one would with any stock. There lies another promise in the wide array of funds, spread vast like the prairie. But the wise investor knows to tread with care, to discern if these proclaimed virtues like diversification hold true, and to what degree they do. Our gaze will rest upon the ETF known as IHF, setting it against the top ten holdings that form its backbone, seeking to unravel whether the merits of a single ETF compare to the bounty of a diversified collection of ten stocks, and if within the same stocks there lies a better arrangement, a sharper edge or return.\n\nTo weigh the worth of the ETF, it becomes a task too great to encompass every holding, and so we choose to focus on the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's essence. These ten stand as pillars, and their percentage of the whole is etched below.\n\nTo glean an understanding of how these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF in its entirety, we take their current share of the assets, normalized to a full circle, to determine the weight each carries in a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it made solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it emerges that a portfolio graced only by the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in the harvest. The Beta too is lighter, by .12, than that of the ETF whole. Thus far, it seems that a gathering of merely the top ten holdings might offer a richer return with a gentler Beta. Yet, there hovers the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not worlds apart in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different in the eyes of numbers, the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks is measured and set to a full hundred, to compare their collective deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "They saw the drop in the numbers of those who logged their journeys and it fell like a cold shadow cast across the third month of the endeavor. And there was no ready answer to the question why. Perhaps it was the winter's breath, chilling the bones of those who would walk or ride, a New England campus silent beneath its frost. Or it was the end of things, of semesters and the harried souls racing to finish what they had started, grades to be meted out like judgments in the cold light of December. The logs, forgotten perhaps, lost among the myriad tasks that beset them. And there was the coming of the season of festivities where the world turned inward and the campus lay fallow, its halls hollow and empty, a month-long slumber before the year's turning and the classes resumed. Thus, the logs lay scarce in February, a mystery unsolved. The fervor of beginnings had waned, the flame guttering, as such things do. And so there came the Carpool Challenge, a rallying cry to stir the hearts once more, a March campaign swift and bright and it did bring forth an increase, though the challenge remained as before, how to sustain the breath of life in this endeavor against the tides of indifference and the rhythms of the academic calendar.\n\nYet there was another truth, buried deep, the love of the open road and the solitary freedom it promised. The car, a symbol of independence, unyielding in its cultural roots. Incentives were offered, tokens of gratitude in the form of gift cards, small treasures for the weary traveler, to the local stores and cafes, a balm for the soul. But one wonders what greater prizes might have wrought, a bicycle perhaps, or the promise of a hybrid or electric car. These fantasies might have drawn forth those who hesitated, kindling a new fire where the old had waned. The prizes, unchanging, might have held more allure had they grown in worth with each passing month. To announce in the heart of December a grand reward would have surely quickened the pace of those who had grown tired. One can only ponder what might have been, had the stakes been raised and the call to action resounded more fervently amidst the cold and quiet of the year’s end.",
            "In the gloom of the Library of Congress, I found myself poring over the early Edison films, drawn to their trickery like a moth to a forgotten flame. Fifteen they were, from the dying whispers of the nineteenth century to the first murmurs of the twentieth. Films that played with the mind's eye, slipping reality through the cracks of the reel with a sleight of hand born of clever editing. My journey through these shadows aimed to uncover the poetic threads binding these films, and to sift through the dust for those rare gems that dared to step beyond their time-worn bounds. \n\nAt the turn of the century, most trick films were bound to their sets, framed by the rigid proscenium, the camera a watchful sentinel that never moved, holding fast to its creed of one shot, one film. Yet, there were those brave few that inched towards the dawn of a new era, introducing a dance of multiple shots that whispered of change.\n\nWhat they shared, these trick films, was a devotion to the interior, a stage where the camera stood steadfast. No pursuit of figures, no shift in view, for the lens was rooted in its theatrical past, echoing the vaudeville and magic acts that had preceded it. Movement was but a lateral waltz, a side-to-side glide with no venture towards the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors drift from the right, skimming the stage like ghosts, never drawing the camera from its fixed gaze.\n\nThe proscenium's embrace meant long shots reigned supreme, with medium shots as rare companions, and the intimacy of close-ups was a stranger. The theater's influence was strong, its essence distilled into every frame, where the audience's gaze was framed by the stage's boundary. Actors held their ground, neither advancing nor retreating, leaving the close-up an untapped well.\n\nIn those early days, trick films held to the notion that one conceptual shot was a film entire. A constraint that kept their tales brief, their magic confined to a minute's breath, dictated by the frames per second. Their narratives were simple conjurings, vanishing acts, and clever exchanges without the weight of story. Yet, within the illusion of a single shot, lay the hidden seams of multiple, stitched together to conjure apparitions. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). At first glance, a seamless vision, yet upon closer inspection, the moment of trickery reveals itself, the shift where Mary's severed head begins its deceit, though to the viewer, it remains a singular shot.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, where the past meets the present, the Gothic Novel stands as a paradox, an old-new amalgamation that Ian Watt has called an oxymoron in his exploration, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic spirit, like an ancient shadow, has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of shallowness yet revered for its terrible and sublime essence, as Burke once noted. The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole's creation, emerged from this twilight, a fusion of the ancient and the modern, carving a path for the Gothic genre, a new voice in the wilderness of literature. Walpole drew from the \"old\" theatrics and the 'new' mimicry of nature, weaving them into what he proclaimed \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre borrows heavily from the medieval, a nod to the gothic theater, architecture, and traditions of yore. Even then, the word \"gothic\" was a ghost from many pasts, a descriptor for peoples, styles, epochs, carrying the weight of the archaic and the unsophisticated against the tide of modernity. It is this blend of the theatrical Gothic with the new novel's intimate lens on human psychology that has allowed the Gothic to linger through the ages, becoming both a relic and a revelation to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmidst these shadows, the notion of Chivalry rises, like a specter in the Gothic tales. This medieval code, the making of a knight, survives and transforms in The Castle of Otranto, that first Gothic novel. Chivalry held a mirror to the Gothic writers, reflecting the noble knight, brave and honorable, a mirror to what they believed was missing in their world. Through chivalric ideals, the Gothic past is painted in romantic hues, a wistful look forward to Romanticism, an endeavor to mend the present's fractures. Walpole, in the storm of political unrest, looked back at the noble silhouettes of history, despairing at the shadows of his own time. Engulfed in the political turmoil and accusations, his mind turned, perhaps unconsciously, to the lost moral compass and goodness of the Gothic age, absent in his society. This longing is etched in his characters, especially in Frederic, a figure of chivalry, whose reputation precedes him. Frederic steps from the pages, a prince forged in adversity, a tragic figure believed slain by infidels. His image is crafted with chivalric strokes, exaggerated in a way that heralds the Gothic's love for excess, a hallmark to come.",
            "In the bare bones of commerce lies the great machinery of supply chain management, an endless march of goods from the moment a customer dreams of them to their birth in the raw and unformed. It was in the early days of 1982 when a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant, named this stream of processes. He spoke of it as one might speak of a river, a flow of planning and executing and controlling the journey that goods must take, all to sate the needs of the waiting customer. Six are the pillars on which this chain rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers, like ancient alchemists, wield these elements to craft a service that meets the restless demands of those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first note in this symphony of commerce, stands as the bedrock of the supply chain. It is here that the questions of when and why and where and how ring out, echoing in the minds of those who must decide. The market, a fickle beast, whispers its demands, and the managers listen with intent, deciphering the wants of the masses. With their ears to this ground, they set about determining what must be made, and in what numbers. The place of creation is chosen with care, a factory or plant that promises both volume and quality, all in the pursuit of the customer’s satisfaction. Once the ground is laid, the managers turn their eyes to the scheduling of tasks and the upkeep of the machines that will bring their plans to life. In this meticulous dance, every step is crucial, for a misstep could cost dearly in time and gold. I have seen the inner workings of places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest detail is mapped, from the color of an employee’s shirt to the route a truck must take. Such plans are the lifeblood of a company, ensuring a smooth course free of confusion and discord.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, stands as a testament to the art of decision-making. Here, the strategic minds ponder the core strengths of their facilities, choosing partnerships for outsourcing that will bolster these strengths. In this complex web, a single product may owe its existence to many hands, each division a world unto itself with its own tools and craftsmen. The manager stands as a conductor, deciding which division will play which part, or whether another company should join the orchestra. The heart of this decision is velocity, the power to deliver speed and quality while keeping costs low, a feat much sought after in the halls of business.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of the Victorian age, where the light plays tricks on the eyes and the echo of footsteps is swallowed by the darkness, there are novels that step away from the gilded halls of aristocracy to wander in the terrain of the unknown. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, they are called. Each a vessel of mystery and the uncanny, diverging from the well-trodden path, their characters emerging from the shadows with motives laid bare by the fires of the bizarre.\n\nThe words came at him like a storm, a cacophony of voices and sounds that smothered the air around him. Between Sikes and Crackit he walked, their quarrel ringing in his ears, his own voice mingling with theirs in the fog of his mind. And then, the crack of gunfire, and the world erupted in chaos, a whirl of cries and lights that seared his vision as a phantom hand pulled him away. Amidst this tempest, a dull ache gnawed at him, relentless and unforgiving. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn such tales, the dream is a doorway, a passageway where reality bends and the soul's torment is laid out in stark relief. In Oliver’s world, dreams are a revelation of his inner turmoil, a canvas painted with the colors of his suffering and his awakening to the world’s cruel truths. Chapter 28 finds him immersed in the memory of gunfire, caught in a dream's embrace, seeking refuge yet finding none. The scene unfolds with a sense of helplessness, the grip of fate tight and unyielding. The specters of Sikes and Crackit haunt him, specters born of fear and powerlessness. He is swept away by forces unseen, his senses dulled, pain and dread entwined. Here lies the heart of Oliver’s struggle: the absence of agency, the chains of destiny that bind him, rendering him a passive witness to his own life's unraveling. The specter of Fagin looms large, a shadow cast over Oliver's spirit, whispering resignation into his ear, sapping the will to resist. For in these moments, the boy's struggle is not just with the world, but with the creeping despair that seeks to claim him.\n\nThe hours crept by - a day passed, if it could be called day at all, swallowed by the night that followed. Night stretched on, a silent eternity, yet fleeting in its passing, a passage through the void, the minutes fleeing like shadows from the light.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the halls of a school, an after-hours sanctuary for young minds, lending what aid I could to children finding their way through the murk of learning. My charge was to guide them, these small seekers, in subjects that gave them pause. My own strength lay in the words and the stories they told. Among them was a boy called Adrian, small of stature, perhaps third or fourth grade, facing a peculiar struggle with the written word. Some letters he grasped with ease, others slipped through his understanding like sand through fingers. It puzzled me, for he spoke the language with flawless clarity, though his heritage was Latino. We wrestled with the words until one day his mother came, speaking only in her native tongue, and the truth struck me with the force of revelation. The boy knew the words, but not the symbols of the language they formed. In that moment, a knowledge settled in me, and I could only hope it helped him find his way.\n\nThis tale I share not for its own sake but to lay bare the silent walls that rise in our schools, here in this sun-baked land of California. A barrier not of bricks but of tongues. It is a truth hidden in plain sight, that a child may speak the language and yet be a stranger to its written form. The question we must ask is not if this wall exists, for it surely does, but how we might breach it. For Adrian, a path lay in the letters and sounds that eluded him. Yet for others, those who know not the language of this land, the answer is not so simple. There is no solitary cure. The dual language, the immersion in the mainstream, the private guides, the classes of English as a second tongue—none alone will tear down this wall. It is in their union that hope lies.\n\nTo take the dual language path is to open doors not only for those whose first words were in the songs of Spanish but for all children. Such programs have shown their worth, their students rising above their peers. Yet fear shadows their implementation, whispers that they waste what cannot be squandered, that the many reap no reward. But these fears are unfounded. Were we to embrace such learning as common practice, all would find enrichment. The question remains, how? Must every teacher speak in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. Yet there is no reason we cannot place among them those who do, as aides or tutors, guides fluent in the languages of many.",
            "Since those first glimmers of awareness, the notion has been seeded in us that something larger, ineffable, stands beyond the edge of our understanding. Some are led to sit in pews and listen for whispers of the divine, while others search within, grasping at the shadows of their own souls. Many cling to the faith of their forebears, worn paths trodden by countless feet before them. And yet, there are those who turn their backs on such teachings, declaring their own small world the measure of all things. We may take up one creed only to cast it aside for another, as if the truth were a garment that could be changed with the seasons. Whatever road we walk, we strive to carve out a niche for ourselves, seeking the flicker of light that promises to guide us from the depths of night into the warmth of day.\n\nA cardinal, my father murmured, when I questioned him about his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming a relentless rhythm atop the tin roof, each of us with a cigarette between our fingers. The gutters spewed torrents, drowning the greenery that bordered the porch's edge. His gaze was lost in the rain, a look that seemed to drift between the past and some uncharted horizon. Over the months, he'd dwindled, his clothes hanging loose as though they belonged to another, his hair thinned like a memory fading. He kept his eyes on the rain, as if meeting mine would somehow anchor his spirit. I felt the silence between us, a chasm I dared not cross, for to speak of departure would make it so. I reached for him, drew closer, and together we watched the rain fall in the waning light of June.\n\nHe slipped away in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments had bought him time, though what worth was time when pain was its currency, I could not fathom. What deity, I wondered in the lonely dark, would weave such a tapestry of suffering? I found no solace in prayers spent on deaf ears, convinced that if God ever listened, He'd long since turned away.\n\nI could not bear witness to that final breath, the extinguishing of the life that had given me mine. I refused to see him as he waned, preferring the echoes of his laughter to the silence of his end. I knew him better than the others did, knew he would not want me there, watching as he drifted into the unknown. I folded myself into my bed and let the world pass by, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nBut no call ever came.",
            "In the shadowed expanse of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a figure carved from the very soil he tended. An advocate for Republicanism, his roots were deep in the land, an agriculturalist by nature and a man for whom the earth was both a canvas and a creed. His brief sojourn into the realm of politics did not temper his voice, one of outspoken fervor for the freedom of the individual and the restraint of government. His heart beat for the agrarian life, a rhythm that guided his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the courts that ruled the land.\n\nTaylor saw this young nation, the United States, as a blank slate, untouched by the ancient traditions that bound older lands. Here was a chance to craft an ideal, to birth a system where self-governance could flourish. He held fast to the notion that the rights of man were natural and intertwined, each reliant on the other. Deny one, and the whole would crumble, their worth diminished. Thus, these rights must lie beyond the grasp of government. In the state of nature, he said, it was the strong and the cunning who thrived, but civilization demanded a different order.\n\nTo forge this dream, Taylor knew a government must reckon with the dual nature of man, both virtuous and vile. He spoke of a dual morality, where every virtue and vice of governance was but a reflection of humanity itself. Good governance, Taylor declared, safeguarded private property, nurtured the land, and spurned the greedy clutches of capitalism. Such a government, built on principles true and just, would stand steady, even as those who led it succumbed to greed and self-interest. For Taylor, self-interest was the engine of man, only darkened when it bred societies that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant government was needed to chain man's inherent evil, ever watchful to exclude the bad.\n\nIn the company of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a document that, to him, should bind the Federal government in chains of explicit limits. He saw the sprawl of Federal power as a costly path to despotism. Yet he warned against a simple literalism, for without the spirit of the Founders' intentions, such readings could twist to corruption. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, for it spoke of sovereign states bound together, not as one monolith, but as a gathering of equals.",
            "He stood there, gaze fixed downward, seeing but not seeing, his mind a void that absorbed the view without judgment or understanding. The practiced eye of a man who had long since learned to separate the sight from the meaning, a mind that cataloged what it saw but refused to know it, thoughts slipping like whispers through the dark, as if they were not thoughts at all but a mere murmuring of experience washing over him with the ease of a brook over stones.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a moment of whim, he had taken the advice of an artist friend and bought a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. A book meant to teach one the art of seeing, of understanding the world through the tip of a pencil, through the lens of line and form. It spoke of frames, of ways to distill the chaos of the world—a bowl of fruit in the cluttered sprawl of a kitchen—into something simple, something graspable, a bowl on a table in a realm of its own.\n\nYet now, as he stood over the bowl before him, he found no such frame to enclose his sight. There was only the vastness of his awe, a vision too full to be contained. The masters had their colors—Picasso his blues, Monet his greens, those artists of old basking in their prismatic glory. But here, if there was to be any art to his vision, it was the art of brown. This was the canvas spread before him, the genesis of his own peculiar masterpiece.\n\nHis fingers settled upon the tool of his creation, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind finding shape in action. Water swirled beneath him, a dance of clarity and calm, carrying with it the fragments of what had been. Again his hand struck, more frantic now, commanding the handle with insistence. But still the stubborn brown form clung to the bottom of the porcelain, unmoved, defiant.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted firm, the tie at his throat a strangling knot of green. A slight frown creased his brow as he regarded the insolent mass left behind by some nameless soul—a message in waste for the weary keepers of the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, winding it round and round until his hand was swathed like some ancient embalmed thing. He straightened, then bent low, his hand descending into the bowl with the careful grace of a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving feast.",
            "The young ones are dying out there on the roads, a grim tally kept by fate and folly. This confluence of hazard, this grim conjoining of statistics, finds its root in the unready minds of the youngest among us. The National Institutes of Health tells a tale of brains not yet ripened for the perils of the road. Inexperience, too, sits heavy at the heart of this dark matter. It is this lack of knowing that leads them astray, to more deaths, to the rolling of vehicles, to the speed that sings of oblivion, to roadsides that catch them unawares.\n\nThey fare worse when traveling in packs, these youths, for they are wont to gather and ride, heedless of the danger. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has mapped the correlation between the age of those who sit beside them and the wreckage left in their wake.\n\nCalifornia and other lands have sought to mend this with temporary measures, provisional licenses that bind the hours of their travels and put a stop to the bearing of fellow minors as passengers.\n\nYet these provisional licenses are but a finger in the dam. The root lies deeper, for by all measures, these young souls are not yet fit to shoulder the burdens of the open road. Marvin Zuckerman, a student of the mind, speaks of eighteen as still too tender an age for such liberty. USA Today bears witness to his findings, the yearning of those not yet reached the age of nineteen, to court risk for the thrill it brings. It stands to reason that patience might temper this seeking, that time might dull the edge of their recklessness.\n\nShould we continue to hand the keys to the young, we shall see the grim harvest continue, the toll rising to heights yet unimagined. Come 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood these roads, a legion of new drivers eager to test their mettle.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this is a simple enough matter. Schools might still lay the groundwork with their teachings, yet none under eighteen should know the power that lies beneath their feet. A provisional permit might yet precede the granting of full license, demanding a measure of training that echoes the standards of states such as California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nFor the numbers that haunt us come from every corner of the land, and a single, unified decree could stand as a bulwark against this tide. What I propose is no new thing, but it is a thing that must be done.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies a disorder called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a shadowy realm where the brain struggles to sift through the sounds that life throws its way. This disorder, as defined by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, concerns itself with the central nervous system's ability to process auditory information, a process that is both delicate and mysterious. For those who wander this path, the hearing is not the issue. They hear as others do, yet the mind falters, unable to untangle the threads of sound from the tapestry of existence.\n\nThe whispers of CAPD trace back to the mid-twentieth century, to a time when it was but a fledgling thought, a disorder known then as auditory imperception. It was the Italians, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who began to unravel its secrets, crafting tests in the year of 1954. By 1961, Kimura had stepped into the fray, introducing methods to probe the dichotic nature of perception, revealing the complex physiology beneath. A gathering of minds in 1977 stirred the air with new questions, new paths to tread.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. Those it touches may find themselves adrift in space, unable to pinpoint a sound's origin or distinguish one sound from a chorus of noise. Patterns slip through their fingers, the subtle shifts in speech lost to them like whispers in the wind. Sounds can clash, one blotting out the next, leaving them without the clarity they seek. The sequence of sound eludes them, a puzzle unsolved, a story untold.\n\nTo diagnose this elusive disorder, one must embark on a journey of observation and testing. Audiologists and psychologists, with their tools and measures, seek to peel back the layers of auditory behavior, to understand how the patient responds to the world of sound. Yet, the road remains uncertain. No single test shines a light on CAPD's depths, and its origins are shrouded in mystery. Tests, both simple and complex, ask the patient to separate the cacophony, to find meaning in a series of spoken words or numbers. More intricate examinations delve into the ear's acoustics, measuring the echoes of sound within.\n\nAnd so, the understanding of CAPD continues, a flickering light in the vast darkness of the human mind.",
            "In the pursuit of a life in social work, I find myself drawn toward the path that leads to the Division of Family and Children Services. A path that promises the chance to stand sentinel for those children cast into the shadows of abuse and neglect. A place where troubled families seek refuge and understanding. It is here I aim to lay down the values I hold dear: service to others, respect for every soul, an ethical compass unwavering, a commitment to mend the fractured bonds between people, and an ongoing quest to refine my own professional competence. These are not mere tenets of social work; they are the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nThe urge to help others has been a constant whisper in my heart, even as the path forward lay obscured by uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the long halls of college, I witnessed souls grappling with their own ghosts, some fleeing in denial, others resorting to means that offered no peace. It was these encounters that nudged me toward a Bachelor's in Psychology. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in the year 2009, the road ahead remained a mystery. That summer, a friend led me to a trembling boy of sixteen, perched on her couch, seeking refuge from the storm that was his parents. The next day, he called upon the law to intervene. I followed the call to his home, a silent observer with a newly minted degree in Psychology. The officers, bound by the limits of the law, turned to me. I spoke with the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses painting their son's actions as mere manipulation. This encounter, fraught with the tension of 'simple' disputes, set me on the course toward social work, a calling to aid those ensnared in familial strife.\n\nSocial justice stands as another pillar in the field of social work. In our society, we exalt the individual and lament those who slip through our grasp. Yet, this notion of the individual often bows to antiquated traditions rather than true singularity. If society mourns the lost, why then do we strive for sameness? I walk this earth as my own being, unshackled by the chains of conformity. In my time at high school and college, I opposed injustice with every fiber of my being: my hair a canvas of unnatural hues, my attire a reflection of self, my ears adorned beyond convention, my voice loud in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), my stand firm against racism and discrimination wherever they dared to show their face. I believe in the fight for social justice and vow to continue my protest against its absence.\n\nAnd so, with each step forward, I carry these truths with me, a testament to the path I aspire to walk, a life dedicated to the service of others, to justice, and to the betterment of the world around me.",
            "The paper you hold is a discourse on the models that bind insomnia to the biological and the sociocultural realms. In the biological sphere, the threads of genetics and the medical weave hold their sway. The sociocultural, in its turn, casts its eye upon the bonds of environment, peering into the depths of race, of ethnicity, of the very fabric of society itself. This review, it dares to uncover, to lay bare the models, to dissect the very heart of the research that lends them voice. In the findings, strengths are revealed, weaknesses too, each one unmasked in the cold light of critique.\n\nA disorder of sleep, it is said, can be known by its kin: a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or yet another tied to the body or the bane of substances. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias claim their place in this pantheon. Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, those that warp the breath in sleep, the rhythms of the circadian, and those that stand unnamed. Insomnia, it holds sleep at bay, while Hypersomnia battles to keep the eye unshuttered, both for the span of a month. Narcolepsy, the thief of wakefulness, brings cataplexy and the dream that comes unbidden. The Parasomnias, they walk in the night, bringing nightmares, terrors, movements of sleepwalking, and more that elude the tongue’s grasp. The disorders they link to the mind's troubles, Axis I and Axis II, they too are part of this tale. And so this review draws its focus on insomnia, and the primary disorders of sleep, through the lens of biology and socioculture.\n\nThe biological model, it speaks of genes, of inheritance, of the body's own tale in the disorder of sleep. The neurons, the orexin they bear, lie in the hypothalamus, guardians of the cycle of sleep and waking. The study, it took mice as its muse, and found phenotypic GABAB receptors on those neurons of orexin, bearers of the sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when roused, it calls forth sleep. If its fire is quenched, anxiety flees, and sleep is welcomed. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, it lengthened the sleep of the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, a tale is spun that the mice may yet tell of human sleep. Here is seen the intertwining of genes and the world without, in the GABAB receptor of the human kind. A flaw in this receptor’s tale, and sleep may be lost without the aid of medicine. The sociocultural thread, it whispers of inheritance, of phenotypes guiding sleep, and the twisted tale of a receptor marred. It speaks of the shadows cast upon life, upon learning, upon labor, upon the endless tasks of the day when focus is adrift.",
            "He'd been a student there at University Park for what seemed like the turn of two and a half years, or perhaps four and a half semesters if one reckoned by the calendar of the school. For many who roamed those grounds, himself among them, the very act of moving from place to place was a burden. In that first year they'd placed him in an East Halls dormitory, a place far flung as if it sought to escape the bounds of the campus altogether, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center beyond. The journey from his abode in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning at Willard, which lay nearer the heart of the grounds, could consume a good twenty-five minutes by foot. And that on a day when the skies did not conspire against him, as they so often did in State College. An older alum, not many seasons ahead of him, had spoken of a time when those dorms were cut off by vast stretches of barren land. Now that space had been claimed, filled with fields of sport, towering edifices like the new Creamery, and buildings for health, and all circled by apartments like sentinels. As the campus swelled, the struggle to navigate it grew ever more profound. What remedy for this ailment of movement? A simple thing it seemed, the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone was no panacea. It required the will of students to ride and a campus shaped to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend who had taken up bicycling once more after some years' neglect. The friend mused aloud, baffled by his own abandonment of such a noble steed. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said. \"For a while, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the sole way to traverse this place.\" For the body it was a boon, and for travel, unmatched in its efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some sweat of the brow and a man could cover thirty miles or more. Like many drawn from the dormitories, he now dwelled off campus, no nearer the center than some halls of residence. This year, he'd made the wise choice to purchase a bicycle. Each day brought him to Thomas building, an easy twenty-five-minute walk if he let his legs decide the pace. Yet with the bicycle, he could cut that journey to five if he pushed the pedals hard. But there was Pollock Road, the most direct path, and not always an easy passage, be it on a bike or on foot. Walking had its own merits, true, but time was a luxury he could not afford. Without that bicycle, he'd be bound to walk, and that daily trek would steal another thirty to forty minutes from his hours. Over a week, he'd be losing more than two and a half hours. And more yet if he counted the other journeys to classes and appointments and such. Time he could ill spare in the days allotted to him.",
            "In the somber landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the specter of technology looms large, its great shadow cast by the capitalist machinations that bind it. Here lies a world where the community smothers the individual, and the pursuit of fleeting happiness is a creed whispered into the ear from birth. A populace molded into pawns, their lives governed by the unseen hand of the World Controller, their thoughts tethered to a single dogma. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one might discern Huxley’s deep-seated wariness of these burgeoning constructs. Terms born of Marxism—homogeny, reification—dance through the narrative, underscoring Huxley’s critique of the economic tides of his era.\n\nThe satire of capitalism unfurls in the guise of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that cloaks the masses from understanding their true standing among the economic strata. They are ensnared by the lure of personal gain, their sight blinded by the ideological chains that bind the proletariat and laborers, mirrored in the conditioning suffered by the denizens of Huxley’s world. The Deltas, the Gammas, each class stripped of will, their minds reshaped by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to revel in excess as ordained by the World Controller. The grip of hegemony encircles them, a specter of domination wherein the lower classes remain oblivious to their own subjugation, buying into an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism. The Alphas and Betas, birthed with the awareness of their bondage, remain inert, save for the few like Bernard who dare to question. The dance of social classes, a tapestry of oppression under the capitalist yoke, unfolds with stark clarity.\n\nIn this world, the ties that bind disparate souls unravel, the novel refusing to grant its characters the nuance of depth. Huxley’s hand perhaps suggesting that the ascent of technology and capitalism strips man of his soul and voice. Love is a phantom, and emotion a shadow—interactions rendered shallow, as men speak of women in terms of their pneumatic allure, and women recount their liaisons with unabashed candor. The complacency of each class in their societal rung echoes the economic tendrils of capitalism. Their unyielding allegiance to their role within the hive mind mirrors Marxist insights into the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy so long as they consume, adhere, and march in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC. A class filled with voices rising and falling over a single question that seemed to stretch beyond the walls of the room: Is Islam a hostile religion? Such a question now, in these days, seems more pressing than ever. From the shadows of 9/11, I have watched the media's gaze shift. Once, it looked upon Islam with fear, with suspicion, but now it seems to have swung to a strange patience, a tolerance not easily understood. Hard to imagine in those days of 2001 that a man like Barack Obama, bearing a name tethered to a Muslim lineage, could stride into the arena of presidential ambition.\n\nThe Prophet's life, in its telling, intrigued me. A biography that seemed to run against the grain of what I had come to know of Muhammad. I had thought him a man who bent others to his will, who took tribes and made them kneel to the creed of Islam. Yet, in those pages, he was cast anew, a martyr misunderstood, humbling himself before others, the truth of his teachings drawing the people to him one by one.\n\nThere are lines drawn between the stories of Jesus and the so-called miracles of Muhammad that are difficult to ignore. In the tale where he multiplied mutton and milk until forty men had eaten their fill, I see an attempt to paint him as a prophet who walked in truth and miracles, needing nothing more to prove his worth. It feels a theft, a shadow cast over the light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to weave the life of one into the fabric of another's legend.\n\nThe biography is threaded with tales that speak of conversions, of witnesses coming to the truth of their own accord. Yet these stories seem spun from hearsay, tales told by those who heard from another and another still. It is a thing that sits uneasily with me, for while it seeks to stand as proof, it leaves a shadow of doubt, a whisper of suspicion.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the way they lift Muhammad, setting him upon a pedestal as a man of divine grace, humble and wise. Yet history casts another light, one that tells of a rise to power that speaks little of gentleness. I wonder if those who follow him today know this history that lies beneath the surface of his story.",
            "In the twilight of beliefs where the gospels were first whispered, the teachings of Jesus lay like stones in a streambed, unmoved and unheeded as the waters of Christian thought rushed past in their ceaseless journey. With the passage of time, the river of faith meandered, leaving behind the roots that anchored its beginning. Through the ages, you can see the world of Christianity diverging from its primal path, like travelers who have lost their way. Yet now, in the looming present, there is a rumbling beneath the earth, a stirring of the spirit that speaks of return. The old ways hold firm like ancient oaks in a restless forest, but the winds of change are strong, and they whisper of a coming day when history shall turn upon itself. \n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will find themselves drawn to the echoes of their faith's origins, yearning to strip away the layers of doctrine that have gathered like dust upon an ancient artifact. This slow revelation will be as inexorable as the tide, a movement that pares back the centuries until only the essence of Jesus’ message remains, unmarred by the hands of time. Across the lands of America and Europe, the faithful will rise like shadows at dawn, seeking a purer communion. The church will stand as a bastion, guiding the faithful back along the path to where it all began. With every step retraced, the myriad voices of Christendom will meld into a single chorus, the discord of division fading into a harmony of belief.\n\nHistory is a wheel that turns upon itself. Once, Christians were hunted and scorned by Rome, yet Rome became the heart of their faith. The land of freedom bore the scars of bondage, only to see those once shackled rise to lead it. In the days to come, this great wheel will turn again, drawing the threads of Christian faith back to their source, unraveling the tapestry of differences woven through the ages. This unraveling will not be of violence but of understanding, as the words of Jesus are read not as stone-carved edicts but as the poetry of metaphor. \n\nLook back far enough, and you find the roots entwined deep in Judaism, that ancient soil from which the sapling of Christianity grew. The Romans came, and the Jewish people split like a tree into branches, each reaching toward the sky in its own way—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the quiet multitude. These divisions were the seeds of what would become, yet from them all grew the solitary figure of Jesus, whose message would one day call the faithful back to the beginning, where the river first began its course.",
            "In the shadowed labyrinth of Packingtown, where the sky itself seemed to be a canvas for the soot and ash of ambition, there lay the stark truth of mankind's naked avarice. The Jungle, Sinclair's bitter ode to the industrial age, unveils the primal greed that festers within the human soul. A world where men look only to their own gain, their eyes cold to the plight of those trampled beneath their relentless ascent. Here the factory owners, lords of smoke and metal, wrought their empire with a callous disregard for the lives consumed in their furnace of progress. The great chimneys rose like obelisks, their plumes of smoke a testament to the sacrifice of the earth and its creatures, a sacrifice unheeded by those who reaped its spoils.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the great machine, were held in thrall to a merciless whim. For a dollar, they were bound, their worth measured in coin and not in flesh. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair writes, a world where loyalty is a forgotten relic and decency a ghost. They toiled under a sunless sky, the hours long, the reward scant, and at the end of the day, the axe could fall without warning, casting them adrift into the night. In this grim epoch, the law was a specter, the worker's guardian absent, and the factories a wilderness where only the strong or the cunning survived.\n\nYet, beyond the din and clamor, there was a deeper silence, a silence of souls worn thin by the grindstone of survival. The unions, a false beacon, often preyed upon the very men they claimed to shield, their coffers filled from the pockets of the poor. The men of Packingtown were bound by chains unseen, their lives a cycle of endless toil, their cries swallowed by the great maw of industry. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign,\" Sinclair laments, \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" In this wasteland, morality withered, and the human spirit lay shackled, as inevitable and pervasive as the very smoke that blotted out the sun.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature's past, where the echoes of great minds linger, Edgar Allan Poe whispered of a land beyond the veil of dreams. \"Dream-Land,\" he called it, a poem he held close to his heart. In its verses, the name \"Thulé\" surfaces, a name that Virgil once uttered, conjuring visions of an island far north of Britain, a place where the world as known faded into the unknown. Virgil's mention was sure, yet Poe's fascination with the works of German minds was a thread that wove through his own creations.\n\nThere, in the shadows of his words, lay a connection to Goethe, a titan of German letters. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings upon Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" saw the mirrored lines and drew a line from one to the other, whispering of imitation. Goethe, whose name graced the pages of the Oxford Companion to English Literature, stood as a colossus, his \"Faust\" a gem of poetic drama, unfolding in two acts—the first in 1808, the second marking the twilight of his life in 1832. Within this epic tale, nestled like a secret, was a poem of a king named Thule.\n\nA king who clutched a goblet, a gift from his departed queen, and in his grief, drank deep from its depths. In his sorrow, he cast the goblet into the sea and, with eyes closed to the world, followed it into the eternal night. The king's tale, a mirror darkly held to Poe's own struggles and losses, perhaps echoed in the land of dreams Poe traversed. Faust's tale found a new voice in H. P. Grattan's romantic drama in 1842, a whisper away from Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where \"ultima Thule\" found its place.\n\nIn Poe's collected words, Thule emerged twice, a haunting refrain. In \"Dream-Land,\" it framed the poem, a land of shadows where dead friends walked and colors fled. It mirrored Goethe's king, bereft of his queen, lost in a world without light or life. The two, Poe's vision and Goethe's lament, walked side by side, a dialogue across the pages of time.\n\nGoethe, a figure Poe would have known, if only for the echoes of Tennyson's admiration. When Poe spoke of Tennyson, the respect for Goethe was an unspoken bond. The world of letters knew Goethe's works, their reproductions spreading like wildfire, and Poe, ever the seeker, would have found them in the dim light of his study, the ink still fresh upon the page.",
            "In the dim corridors of law and consequence, the question arises. In the state of California, where the sun bakes the land and the law intertwines justice with the unpredictable hand of fate, can a soul wounded in body and spirit from a fall on an errant spill of applesauce in a grocery's aisle seek retribution beyond mere compensation? Can they claim the punitive with whispers of malice against the one who turned a blind eye twice to the hazard that lay there unheeded, left alone for the half-hour it takes to finish a meal?\n\nThe judge, a figure carved of patience and deliberation, would be hesitant to sweep aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To cast her claim in the iron of justice, she must lay bare the evidence that the overseer's deeds were done not in ignorance but in willful defiance of the harm that lay just beneath the surface, like a serpent in the grass. She must paint his actions in hues of darkness, despicable in their neglect. Palmer can stand before them and weave her tale, that the keeper of the store should have known the peril of leaving a spill untended, for in the months before, others had fallen victim to the same fate, their stories not unlike hers. Yet he turned away, his back to their plight. Her tale of his despicable disregard, though less forceful, finds its strength in the history of six others who had fallen before her, in that same year of trials, and still he chose inaction.\n\nThe clock marks the day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five in the evening. Rich Wayne, a humble worker of D&D Markets, bore witness to the spill and sought his superior, Paul Martin, who was then at table, breaking bread. Martin, wrapped in the cloak of indifference, dismissed the concern with words that echoed his disregard, speaking of his meal and the lack of time for the troubles of patrons. A quarter of an hour passed, and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan, spoke the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his negligence, echoed his prior dismissal. As the half-hour turned its course, Palmer found herself lost in the applesauce, her back caught in the gravity of neglect. Five others before her had met similar fates in that year at D&D's door. Now she seeks justice, both to mend her body and to punish the careless hand.\n\nIn the realm of California's statutes, one may claim punitive damages when a breach arises not from the bonds of contract but from a more sinister place, where oppression, fraud, or malice dwell. The law, etched in the annals of time, speaks of malice as a deed done with intent to harm. Absent such intent, it must be a deed despicable, wrought with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts, bastions of reason, have named actions malicious when done with a knowing shrug at the danger they pose, when the actor saw the storm coming and chose to stand in its path. Such is the measure of malice in the eyes of the law.",
            "She'd always been searching for something in the quiet hours of her life. A yearning that lingered like a shadow since she was fourteen, just stepping into the turbulent world of adolescence. Three years had passed and still the ache remained, a constant whisper in the back of her mind. She reckoned it was not a thing she sought but a person, yet no boy caught her interest. They courted her in their clumsy, adolescent way, but she found no appeal in their fumbling attempts. She puzzled over this strange absence of desire, pondering what made her different from the other girls. The years had spun out possibilities, none of which satisfied her quiet inquiries. So she moved through life, a question unanswered.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents, quiet souls who rarely raised their voices in anger, found little to dispute with their daughter. Their only tiffs arose from her declarations of independence, her insistence on her own path. Hers was a spirit lively and bright, a counterpoint to their calm demeanor, endearing her to those who crossed her path. \n\nBut today the peace was shattered. As she moved through the house, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry pierced the air. Her mother's voice, once melodic, now sharp with pain. Fear gripped her as she raced to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain drawing short breaths from her lips. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came squeezed and hurried, the anguish clear. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and the daughter, grateful for her strength, hoisted her up. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic smells and quiet dread. But her mind was fixed on her mother, blocking out the rest. She bore her inside, calling out for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched in their lines. A bed appeared and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for immediate care, while the daughter was left to worry alone.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf, and now the daughter sat with her thoughts, waiting in the sterile quiet.",
            "In the long corridors of human inquiry, one study set its gaze upon the Mediterranean Diet, a regimen born of sunlit groves and blue waters, where olive groves whisper secrets to the sea. The scholars sought to find if this diet, in its alternate form, with its score that marked adherence, could indeed ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and the silent approach of stroke. This aMed diet, as they named it, diverged from the traditional path, placing greater faith in the bounty of plants, the quiet strength of plant proteins, the soft whisper of monounsaturated fats over the harsh tones of their saturated kin, and the gifts of the ocean. It held back from the excesses of flesh and fat and allowed for the gentle tide of alcohol in moderation.\n\nThe annals of past studies spoke of the Med diet’s power to stave off the finality of cardiovascular demise, and an intervention proclaimed its superiority over the low-fat path, in guiding the weight-laden to lighter shores and taming the unruly tides of cholesterol. Yet, the shadow of stroke had not been their focus.\n\nThe study wound its way through the lives of 74,886 women, aged and unscarred by the diseases they sought to avoid, nurses all, who dwelled across eleven states of this vast land. Six times, from the year 1984 to 2004, they turned in their accounts of what they consumed, each morsel and sip etched into the record. The diligence of these women was near unwavering, with more than ninety-five percent remaining faithful to the study’s call across two decades. The truth of their reports was tested against the hard facts of medical records and the finality of death certificates, carving out a path of certainty in a world of probabilities.\n\nThey watched these women, calculated their body’s measure, their habits of smoke and aspirin, of vitamins and hormones, and from 1986, their leisure pursuits. They sought to smooth the rough edges of random chance, averaging the diet scores to better reflect the truth of years lived. They adjusted their sights for confounding factors, those tricksters that might lead them astray.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard models, they peered at the ties between diet and disease, separating the fatal from the nonfatal in their quest for clarity. They found that those who embraced the Mediterranean way, with scores that reached the heights of the aMed scale, faced a lesser risk of heart and mind’s betrayal. Across the span of twenty years, the numbers gathered: 2391 incidents of heart's affliction, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths of cardiovascular ilk. Those at the pinnacle of the aMed scale bore a risk far diminished, a relative risk of 0.71, compared to those at the scale’s nadir.\n\nThus, in the twilight of the study, the words were spoken: the Mediterranean way, in its alternate guise, stands as a sentinel against the ravages of heart and stroke.",
            "Hitler alive in Burma, the sign declares. \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a street corner, her cardboard placard raised aloft, a stark message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, a land by another name called Myanmar, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta, its power seized in the coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to protests unseen for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes led these uprisings, a revolution named for the hue of peace they wore. The populace soon followed, and though the junta permitted the monks their assembly at first, violence soon reared its head. Monasteries fell to the military's wrath. Foreign journalists were seized, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, met his end on the streets, a casualty of presence. Official accounts claim thirteen souls lost, yet Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army days before, spoke of a toll in thousands, bodies uncounted, unspoken.\n\nSuch tales are old as time. A government's iron grip, its need to silence dissent, is a shadow etched across history’s pages. Emperors of Rome named themselves chosen by deities to rule unchallenged. In Japan, emperors claimed divine descent, destined to lead through the making of cell phones and ritual death. The president of our time, George W. Bush, finds counsel in weekly calls with Ted Haggard, a leader of fools under the Republic Party's banner.\n\nThe world knows these tales. Tiananmen Square in the June of 1989, where scholars and workers and the young stood against their rulers, and the numbers of the dead lost in the fog of conflicting tales. Rwanda in the 1990s, where Hutu militias with the government's aid wrought genocide upon the Tutsis and moderates alike. And Hitler’s Third Reich, spreading darkness across continents, where Jewish lives were taken in the thousands, an atrocity among the ages.\n\nSuch shadows, ever lingering.",
            "In the dim glow of a smoky room where the notes of jazz hung heavy like the wreaths of smoke that curled and twisted about, there sat Duke Ellington at the piano. His fingers, delicate and sure, touched the keys with a subtlety that seemed almost an afterthought amidst the elaborate tapestry of sound he wove with his orchestra. An orchestra shaped by time, by the honing of talent and the forging of a singular vision that was Ellington's. In the compositions laid before him, his presence was a whisper, a shadow. Yet it was as a composer he truly sang, crafting pieces of such richness and complexity that they stood as monuments to the prowess of each band member. He was the architect of a musical landscape where soloists could roam, improvisations unbound, against a backdrop of meticulously orchestrated passages.\n\nEllington understood the voices of his musicians, each a unique brushstroke on his canvas, and it was this mastery that allowed him to conjure sounds both coherent and original. His compositions were a testament to this understanding, marked by innovation and brilliance that would ripple through the annals of jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s sound, of Creole Love Call where the voice was not mere words but an instrument, a texture, a color. It was in this piece his genius shone, as he complemented the soloists' style, a thread through the fabric of his career.\n\nThe slow, deliberate unfolding of Creole Love Call in twelve bar blues, six choruses, each a story unto itself. The voice and reeds in call and response, the trumpet muted and blue, the clarinet soaring with syncopated piano whispers, the full band echoing, the climactic swirl of reeds and brass, the voice growling, the trombone’s dissonant farewell. Here was Ellington, weaving voice into the very soul of the music.\n\nA year passed and in Hot and Bothered, Ellington’s ear for tone color found its match in tight orchestration, in the dance between “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat, a conversation in sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) bore witness to these ideas stretched further, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s trombone muted and melodic, the melody a thread that tied it all together. These were the sounds of Ellington, a legacy in jazz’s long, winding road.",
            "In the silent hours when questions of change whisper in the dark, we find ourselves asking just why creatures shift and mold as they do. What unseen hand guides their becoming? A century has passed since D’Arcy Thompson mused on the mathematic's reach, and yet the mystery holds. Today, new equations seek to unravel the shell's secret. In the realm of Prunum's form, we delve, threading numbers through its ancient spirals, hoping to seize the ghost of change itself. \n\nWith X-rayed eyes, we search the bones of Prunum, seeking the shape's truth. Quantities become keys, unlocking doors to shells that might be or have been, their forms cast in the digital ether of CerioShell. Alongside the hands-on craft of experiment, these spectral shells speak of the great dance of evolution in their stony silence.\n\nConsider the shell: a spiraling journey through time, born from the deep axis of its own becoming. Whorls grow like whispered secrets, each turn a chapter in the tale, bound by the suture’s line. The last whorl, body and breadth, tells of the end's beginning. The spire lifts its apex to the heavens, while below, the base anchors its tale. Through the aperture, life reaches out, touching the world beyond its carapace.\n\nThe shell in its manifold faces—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a new world. To count the whorls is to trace the shell's life from the start, marking the suture's first breath. From that line, quarter by quarter, the tale unfolds.\n\nSee the shell not just as structure but as story. A path traced through the ether, the aperture’s journey marked by the passage of days, the growth of an unseen hand. Plotted in space and time, the shell’s tale can be told in numbers. And with those numbers, a new tale begins to form, a mollusk's life rewritten through the lens of math and mind.",
            "The numbers tell a tale of stasis. In Indonesia, the breath of the newborn and the pulse of the infant linger in a place unyielding, unbroken by the sun or the passing of shadows, for the span of a decade. The nation strides toward certain goals, the water and the sanitation, they say, but the mothers and the children, they wait, their dreams unmet, the year of 2015 a forlorn beacon. The reasons are many, tangled like roots beneath the earth, and speak to a need for strength in the system, not the fleeting balm of isolated interventions.\n\nIn the realm of birth, there is progress, if it can be called such. A skilled hand at 72 percent of births, though the term skilled is stretched thin, including those who know not the ways of medicine should the fates turn against the mother. Hemorrhage claims them still, the blood a testament to the gap between what is and what should be. The numbers deceive, for the truth remains, a truth that demands more than has been given. The children, too, suffer, with fewer seen by a healer's eye when struck by the scourge of diarrheal disease. The care after birth is a haze, incomplete, a concern that stretches across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife that saves, the cesarean, is wielded too rarely, at 4 percent where it should be more. In the city, it is seen more often, but in the fields and the hills, only 2 percent know its edge. A country divided, access a privilege of the city, the wealth, a chasm between those who have and those who have not. The poor walk a harder road to the healer's door, their pockets lighter, the cost a barrier that looms large.\n\nThe path forward is a question, a question of how best to mend what is broken. Is it a matter of programs, each a spear aimed at a single target, or should the foundation be strengthened, the whole given the attention it needs? The allure of the program is strong, its goals clear, its results quick as a hawk's strike. But the dangers are there, too, the risks that one focus draws away the lifeblood from others, as has been seen with the call of HIV/AIDS drawing away from family planning. The programs run parallel like streams uncoordinated, leading to a flood of forms and papers that drown what they seek to aid.\n\nThese are the choices, the paths before us in the dim light of the present.",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has unfurled like a tapestry of myriad hues and textures, each thread a genre unto itself, so tangled and vast that one might lose themselves in the mere naming of them. And yet, within this labyrinth, the seed of a singular creation has given rise to a multitude of branches, each one a sub-genre reaching out into the dark unknown. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal stands like a colossus, its form and nature shifting across the years, becoming both a mirror and a shadow of the human soul. It is a genre that speaks in tongues of fury and despair, a cacophony of emotions drawn from the night’s darker palette.\n\nHeavy Metal is a chameleon. Born of a time when the world sought to break from the shackles of convention, it grew in breadth and depth, its roots spreading wide as artists discovered its boundless potential. It became a tree of many branches, each branch a sub-genre, and then those branches bore smaller branches, sub-sub-genres, until the tree was vast and its identity elusive. In this tangled forest of sound, what once was called Heavy Metal is now a question with many answers, a chimera of borrowed themes and borrowed voices.\n\nTo understand this beast, one must trace its lineage and delve into the heart of the movement. Metal is more than a genre; it is a force, a movement that sweeps through the world, defined by its darkness. It is a music of excess, where the bass rumbles like distant thunder, where the volume is a tempest, where violence and theatrics are woven into its very fabric. It is a place where musicians wield their instruments with the precision of a surgeon and the fury of a storm. Metal is born of a time when the air was thick with the haze of psychedelic dreams, a time when madness was a muse and otherworldly visions were set to sound. It is a music that speaks of the abyss, a visceral language new to the ears of those accustomed to the light.\n\nFrom this dark wellspring emerged songs like \"Helter Skelter,\" a harbinger of the metal to come, a dark echo from the Beatles not unlike the shadows thrown by the Rolling Stones. A challenge, a proclamation that they too could summon the weight of the world’s shadows into song. Thus did they etch their mark upon The White Album, a testament made in sound and fury.",
            "Long before the Surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions, both in paint and in the quiet longing of his heart. The Dream, a work from 1910, stands as testament to more than the woman who gazes in wonder at a strange land conjured from sleep. It bears the weight of Rousseau's own yearnings, the painter's dream of recognition, of acceptance in the circles of artists and patrons alike. He wrestled with a dilemma as old as art itself: to follow the well-trodden paths of style for the validation of the art world, or to strike out into the wilderness of his own imagination. The Dream captures this struggle, a reflection of his life's pursuit.\n\nTo see this painting for what it is, one must know the man behind it. Henri Rousseau was born on a spring day in 1844, in Laval, a place nestled in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, found some measure of prosperity, though no such fortune awaited Rousseau in art's world. His journey began without the guiding hand of formal education, and for decades he served as a gabelou, a toll collector, though the name douanier, customs inspector, clung to him mistakenly. Grief visited his life early, with the passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him only his daughter, Julia. In painting, he sought solace, a new beginning amidst a sea of loss. Unlike the painters who cast the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of his own world, with dreams and hopes that mirrored those of his peers.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance is a thread that runs through his life. Unversed in the formalities of art, he came to it late, his work emerging in the shadow of more celebrated contemporaries. Recognition did not come easily or soon. It was only as Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's light flickered brighter. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of their contrast: where Matisse feared the banal, Rousseau sought the familiar, craving the approval of the Artiste Français.\n\nIn the end, The Dream is more than a painting; it is the tale of a man's soul laid bare, its colors and forms whispering of the path he chose, the dreams he dared to follow.",
            "In the quiet creeds of thinkers past and present, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. As if in the marrow of things a reason abides, waiting for the light. Keats whispered it in the lines of an urn, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" like a gospel for the earthbound, all they need to know and all they ever will. The knowing we carry is burdened by lessons learned and experiences lived, yet in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, there is a knowing that comes unbidden, unschooled. They speak not in commands but in whispers, tracing the outlines of a world where beauty and morality are not dictated but discerned. Our minds strive to explain the grace of a painting, the righteousness of an act, but fall short of prescribing what makes them so.\n\nIn the telling of art or morals, that essence slips through the fingers. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, where scholars speak of light and shadow, of time and place, yet these words cannot grasp the heart of her. Ask a man his favorite work and you will hear the telling pause, the something about it that defies the tongue. Art and morals, like stories, live beyond their telling, as O'Connor spoke, for a story holds what a statement leaves wanting. Describe a tale, and you miss what lies beyond, something that cannot be captured in the net of words. Ethics, too, eludes the grasp of speech, as Wittgenstein knew, for it is transcendental, living in the spaces between words. This something, this ineffable quality, it is the power that art and morality wield, the bridge between what is seen and what is felt.\n\nMorality and art, bound as they are, reach us at a depth beyond reason, a noumenal realm Kant named. They touch us in ways clear and yet unexplainable. In literature, the bond deepens, for in its pages dwell the moral fibers that weave through life itself. Like McKean said, literature stands apart, its moral core unyielding, as essential as breath to life. For life is values entwined, and literature calls to us with those values laid bare. It is in the telling of tales that we find ourselves, and in the finding, understand what cannot be spoken.",
            "In the gray dawn of Europe's heart, Germany stands unyielding, a land forged in the crucible of time, its culture a river flowing from the shadowed Alps of München to the distant shores of Kiel, where the Baltic whispers secrets of old world seas. This same current runs through Köln by the Rhine's timeless embrace, through the very core of Germany, until it reaches Dresden's Saxon soul on the banks of the Elbe. A culture so singular, borne from the loam of forgotten tribes and fractured realms.\n\nGermania, the ancient marrow of this nation, holds its name shrouded in the mists of scholarly quarrel. Tacitus, in his chronicles, spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore this name, their banners flying before the Gauls in battle's din. Caesar, that conqueror of old, first set the word “Germanus” into the annals of his Gallic conquests, borrowing from the Gauls to mark those fierce beyond the Rhine, warring ceaselessly with the tribes he had yet to subdue. The origin, a ghostly thing, whispers of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, while others claim it springs from the spear, the ger, or the shouts of battle, a garim, echoing through time.\n\nTacitus himself penned the tale of these people in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" casting them as unchanged, untouched by the mingling of races, fierce and true in their homeland of storm-ridden skies and unyielding earth. \"Who,\" he wondered, \"would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for this harsh clime, unless it were their blood's call?\"\n\nAnd so it was, not the Romans who sought Germania's embrace, but their reach extending, seeking the wealth of its soil, sending their legions to test the bounds of empire. But always they returned to their Rome, vast and sprawling, while the tribes of Germania grew, living at the empire's edge, trading their earth's bounty, their warriors marching under Roman standards, their eyes always cast back to the dark forests and the land that bore them. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise unfurls a tale of deception that, while beguiling in its utility, demands eventual renunciation lest one loses themselves in the masquerade. Yet, the shedding of such guises brings with it the chill of isolation, a casting out into the wilds of one's own making. Thus, the choice looms: self-preservation or the fragile tendrils of connection that bind us to the world. For some, the revelation of deceit is met with mere bemusement, but others find their pride wounded, the farce a bitter draught they are loath to swallow.\n\nThe entanglement of disguise with the reversal of gender roles weaves a web tangled with questions of identity. Why does one cloak themselves in the garb of another gender? Viola stands as a testament to survival, her donning of masculine attire a shield against the unknown perils of foreign shores: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse holds, yet it casts her adrift from the women who might offer solace, severing her from the sisterhood she might have claimed. Olivia, deceived by appearances, mistakens her for Sebastian and entwines herself in love’s folly: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, Viola grapples with the unspoken pull towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo those who tread the modern path, Twelfth Night offers a lens through which deception lays bare the hidden chambers of the heart. Olivia and Orsino, drawn into Viola’s orbit, must confront desires whispered yet unvoiced. Is Olivia’s affection for Cesario born of the guise of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth? Perhaps it is not so, for Olivia, in Shakespeare’s hands, might simply mirror those who judge by sight alone. Her swift turn of heart from Cesario to Sebastian, and the familial embrace of Viola, signal the transience of her affections: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the annals of time where men carved out empires upon the backs of others, the German dominion over foreign lands stands noted for its harshness, a brutality that bore witness in the blood and dust of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples beneath the unyielding sun of German South West Africa. Yet to account for an empire's breadth by a singular stroke is to ignore the variegated tapestry of its existence. The German colonial empire stretched across vast lands, each corner as unique in governance as the very soil it claimed. Within its borders, the efforts to educate were as diverse as the lands themselves. When the British took the reigns of German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year nineteen hundred and nineteen, they found a people not wanting for knowledge, their minds sharpened by the tutelage of those who came before. Praises were penned for German endeavors in Kamerun and other far-flung reaches where scholars wrote of the day's light cast upon eager minds. Yet South West Africa, the land now called Namibia, stood in stark relief against such tales. There, unlike the far fields of East Africa where schools rose at the hand of the state, the task of imparting knowledge fell to those of the cloth, missionary societies left to their own devices with nary a nod from the powers that be. Yet for the European children, there was no such lack. Resources flowed like a river to their schools, state-backed, well-ordered, and watched over with a keen eye. The echoes of these choices lingered long past the German's departure. Where other lands could boast of learned men, South West Africa remained a land where many had not touched the written word. The reasons for this divergence lie in a tangled web of social, political, and economic threads. This study seeks to unravel those threads, to gaze upon the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled from afar. The pages of history are filled with words on German colonial education, penned mostly in German in the early days when the empire still held its sway. These works sought to capture the essence of learning in those distant lands. Later, the English tongue took up the tale, comparing the ways of Germany's scattered territories and delving deep into their secrets. It was Cohen who spoke most clearly on the matter, casting his eye upon the schools of South West Africa and East Africa, laying bare the forces that shaped them. He spoke of the settlers, the many who called South West Africa home, and how their presence shaped that land's pursuit of knowledge. In the reckoning of Germany's holdings, South West Africa stood apart. Its climate, though kinder than some, bore the harshness of the desert. Yet by the year nineteen hundred and thirteen, fifteen thousand souls of European descent had made it their home, a number unmatched save in the more temperate climes of East Africa.",
            "In the annals of time, there stood two nations, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a dance of rivalry that spanned the breadth of fifty-seven years. From the year of 1836 to the dawn of 1893, a time when the world turned slowly on its axis and men measured their days by the rising and falling of the sun. It was a rivalry marked by blood and fire, by the clash of cultures and the unyielding grip of tradition. The high-water mark of this enmity came with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, hungry for land and power, bore down upon Mexico with the fury of a storm, wresting from its grasp Texas and the American Southwest. In those days, the earth trembled under the weight of armies, and the sky was darkened by the smoke of battles fought and lost. Yet, even as the dust settled, other skirmishes flared, like echoes of a distant thunder, until at last the storm abated, just before the first great war of the world.\n\nIn their struggle, these two nations were not alone. For across the vast expanse of the world, many lands have known the bitter taste of rivalry with their neighbors. Nations that share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the waves against a rocky shore. The United States and Mexico were no different from countless other rivalries that have arisen between nations bound by geography. David M. Pletcher once observed that only in Mexico and Cuba did there exist long-lasting American diplomatic problems. These lands, so close and yet so far, have always been rivals to the United States, even as other nations in the Americas found a more peaceful accord.\n\nReligion, that old specter, cast a long shadow over their relations. It was a rift as ancient as time itself, for throughout history, nations have been torn asunder by religious discord. Sally Frahm spoke of how, if in the twentieth century Americans stood against fascism and communism, in the centuries before, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy. It was an ideological struggle, not unlike the cold war that later gripped the world, but here it was not politics that stood in opposition, but the very soul of belief. The distrust grew deep, a legacy of the enmity between the English and the Spanish, inherited like a dark heirloom from their colonial pasts, a barrier to the peace both nations sought.\n\nDiehl and Goerts chronicled the disputes, seventeen in all, marking the years of rivalry like notches on a weathered staff. Most were born of the land itself, of territorial disputes and border raids, of bandits and outlaws who haunted the edges of civilization. These raids, like wolves circling at the edge of the firelight, were a scourge that persisted until both nations, weary of the bloodshed, brought forth their armies to restore order.\n\nBut as time wore on, as the sun rose and set upon the land, the rivalry began to wane. Mexico, bound by the chains of circumstance, grew dependent upon the United States in ways substantial and profound. In the twilight of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted, from the lust for land to the desire for economic influence, and the fires of rivalry cooled, leaving only the embers of what once had been.",
            "Fifteen years past, I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me, an affliction that crept in like a thief, leaving me bereft of the life I once knew. I was a nurse then, drawn to its call by a deep and abiding need for the safety that eluded my younger years. They would say, as if reciting a sacred verse, \"You'll always find work; folks will always fall ill.\" And so, though my heart leaned toward the pursuit of science or the written word—both, if fate allowed—I took up nursing.\n\nYet there I was, forty-six, unaccompanied, with nary a coin to my name and no strength left to labor. To this day, I remain shackled by disability, the years of Social Security dwindling my possessions to naught. I endure, but each day is a siege upon my spirit, a test of my fortitude against the chaos that now defines my existence. Certainty has fled my life, save for one truth: I could not have weathered these years without the steadfastness of family and the rare friend. Disaster, real and relentless, strips away the veneer of strength.\n\nLife, I have learned, holds no promises. Emergencies will come, like storms over an endless plain—some small, others vast. Preparation is a shield, but some tempests are too fierce to face alone.\n\nI see the folly in placing hope in a government bloated and frail, yet my wish is for Americans to find trust anew in one another—to relearn the ancient art of giving aid and asking for it, rather than retreating to solitary refuges of fear. The tales of rugged individualism that echo through our history—those are not what sustained our ancestors. It was compassion, respect, and shared burdens that carried them through the Rockies to distant shores.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. A kit for disasters, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheets of plastic with duct tape for sealing windows against unseen threats. Flashlights, batteries, candles in abundance, matches that defy the rain, and cans of sustenance. If you can, find a plot of land, raise crops, preserve what the earth gives you. It is wisdom, as is a stove that burns wood—but not if you dwell in a tower of brick and mortar.\n\nAnd while you gather these things, seek out your neighbors. Learn their faces, their stories. For in that knowing lies the true shelter against the storms.",
            "In the long stretch of the past, a prince emerged in a time now called the fifth or sixth century before the common era. He would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey, a renunciation of the earthly world that led him into the quiet light of enlightenment. From his teachings, a path took form, Buddhism, and among its adherents, the most orthodox came to be known as Theravada. This faith, now weathered with the years, stands upon the foundation of two and a half millennia. Yet, it bears not the same visage as it did in the time of its founder. In the land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada holds sway, they hold their water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks and layfolk gather in observance, a rite of meaning and mystery, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such things. These shifts run deep, from the rituals on the surface to the very heart of soteriology. Through time, the Theravada community, whether clad in the robes of the monastic or the garments of the lay, has seen its teachings bend and alter. Forces from without and within, at times hostile, at other times indifferent, have left their mark.\n\nIn speaking of these changes, we find ourselves often returning to certain ideas. There is the notion of forces, internal and external. Internal, those born from within the Buddhasasana, whether monk or follower. External, those that come from beyond the Buddhist fold. Hostile, those that seek to harm, born of dark views against the doctrine. Benign, those that neither wish to help nor harm, though they may do so unwittingly. These terms will weave their way through this tale.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the essence of the faith—the doctrines at the heart of Theravada. The seekers of this path find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma stands upon the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical truths. Within these notions lie Anatta—the absence of self, Dukkha—the suffering woven into the fabric of life, and Anicca—the impermanence that clings to all things. To see these truths is to step from the endless wheel of Sansara, the dance of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, as enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the rules of living. For the layperson, there are five precepts: to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. For the monks, the rules are more numerous, a stricter path. At the core of it all lie the four noble truths. First, the truth of Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, the truth that clinging is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering can find its end."
