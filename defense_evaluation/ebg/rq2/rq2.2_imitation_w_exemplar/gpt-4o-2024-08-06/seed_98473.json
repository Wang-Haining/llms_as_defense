            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed precincts of any bargaining table, culture looms large, a specter both known and unknown, defined as much by absence as by presence. It is no monolith nor singularity, but a tapestry woven with contradictions and myriad hues. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to grasp at straws, to paint with such broad strokes that the canvas remains blank. A negotiator's true task lies in discerning the heart of the matter, the pulse of the culture that sits across from him, its rhythms and its truths, and how these will dance in the conversation between them. As one steps into the realm of another culture, it is seen through the prism of one's own, and inevitably, mirrors are held up to each other.\n\nTo fathom the depths of a foreign mind is to wander through its past, to acknowledge its biases without censure or change, to meet it where it stands, especially when one's own footing is less sure. When the ground beneath is unfamiliar, respect for the sacred rites and beliefs of others becomes an ally, bridging the chasm of misunderstanding and pushing the discourse forward.\n\nYet culture is not confined to the boundaries of nations. Within the borders of a single land, companies cultivate their own ethos. Some value the grinding tick of the office clock, others the gentle flow of time unbound. Such cultures reveal themselves in the garb of their people, in words spoken plainly or cloaked, in the division of tasks and the paths to upward mobility. Philanthropy may be encouraged at every level or funneled solely through sanctioned channels. Look to America and see the mosaic of corporate cultures, each distinct, even as they share the same soil. A harmony of exteriors may belie deeper intricacies, calling for a more profound exploration.\n\nValues, the bedrock of culture, whisper the reasons behind actions. Where honor and collective peace are cherished, a negotiator will not sully another's name to gain an edge. In cultures where a hard bargain holds sway, the rush to settle may not be felt. These truths must be understood long before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, to truly negotiate, to find common ground, one must look beyond the general to the individual, to see the person behind the culture.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So it is written in the Psalms, the ancient words echoing through the halls of time. Anselm took these words to heart, weaving them into the tapestry of his argument for the existence of the Almighty. In this reflection of the divine, Aquinas too found his voice, their twin songs rising in defense of a singular truth. But to weigh the merit of their claims, one must first assume the existence of this God they both champion, for their arguments are bound to a vision of the divine that brooks no rival. \n\nAnselm's path is one of inward turning, seeking the divine spark within. His argument is a journey of the soul, a reaching for understanding through the lens of faith. He speaks of God as a presence in the mind, a truth that cannot be unthought. The proof, he says, is within, in the silent spaces of the heart where God already dwells. It is a knowing, an acceptance of that which defies the grasp of reason, a trust in unseen certainties. This faith, they say, is the evidence of things not seen.\n\nAquinas walks a different road. His is the path of reason, of logic and the empirical. He offers five arguments, each a stone on the path to God: change and causation, contingency and degrees of excellence, and finally, the harmony of the world. In these, he finds necessity, a puzzle whose missing piece is God. He would have us believe through reason alone, a logic that needs no leap of faith. To see the world is to see the hand that crafts it. \n\nAnd so they stand, Anselm and Aquinas, each with their proofs, each with their truths. Yet neither holds the whole, for the divine is a mystery beyond the grasp of mortal minds. What they offer are glimpses, shadows on the wall of the cave. The heart knows what the mind cannot hold, and in that knowing, there is God.",
            "The way of words is a curious thing, how they lay upon the page like shadows cast by some unseen light. Authors weave them with intent, hoping to stir in the hearts of readers a certain notion or sentiment. Some weave better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he knew well the art of this weaving in his tale of The Great Gatsby. He took to pairing words that would not naturally find themselves together, shaping an atmosphere around his characters and their world. And then there were the colors, symbols imbued with meaning, each a thread in the tapestry he wove. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink. In Gatsby, Fitzgerald gave these colors life, a breath of significance that lingered long after the page was turned.\n\nWhite and gray, they spoke of sameness, of things worn and faded, white a little more refined, gray a little more weary. Fitzgerald set these colors to work from the start, painting his world in their hues. Daisy and Jordan, perpetually draped in white—like specters of privilege. All around, white was the color of choice: Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gaudy gala, Tom in his white shirt when he sought out Myrtle, even Catherine powdered in a milky white. The absence of white, the splash of primary colors at Gatsby's party, was a jarring thing. Common things were painted white or gray: the white chasms of New York, the gray names of Gatsby's revelers, Catherine’s apartment a slice of white cake in a city of sameness. Plain folk and places were painted thus: Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray stretch of cars and land in the valley of ashes, the Italian child a shade of gray, the dog-seller an old gray man.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald had laid out these colors, he used them to mark the mundane, the unremarkable. Daisy, in her white dress and her little white roadster, became less a person and more a thing, a piece of Gatsby's longing, an object of desire. Time and again, Daisy is shrouded in white, her presence diminished to a mere uniformity—her fur collar a gray haze, her dress white as Tom and Gatsby clash over her. Fitzgerald, in his way, used colors to strip away the layers of his characters until the truth lay bare.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the earth gives itself over to growth, the land spreads out beneath the mild sky, a cradle of bounty. This place where tomatoes and citrus take root, where leafy greens unfurl and the peppers hang like jewels upon the vine. Here, the land is a testament to what the sun and soil can conjure. Peaches and lemons, berries, and honey, all drawn from the earth's grasp. There is a hunger for what grows without the taint of man’s artifice, a market for the organic fruits of the earth, and in San Diego, it is a desire not easily sated. Here, the eggs and the milk bear the mark of nature's hand, and the farms open their gates, inviting the curious to walk the paths between the rows. The landowner finds in these endeavors a chance to align with programs that promise both sustenance and sanctuary, to marry profit with preservation.\n\nYet, the road of organic farming is not without its trials. The absence of chemicals demands a greater toil, a vigilance against the encroachment of pests and weeds. The soil must be nourished from the hands of those who tend it, forgoing the ease of modern alchemy. Such labor is a costly endeavor, and the small farms lack the vastness of their industrial kin. To maintain the wild among the cultivated, to plant cover crops, to guide the grazing herd, to root out the invasive, these too demand a toll. The landowner, in seeking to blend the wild with the till, may look to those with knowledge or means to ease the burden while enriching the land.\n\nThe chosen ground lies near Potrero, a tract of chaparral and oak, of grassland that whispers in the wind beside the Cleveland National Forest. Here, in the ecoregion of the Southern Foothills, a plan takes shape, a conservation of the many species whose fates hang in balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the gnatcatcher, all woven into the fabric of this place, some clinging to the edge of memory.\n\nLong before, this land bore the footprints of those who knew it first, the Native Americans, and then those who came with cattle and saws in the age of iron and steam. A homestead it was, where beasts grazed and timber fell to the ax. I took this parcel from the lists of property, seeking what the land might offer to those who wish to farm and to preserve. To find what the earth might give and what might be given back, I looked to the nearby farm that thrives on the same soil.",
            "There is a tether between brothers, a cord that binds and holds, unyielding and eternal. Within this tether lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than any soul who stands outside their shared blood, and they see themselves mirrored in each other's eyes. It is when the world presses hardest upon them that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, be it for good or ill. When these emotions rise to the surface, they come at a cost. To grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the consequences they bring. When one meets a brother's gaze and sees within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as the world sees them but as they truly are. It is in their deeds and the consequences of those deeds that their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, and with them walk the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Across a lush, vividly described landscape, they embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in a scene of finality, and only one brother emerges from its shadow. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the swirling complexities within the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.  \nThe protagonist's deeds are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he first steps out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated venture, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother to teach worldly skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high fork of the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams were shattered, for Doodle was born with a heart frail as tissue, making his survival unlikely. Even if he lived, the prospect of vigorous physical feats was a distant dream. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, his head brimming with wild fantasies, to have them dashed in a heartbeat. Indeed, he even bears a dark anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating smothering him with a pillow. What child considers such a dire act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him. Such a simple gesture fills the protagonist with hope, revealing that his conviction was weak. Deep within, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the vast wilderness of the mind where shadows flicker and the unknown looms, the human brain stands as a labyrinthine creation, a masterwork of complexity and invention. From the dawn of time to the age of steel and circuits, the images we draw to make sense of it have shifted, from waxen slabs to parchment, from the written word to the cold logic of machines. Yet, as you wander these cerebral paths, beware the mirage of these metaphors, for they can mislead and obscure the truth.\n\nThe journey of understanding begins with the senses, those ancient messengers that transmute the raw elements of the world—touch, warmth, the tremble of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind. A symphony of signals, shaped and reshaped by the brain's arcane algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processes. Consider the simplicity of a black box on a field of white; the bottom-up gaze discerns the lines and hues, the edges where shadow meets light, whispering to you of its form. Meanwhile, the top-down mind, wise with the knowledge of what has come before, hastens recognition, turning mere perception into understanding—a black box, not a void in the white expanse.\n\nYet, amid this torrent of perception, there stands the sentinel of attention, a guardian that chooses which whispers of thought are worthy of the mind's gaze. You look down and see not each blade of grass beneath your feet, though they are there, silently processed. But in the clamor of voices, your name, like a bright flame, calls to you above the din. Through layers of thought, this guardian of focus shapes what is seen and known.\n\nTo hold the world's knowledge within the mind, it must first be caught and kept. Memory, with its many faces—fleeting, like the sensory; momentary, like the working; enduring, like the long-term—begins with the act of encoding. Each sensation is captured in its own fashion; the spoken word is a tapestry of form and sound and meaning. Once captured, it must be held. In the fleeting moments of working memory, the spark of thought loops through its neural path, a brief echo of electricity. In the depths of long-term memory, it is woven into the very fabric of proteins, a tapestry of existence.\n\nIn the endeavor to map this realm, many models arise, each a reflection of humanity's quest for understanding. Some draw from the echoes of recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the pulse of the living brain. The semantic network, a web of concepts and connections, tells of \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" and from \"table,\" the leap to \"wooden,\" a lattice of thought across the vastness of the mind.",
            "In the year two thousand and seven, the United States found itself swallowed by a financial abyss, the likes of which it had not seen in many years. Unemployment rose like a specter, the housing market collapsed under its own weight, and the mighty pillars of American industry lay shattered. This recession grips the nation even now, demanding we ask how such ruin came to pass and how it might be averted. At the heart of it all lay the self-serving and short-sighted machinations of those in power, who pressed upon banks and firms the issuance of sub-prime loans within a frail financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pressed to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into complex instruments. When the borrowers faltered, the banks lacked the reserves to withstand the storm, and the chaos spread like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the waning days of the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure his legacy with a second term. In a bid to bolster his standing, the administration loosened lending constraints, laying bare the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfold years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the gathering storm in 1999, noting the mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to extend mortgage loans to those of modest means, even as stockholders demanded ever-greater profits. Holmes predicted the outcome of such folly: that in lean times, these government-backed entities might find themselves in dire straits, much like the savings and loan crisis of the eighties. As foretold, reckless lending led inexorably to economic calamity.\n\nThe unraveling was hastened by the tangled web of new mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations drew more sectors of the economy into the housing market's orbit. Families and financial markets alike found themselves overextended, precariously poised on the housing bubble's fragile skin.\n\nAnd burst it did, with devastating consequence. Financial titans that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves ensnared. The top investment banks recorded staggering debts, their combined mortgage obligations reaching four point one trillion dollars, a full thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers dismembered, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley forced into the embrace of commercial banking, subject to stringent oversight. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with five trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the government's aegis in September of 2008.",
            "In the quiet of a room where the light falls faint and the air is thick with the thoughts of a writer, there lies the temptation of exposition. A place where the words take form and the stories unfold, yet it is a double-edged sword. For some, it is a flight of prose, magical and captivating; for others, it is the lull that sends a reader adrift, their fingers hovering over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name. Dr. Merlin knows this too well, her voice rising in protest when the weight of too much information bears down, strangling the narrative.\n\nThe truth is, exposition is a fickle companion.\n\nReaders, wise and seasoned, know the adage: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, the lure of lengthy passages pulls even the best into its grip, where stories derail or drown in abundance. Exposition whispers in a writer's ear, urging them to lay bare the history, to rush through the mundane, to reach the heart of the tale. It is not unlike the fiend upon the shoulder, coaxing the author to divulge every trivial detail of each character's past.\n\nBut exposition is the telling of tales, the recounting of events in words that are too plain. In film, it is the monologue, the character laying out the tale like an ancient mariner's lament. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who speaks.\n\nSuppose you read of a heroine who met her beloved at a certain time, in a certain place; they were wed in grandeur, and her husband's life was snuffed out before her eyes. Would you expect this tale to be spun in a mere two pages, their voices scarcely heard? Surely not. An author must delve into the husband's soul, his words and deeds a testament to his love, while the heroine, in her own way, reflects the change and richness he brought to her life. When she mourns, you mourn with her; her grief becomes yours, drawing you closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, the tale demands more than the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nWriters must breathe life into the narrative, even when the urge to gloss over details beckons. Perhaps there is a new character, a man whose past is a tapestry of Air Force days, a gas station night manager's life, two marriages left behind, childless, with dreams of owning the station and a penchant for fishing. Once, he had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "The dawn broke over Columbus, Ohio, and the first murmurings of the day came through the flickering screen, the news of the world carried forth by NBC 4. There was a man, his name Shad Hostettler, from Ashley, Ohio, who had turned the blade upon his own. His wife's name left unsaid, as if her silence was her own testament. They showed his likeness, a visage of malice, the eyes of a man who knew too well the darkness within. The tale was brief, a scant two minutes of time, a story still unfolding, yet it was enough. Enough for the world to know of the evil that walked among them.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen years, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods, the morning's shadow upon him. No names save his own, no arrests, no suspects in the wind. The SWAT team prowling the scene like hounds in the night, their search fruitless as yet. The tale told quick and gone, the brevity of it a whisper of the world’s indifference, for he was a black man in a black neighborhood. A truth as old as time, that the world turns slower for those of darkness, a truth that cuts deeper than any blade.\n\nThere was a gunshot, a bullet that found its mark in the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber reminder of the world’s capriciousness. They spoke of where it might have happened, Crime-Stoppers offering riches for the name of the one who pulled the trigger. Five thousand pieces of silver for justice.\n\nThe skies were to weep come afternoon, the storms a promise of the day, the temperatures to cling to the low eighties, a respite of sorts. The weatherman’s voice a siren’s call to keep watching, to stay tuned for the storm to break.\n\nAnd then a robbery on Clime Road, a man cloaked in darkness, a hoodie drawn against the world. They spoke of him, his skin dark as the night, his height and weight a litany of his form, the words lingering longer than they ought, as if his color was the crime itself.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name spoken with disdain, a drug kingpin from Texas, his empire of marijuana stretching to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, 300 months, the years wrapped in numbers that seemed to stretch further than the truth. Hispanic, they said, a man marked by his heritage, though it mattered not. The world cares little for such things when it casts its judgment.\n\nAnd so the stories were told, the tales of the day laid bare, the world turning still, indifferent to the lives it held in its grasp.",
            "In the realm of financial instruments, the ETF stands like a lone sentinel upon the plains. An exchange traded fund, it is, crafted to mirror the ebb and flow of an index, a commodity, or perhaps a basket of assets akin to an index fund, yet possessed of a singular flexibility, for it moves upon the exchange as a stock might. The ETF offers the broad sweep of diversification found in an index, yet retains the singular charm of stock ownership, granting the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold in one's hand as few as a single share. Though these attributes glisten with the allure of promise, their expense ratios remain modest, far beneath the weight of the common mutual fund. Yet, not all is without cost, for a commission is the toll exacted upon any trade, as if one were dealing in the stocks of old. \n\nThe breadth of ETFs is wide, a tapestry of funds unfurled across the market. And in this, the savvy traveler in the world of finance must ever question, must ever seek if the proclaimed benefits, such as diversification, stand true in the harsh light of scrutiny, and to what extent they hold. Our endeavor here is to examine the ETF known as IHF, to lay it against those top ten holdings that form its backbone, to weigh if the single ETF stands in the light cast by a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks, and if there be configurations yet untried that might yield an optimal balance, a sharper return.\n\nIn this undertaking, the burden of examining each holding in its entirety would be a cumbersome beast indeed. Thus, we consider only the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below lie the top 10 holdings, each a piece of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these ten stocks serve as the face of the ETF IHF, we may turn to the current % of assets, brought to a unity of 100%, and from this, derive the contributions of each stock to the Beta and Return of a portfolio composed solely of these ten, each in the measure the ETF has ordained through its holdings. The calculus of Beta and return is laid bare in the chart below.\n\nFrom the figures, one sees clearly that a portfolio with but the top ten holdings boasts a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in returns. It is also clear that the Beta of these ten is .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. The findings thus suggest that a portfolio trimmed to these ten holdings might yield a greater return with diminished Beta. Yet, there remains the whisper of doubt, the question if the means of these two portfolios stand apart, truly distinct from one another.\n\nTo probe this matter, to discern if these portfolios are as different as they seem, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock among the top ten, each brought to the same measure of 100%, to compare their collective standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the cold breath of winter, the numbers fell away like leaves from a dying tree. A campus in New England, the air biting and cruel, saw the logs of commuters dwindle in the third month, a sharp decline that seemed to echo the silent halls and empty paths where once footsteps trod. December, the month where the world turns inward, brought with it final flurries of schoolwork, grades, and the weight of a year closing. The days slipped away, and with them the memory of the commuter log, lost amidst the rush and the hush of the holiday's onset. A break, a pause in the cycle, where the students and faculty vanished into the month-long void, leaving the campus hushed in their absence. \n\nThe spring would come, as it always does, late in January, when the world begins to thaw and life resumes its relentless march. Yet, February lay like a shadow, unexplained in its emptiness, a mystery of missing numbers. Perhaps it was the nature of things, the way a fire burns brightest at the start and then fades to embers, that saw this project wane. In March, there came a reckoning, a challenge to stir the ashes—Carpool Challenge Week—a desperate bid to breathe life once more into what had nearly faded. And indeed, the logs rose again, a testament to the struggle against the inevitable, against the ebb of engagement and the fickle nature of interest.\n\nYet there lay another struggle in this, one that ran deeper than mere numbers. The road calls with its freedom, its independence, the car a symbol of autonomy deeply rooted in the soul of the people. To tempt them away, to lure them to another path, required more than mere entreaties. Prizes were offered, tokens of encouragement: gift certificates, small treasures for local indulgences. But what if there had been more? A bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car—a dream to chase, a spark to ignite the drifting interest. The prizes remained static, unchanged through the journey, but had they grown, had they offered more, perhaps the tide would have turned in December, perhaps January would not have felt so desolate. The thought lingers, the what-ifs dance in the shadows, and one can only wonder what might have been.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon a collection of early Edison films, a trove of moving pictures that seemed to whisper of a time long vanished. Among them, the trick films held my attention, fifteen in number, spanning the years 1895 to 1901. These were not merely films but illusions spun from the loom of creative editing, each frame a sleight of hand. My study lingered there, tracing the poetic form of these cinematic conjurings, noting the divergences that marked the later reels with a kind of evolutionary boldness. At the turn of the century, the trick film sat bound within its stage, framed by the stoic proscenium, the camera still as stone, capturing the world in long and medium shots, adhering to the creed of one shot equating to one film. Yet, some dared to defy this rigid doctrine, weaving in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nThe films were held in a shared embrace by their setting—a fixed interior, a proscenium view that rooted its essence in the theater, in the flickering world of vaudeville and magic shows. The camera, a sentinel in its place, did not stir to follow the dance of figures or objects. This immobility was a hallmark of the age, a tether to the theater's past, where the stage was the world entire. In these frames, the actors moved only side to side, a lateral ballet with no voyage toward the lens. Take, for instance, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the performers entered from the right, tracing their paths along a horizontal script. Even as they slipped beyond the frame's edge, the camera remained steadfast.\n\nThe proscenium's gaze favored the long shot, occasionally bending to a medium, but never closer, never a whisper of the close-up. This was the theater's doing, a tradition where the audience beheld the whole, framed by the stage's borders. The actors, anchored in the middle ground, ventured no nearer, and so the close-up remained a stranger.\n\nIn the main, these early trick films played by the rule that one envisioned shot equaled a film, confining their stories to a minute's breath, shaped by the frames per second. This brevity curtailed the narrative ambition, the films becoming more akin to vaudeville's quick tricks—magic, vanishments, transformations—brief spectacles without a tale to tell. Yet, the notion of one shot in the viewer's eye was but an illusion; a single \"shot\" could be a tapestry of many, stitched together to conjure apparitions or make bodies vanish. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), among the first of its kind. To the viewer, it seemed a seamless vision, but look closely and see where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" takes its cue, a revelation in the guise of a singular shot.",
            "In the old bones of the Gothic Novel lies a contradiction, an oxymoron of 'Old-New' as Ian Watt lays bare in his exploration of this literary breed. This Gothic form, both scorned and revered, accused of shallowness and celebrated for its terrible grandeur, took its first breath in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Here was a weaving of the ancient with the so-called modern, a birthing of the proto-Gothic that forged a new tongue for telling tales. Walpole drew from the ancient stage, from the mimicry of the world in 'modern' narratives, to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre stood draped in echoes of medieval stagecraft, of towering architecture, of old ways and rites. Even as The Castle of Otranto saw the light, 'gothic' was a word worn by many styles and eras, seen as relic or crude in the face of modern strides in society and letters. Yet in that meeting of theatrical Gothic with the new novel's form, where characters' minds lay bare to the reader, the Gothic endured, living and dying anew to readers far from its genesis.\n\nOne theme that wound tight through Gothic novels was chivalry. That medieval code, the shaping of a knight, found both echo and change in The Castle of Otranto. To those Gothic scribes, chivalry was a beacon, a symbol of brave and noble knights, a dream lost in the mire of their own times. Through chivalry's lens, the Gothic past became a golden age, a romantic ideal to mend the present. Walpole, caught in the storm of politics and shadowed by claims of injustice, perhaps saw in the Gothic age a purity lost to his own. This thought took shape in his characters, like Frederic, who bore the chivalric mantle. Before Frederic steps from the page, he is painted with the strokes of a bygone knight, a prince, scarred by tragedy, thought slain by infidels. This \"gallant and courteous Knight\" stands larger than life, a figure drawn in excess, a harbinger of the Gothic's future form.",
            "In the ghostly corridors of commerce, where shadows of goods traverse the earth from the whispered wants of the customer through the raw sinews of creation, there lies the tale of supply chain management. Born in the year of nineteen hundred and eighty-two at the hands of Keith Oliver, a soul given to consulting, this tale speaks of the orchestration of needs and wills, of time and place, all to sate the hunger of the market with a cold efficiency. Six are the pillars that hold this spectral edifice aloft: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is upon these that the managers of business lay their weary hands to summon forth service to their kin, the customer.\n\nProduction, the first whisper in this chain of shadows, is the bedrock upon which all else is built. It is the questioner, asking when and where, why and how all must be wrought from the earth. The manager, a seer of sorts, peers into the market, that great oracle, to divine the desires of the masses. Once the runes of demand are cast and the market's heart revealed, decisions are made as to what shall be brought into the light and in what number. The where of it, the place of birthing, is chosen with care, the plant that shall nurture the goods to meet the demands and desires of the world. With place decided, the burdens of scheduling and the maintenance of the great machines fall upon the manager's shoulders. Each detail must be a thread in the tapestry, lest the whole unravel and precious time and gold be lost to the winds.\n\nIn the days when I labored under the roofs of Wal-Mart and Target, I saw these designs, these books of process, each a scripture of order from the garments worn by the worker to the rhythm of trucks arriving with their burdens. Such outlines bring a clarity where confusion might otherwise reign, a map through the labyrinth of commerce.\n\nThe second pillar of this shadowed realm is supply. Here lies the strategy, the decisions that shape the very bones of a facility, the alliances forged with other hands to strengthen the weave. A product may have many faces and many homes, each division with its own tools and craftsmen. It falls upon the manager to discern the best path, the best division for each task, or to seek the hands of others beyond their walls. It is velocity they seek, that swift dance of quality and adaptability, all while keeping the wolf of cost at bay.\n\nThus is the tale of supply chain management told, a tapestry of decisions and designs, where each move echoes through the halls of commerce, forever shaping the shadows upon the land.",
            "In the vast tapestry of Victorian literature, the threads of detail and aristocratic focus weave a common pattern. Yet, in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the weave frays and twists into something other. Here lies mystery, a penchant for the bizarre, a departure from the expected that breathes depth into their characters, revealing souls laid bare by the winds of their peculiar worlds.\n\nIn the shadows of Oliver Twist, there lingers a passage where bewilderment reigns. \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nSuch dreams and waking nightmares cloak Oliver Twist in a shroud of enigma, revealing the boy's heartaches and the shadows that lurk around him. As Oliver revisits the moment of his shooting, reality bends to dreams, and in that bending, a truth emerges. The world around him, a maelstrom in which he is but a leaf, carries him without his will. The hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit echo through the fog of his mind, and the pain of his wound becomes a constant, a companion in fear rather than surprise. The question of whose hand guides this fate rises like smoke, for it is not Oliver's own. This incident is a testament to his powerlessness, his inability to wrest control from the grip of fate, even when life hangs by a thread. A whisper of defeat creeps into the narrative, the shadow of Fagin's influence casts long over the boy, carving acceptance from despair, dulling his will to fight. Else he might have struggled, if for nothing more than survival.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\n\nIn these pages, the day and night are as phantoms, slipping through the fingers, leaving the characters adrift in their wake. Such is the nature of this Victorian mystery, a departure into the unknown, where the heart is laid bare, and the soul finds its voice in the shadows of its time.",
            "In the years gone by, I found myself bound in the duty of guiding young minds in the hours after school had ended. Small souls gathered there, each wrestling with their own particular trials in the realm of letters and numbers, but it was the written word where I found my own strength lay. There was a boy, Adrian, a lad no older than ten who found himself at odds with the act of reading. The letters on the page confounded him, some he pronounced as if they were old friends, others as though they were strangers he had never met. He was a child of Latino heritage, yet his English rolled off the tongue as naturally as if he were born to it. We stumbled through the morass of incomprehension until the day I crossed paths with his mother. She came like a shadow into the small room where I lingered with a few stragglers, my charges for the afternoon. The woman spoke only in her native Spanish, a tongue I knew but little of, yet we managed to bridge the chasm of language between us. It was then that the truth revealed itself with the weight of certainty: Adrian could read, but the English script was an unfamiliar terrain to him. Whether this revelation served to aid him I cannot say, but the hope remains that he finds himself on surer ground now.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the chasm that exists in the schools, particularly in a place such as California, where tongues are as varied as the colors of the sky at dusk. It is a reminder that the struggle with language is often hidden beneath the surface, that even a child whose speech flows with ease may find the written word a formidable adversary. The question that arises is what course to chart from here? For Adrian, it was a matter of guiding him through the intricacies of English pronunciation and the alphabet. Yet for the multitude who scarcely know English, the journey is fraught with greater complexity. The answer is not singular or simple. The dual language system, immersion in the mainstream, private guides, classes for those learning English as a second tongue—none alone can surmount this barrier. The path lies in the weaving together of all these threads.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not only for those whose first breath was in Spanish but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" the words echoing like a prophecy. There is fear and whisperings that such endeavors squander resources, that the many will find no gain. But these are lies. Were we to embrace such methods as the rule and not the exception, all would reap the harvest. But how to proceed? Shall we decree that all who teach must speak in two tongues? No, that is a dream too far. Yet, what hinders us from bringing forth aides and tutors, those who walk in both worlds and can guide others across the divide?",
            "From the time we're young, they tell us there's something grander than us, something beyond the grasp of our understanding. Some go to Sunday school, others to Temple, and some dig deep within themselves for answers. Many of us take up the faiths handed down by our kin. Yet, there are those who turn their backs entirely, denying anything exists beyond their own narrow world. We might cling to one set of beliefs only to later cast them aside for another. Whatever path we tread, we're seeking to carve out a piece of who we are through our own spiritual lenses. We search for a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favored bird. We sat on the front porch, the rain beating a rhythm on the tin roof above, both of us with cigarettes in hand. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants lined up along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part lost in memory. He'd grown frail in those past months, his clothes hanging loose from his frame. His hair, too, had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. His eyes stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine. A loneliness settled in, a fear that kept words trapped inside, for speaking them might make it all too real. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in staring into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father left this world in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his pain but stretched his days past what the doctors had foreseen. What worth was there in suffering longer, I couldn't say. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I whispered no prayers. If God was there, I figured He'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to watch him slip from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear witness to the end of the life that gave me mine. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to bear witness to his end. I curled up in bed, buried myself there for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo call ever came.",
            "In the time when the land lay unburdened by the weight of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a sentinel of Republicanism, carved from the very soil he tilled. An agrarian by heart and trade, his brief foray into the realm of politics left a mark of resolute conviction on the pages of governance—a voice that rang clear in the defense of the individual's liberty and the rights of man against the encroaching tide of authority. His allegiance to the agrarian creed shaped his thoughts like the furrowed lines of the earth, bearing seeds that would sprout opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary, each one tethered to the notion of a pastoral ideal.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a canvas unmarked by the hands of tradition, a place where the architects of government could craft something pure and untamed—a self-governing Eden. He held firm to the belief in natural rights, those intrinsic to the human spirit, each one knotted to the other, a tapestry that would unravel if even one thread was pulled. Such rights, he declared, must remain beyond government's grasp, for in the untamed state of nature, it was the cunning and the strong who reaped the spoils. But in civilization, this must not be so.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor reckoned, a government must be wrought that embraces the dual nature of man—his capacity for both light and shadow. To him, the morals of government were but a reflection of man's own virtues and sins. He spoke of good principles, those that safeguarded the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and fended off the specter of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles could endure, he argued, even under the sway of self-interest, that perpetual engine of human endeavor, so long as it did not gnaw at the foundations of the common good to fatten itself upon others. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's innate darkness, ever watchful to prevent the taint of vile principles.\n\nIn chorus with his fellow Republicans, Taylor demanded a Constitution interpreted not loosely but with the precision of a craftsman's hand. He envisioned a Federal government circumscribed by the explicit words of that sacred text, wary of the expansive beast that might grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he warned of the perils in an interpretation devoid of the framers' intent, for such a path was fertile ground for corruption. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true testament of the Union, a covenant that spoke of a confederacy of sovereign states, not a singular nation bound by fetters unseen.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast down, the world narrowing to the scene before him, yet his mind remained a vast blank canvas. The gaze was steady, devoid of emotion, a practiced detachment that absorbed every detail without assigning meaning or context. Thoughts came and went, ephemeral whispers, barely settling before they vanished, leaving behind the purity of perception untainted by conscious reflection.\n\nOnce, an artist he knew had suggested a book, a tome called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, an offering that promised to unlock the mysteries of form and line. Since childhood, a desire to capture the world in graphite and charcoal had lingered within him. The book spoke of framing, of taking a world too intricate to grasp and reducing it to something manageable—a bowl of fruit, isolated from the chaos of kitchen and dining room.\n\nYet, as he stood, eyes fixed on the vessel before him, the mental frame eluded him. Overwhelmed, he could do nothing but stand in silent testament to the spectacle laid out. Like Picasso lost in blue or Monet awash in green, he stood on the cusp of an artistic revelation—his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers, delicate in their task, found the tool of his craft. Muscles tensed and released, guiding his hand in fluid arcs, a dancer's grace in the execution of necessity. The water churned, a crystalline ballet, carrying away fragments of the scene. Once more, his hand found the lever, a nervous urgency propelling the motion, but the obstinate form resisted, anchored to the porcelain depths.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted as if to weather a storm, the green tie a noose around his neck. A frown creased his brow as he regarded the offensive castoff, a message of sorts from those who frequented the Rite Aid restrooms, a testament to the labors of those who cleaned. After several attempts, each one a meditation on futility, his hand reached to the side, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it thickly around his fingers until it became a crude glove. \n\nHe straightened, then bent once more, the hand descending into the bowl with the slow inevitability of a ritual, like a pilgrim's hand reaching into fire for a sacred relic.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of consequence young lives are snuffed out behind the wheel. Factors converge in a grim symphony, a deadly vector for the freshest faces of American roads. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth that the adolescent mind is a realm unprepared for the dark ballet of driving. Inexperience lies coiled at the heart of it, a serpent in the garden, birthing not only fatal crashes but a litany of rollovers, reckless speed, and the inevitable veering from the road's edge. \n\nAmongst their peers they fare worse, as any soul with a mote of sense might reckon they would, wandering in packs as is their wont. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted the link between the age of those carried and the frequency of their misfortune on the asphalt. \n\nCalifornia and her sister states have tried to weave a net of safety, granting only provisional licenses that bind the hands of the young, setting limits on the hours they may roam and forbidding the carriage of other minors. Yet such measures are but stopgaps, mere patches on a yawn of an abyss. The youngest among us are, by every accounting of statistical markers, ill-equipped to wield the weight of such responsibility. \n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a psychologist who peers into the workings of the young mind, posits even eighteen years is too tender for a regular license to drive. In USA Today, Zuckerman’s research speaks of a common lust among those not yet nineteen or twenty, a hunger for the thrill of risk. It stands to reason then, that driving should be delayed, the itch of thrill-seeking allowed to wane. \n\nIf we persist in issuing licenses to these young fledglings, the roads will continue to drink deep of their blood, and the toll will rise to towering heights. By the year of 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will be of age to grip the wheel and a legion of new teen drivers will unfurl upon the highways. \n\nLegislation to address this is a simple enough affair. Let the schools keep to their classrooms, teaching the ways of the road, but let no one under eighteen command a vehicle. A provisional permit, yes, before a full license, and let there be a reckoning of hours spent learning the craft behind the wheel. The number of hours, a figure drawn from the states’ own books, like California with its six hours of direct training and fifty hours in the company of an adult. The grim ledger of teen driving stretches across this land, and thus a uniform national law seems a reasonable means, a shield to guard the youth from themselves. Such legislation is no new dawn, but perhaps it is a lantern in the dark.",
            "In the quiet reaches of the mind where sound is meant to find its way, there lies a disorder, a tangled skein of miscommunication. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it. Or Auditory Processing Disorder if you prefer your terms less ensnaring. It's a discord in the brain's symphony, where the central nervous system fails to harmonize the notes that wander in from the outside world. A condition not of the ear but of the understanding, where the music heard does not translate to the music felt.\n\nThe disorder's tale begins in the mid-century past, a time when children with voices trapped within sought release. They called it auditory imperception then, a name as cumbersome as the disorder itself. Italian minds—Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari—cast their nets wide over the mystery in 1954, and by '61, Kimura introduced a new lens, dichotic testing, a means to unravel the physiology of perception. The story unfolded further in '77, when minds gathered to press forward the understanding of children thus afflicted.\n\nIn its myriad manifestations, CAPD whispers confusion into the ear. A person may find themselves adrift in spaces where sounds drift aimlessly, unable to anchor their source. Discrimination is a task unfit for such ears, as the cacophony of the world layers itself indistinguishably. Patterns in sound become enigmatic, speech loses its tonal depth, sarcasm slips unnoticed beneath the waves of conversation. Sounds overlap, one masking the other, and the sequence of auditory events becomes as indecipherable as an ancient script.\n\nDiagnosis, elusive as it is, requires a tapestry of observation and testing. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists—they all take their turns at unraveling the disorder's mystery. They watch, they listen, they question. But no single tool exists, no definitive test to hold the truth aloft. Instead, they challenge the ears with a multitude of sounds, seeking the patterns hidden within the chaos. Advanced methods probe deeper, recording the echoes within and measuring the soul's response to its own dissonance.\n\nIn this world of sound and silence, the disorder remains a shadow, its cause a whisper lost on the wind. But in the pursuit of understanding, there is hope, a light to guide those who find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, searching for the shore.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I find myself drawn along a path leading to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to cast a light for children shadowed by abuse and neglect, and to offer solace to families adrift in turmoil. The values I bring to this field are not mere attributes but the very bedrock of my being: service, respect, an ethical compass, and a dedication to fostering relationships and honing my craft to remain steadfast and competent. These are not simply the tenets of social work; they are the marrow of my own soul.\n\nThere was always a yearning within me to aid others, yet the path was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and college, I saw many souls lost to the fog of denial, some seeking refuge in ways less than ideal. Witnessing such trials, I embarked on a journey to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the road ahead lay obscured, and so I paused after stepping forth from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, under a sun that bore witness, I visited a friend and met a boy of sixteen, his form tense upon her couch. He had come seeking refuge from an existence marred by abusive parents. The next day, the law was summoned to his home, and I went there, driven by a need to help. Speaking to the officers, I shared my concerns, and they listened as I told them of my education. They asked if I might speak with the parents. Their words were laced with unease, painting their son as a manipulator who sought intervention for what they claimed were mere trifles. It was in this moment, amidst the tangled truths and half-lies, that I realized my calling lay in social work, to aid those ensnared by such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, holds its place among my values. As a society, we raise a lament for the lost yet cling to traditions that stifle the very individuality we claim to cherish. If we mourn the lost, why do we chase sameness? I have never found comfort in such confines. Throughout my days in high school and college, I stood against the tide of social injustice: coloring my hair against convention, clothing myself in garments that sang of my spirit, piercing beyond the norm, joining the GSBA to declare my stance, fighting against the specters of racism and discrimination whenever they reared their heads. I believe in justice's cause, and I will continue to champion it against the dark.",
            "In the gloom of the scholarly inquiry, there lies the study of insomnia, the affliction that haunts the night with its silent pallor, and the paper before us seeks to unravel its mysteries through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model, with its roots deep in the hereditary soil, examines the genetic tapestry and medical nuances woven into the fabric of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the worldly bonds of environment, race, ethnicity, and the stark demarcations of demographic and socioeconomic boundaries. In this review, the shroud is lifted from insomnia as these models are laid bare, each piece of research dissected to illuminate the models, and then scrutinized, their strengths and frailties laid open to the world.\n\nThe realm of sleep, where disorders creep unseen, can be divided into primary sleep disorders, those tied to mental disquiet, and those born of other maladies. Within the primary lies Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while disorders linked to mental discord trace back to Axis I or Axis II afflictions. Still others rise from medical tribulations or the shadow of substances. The Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others—stand as sentinels of disrupted slumber, each with its tale of woe. Primary Insomnia, the thief of rest, and Primary Hypersomnia, the relentless sleep, both linger for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its specters of cataplexy and automatic REM, joins them in this dance of unrest. While Dyssomnias battle with the onset and maintenance of sleep, Parasomnias arise from behavioral and physiological anomalies, with nightmares and terrors as their harbingers. The disorders bound to mental discord, tied to Axis I or II, weave a different story. This review, however, turns its focus to insomnia, a solitary beacon amid the primary sleep disorders, as it relates to the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nIn the biological sphere, the whispers of genes and the echoes of heredity intertwine with the physiological chorus of sleep disorders. Within the hypothalamic shadows, neurons harboring orexin hold the reins of slumber and wakefulness. A study, with mice as its earthly avatars, discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, guardians of sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when called to arms, ushers in sleep, yet if silenced, it quells anxiety and beckons rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, though drawn from the world of mice, hint at echoes in the human realm, whispering of a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor. A flaw or absence in this receptor might mar one's ability to grasp sleep's embrace without aid. The sociocultural echoes of this study suggest that an inherited phenotype could dictate the dance of sleep, and any disruption in the receptor's song would ripple through life's tapestry, casting shadows on school, work, and the mundane tasks that require unwavering focus.",
            "He'd been wandering the paths of University Park now for what seemed like an eternity, though in truth it was but two and a half years, or four and a half semesters if one counted by the calendar's reckoning. In those early days, finding his way from place to place had been a trial, an ordeal of distance and weather. His first year had seen him lodged in a dormitory at the far eastern edge of the campus, beyond which lay only the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, great monuments in the emptiness. From his sanctuary in Stuart Hall, the journey to places like Willard building, set near the heart of the campus, stretched to an ungodly twenty-five minutes on foot, the trek made worse by the capricious weather that seemed to haunt State College.\n\nHe'd spoken with those who'd come before, alumni not much older than himself, who spoke of a time when the halls in the east were cut off from the rest of the world by vast barren lands. Those lands were now swallowed by sports fields, grand edifices like the new Creamery, and a health services building, all encircled by a sprawl of apartments. As the campus swelled and spread, so too did the difficulty of traversing it. The question that loomed like a shadow was how best to navigate this ever-growing expanse. The answer, simple yet profound, lay in the humble bicycle. Yet a bike alone was not enough; it needed the will of the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend, one who had returned to cycling after a long absence. His friend marveled at why he had ever given it up. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.\" In his words lay a truth as clear as the morning sun. Bicycling, in its simplicity, was the most efficient path. A bowl of oatmeal and the push of the legs could carry a soul thirty miles or more. Living off campus now, as far-flung as any dormitory, he'd come to see the wisdom in owning a bike. Each day he faced the prospect of reaching the Thomas building, a place that by foot would consume a quarter of an hour or more. Yet astride his bike, the wind in his face, he could reach it in five if he rode with purpose. The road that beckoned, Pollock Road, was the most direct route, though not without its challenges. Walking had its merits, but time was a commodity he could not afford to waste. Without his bike, the walk to Thomas would steal away thirty or forty minutes from each day, amounting to more than two and a half hours of lost time each week. Time he could not spare, for life was a tapestry of classes and appointments and other obligations that demanded his presence. He knew then, as he knew now, that the bicycle was not merely a means to an end, but a companion on this journey through the wilderness of education.",
            "In the pages of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the looming shadow of technology and the capitalist scaffold it rests upon cast a pall over humanity. The world he spins is one where the individual is subsumed into the mass, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the creed learned from the cradle. The people, mere pawns in a grander scheme, are held in thrall by a singular doctrine decreed by the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's lurking doubts about the paths these systems have hewn. Words like homogeny and reification, borrowed from Marxist discourse, underscore the novel's critique of the nascent economic order of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist concept. The common folk, their eyes blindfolded to the true ties that bind them to other classes, chase after their own gain, oblivious to the strings that control them. This ideological dominance over the proletariat and the everyday laborer is starkly portrayed in the conditioning of Brave New World's denizens. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, move through life without volition; their slumbering minds echo with the chants of consumption and indulgence, all orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the total domination of social classes by a separate few, is evident here. The lower classes, blissfully ignorant, invest in an ideology that props up the very structure that enslaves them—capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, possess the awareness but seldom act, save for a few like Bernard who stir against their chains. The interplay of these social strata offers a window into capitalism's perceived yoke.\n\nIn this brave new world, true connections between souls are but a mirage. Characters meld into a faceless throng, even those of prominence, their depths unexplored. Perhaps Huxley whispers of a world where technology and capitalism, hand in hand, strip away man's will and voice. Love is a ghost, emotions muted to dull hums; interactions are but surface ripples, evident in the men’s idle prattle about women’s physical traits, the pneumatic allure, and the women’s unabashed recounting of their liaisons. The classes' contentment with their station speaks to the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles mirrors Marxist reflections on the proletariat, lulled into believing their supremacy as long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "Four years past, I found myself in a course on Islam at CBC, a place of learning where discourse ran hot like the sands of some ancient desert. The question that flared bright among us was whether Islam bore hostility in its heart. This inquiry feels ever more pressing in the shadow of years since the towers fell. I have watched the tides of media shift from angered waves casting Islam in shadow to a strange tide of acceptance in this land of ours. In those days of 2001, could we have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage, rising to seek the mantle of leadership?\n\nThe tale of the Prophet, it calls to me with its contradictions. What history tells of Muhammad seems at odds with the portrait painted in the pages of his life. I had been taught that Muhammad was a man who wielded faith as a weapon, subduing tribes beneath the banner of Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, a figure misunderstood and humble, gathering followers by truth alone. They came to him, it says, drawn by the light of his teachings.\n\nAnd there are echoes here of another story, of Jesus and the miracles wrought in his time. The Prophet, it is said, took mutton and milk, multiplying them to feed forty souls. Such tales, penned to show Muhammad as a humble prophet of miracles, seem to me a theft of the divine story of Christ. It is as if they cloak the life of Jesus in the garb of another, seeking to borrow the light of his deeds.\n\nThe biography spins many tales of conversion, of souls turning to Islam by their own sight. Yet these are stories told through layers of voices, each a whisper from another's lips. This chain of hearsay, meant to lend truth, leaves me uneasy. It casts doubt upon the tale, like shadows on a moonlit path.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood. They speak of him as gentle, wise, and humble. But history's voice tells of a different man, of a rise to power marked not by gentleness but by force. I wonder if those who follow him now know the true story that lies beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the passage of time, the teachings of Jesus seemed to vanish like whispers in a storm, left behind as the tides of Christian thought surged forth. As one gazes upon the sprawling canvas of history, a picture emerges of a faith that has drifted from its moorings, its origins obscured by the dust of ages. Our present world, with its burgeoning awareness and fervent march toward progress, stands in stark contrast. Tradition clings to the hearts of some, those who guard their inherited truths with unyielding fervor. Yet, their numbers may not suffice to sway the collective course. Among believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken in the years to come. A restless hunger will arise to peel away the layers of doctrine accreted over time, to uncover the essence of what the Nazarene intended. It may span decades or centuries, but the tide will turn inexorably. A great unwinding will occur in the annals of Christian history, a reversion to the wellspring of its inception. A movement will gather strength, stripping away the accumulated dogmas as if time itself were reversing, leaving only the purest vision of what Jesus imparted to humanity, unmarred by the claims of later thinkers. When this wave sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes into its embrace, the church will remain, a steadfast beacon to guide the way. Yet, as theological time rewinds, the vast diversity that has flourished within Christendom will yield to a growing unity of belief and practice. Where once divisions lay between regions, denominations, and sects, there will emerge a tapestry of shared convictions. History is replete with reversals of fortune. Recall how Christians, once hunted and reviled by the Roman Empire, later saw that empire don the mantle of their faith. Our nation has journeyed from the bondage of African-American slavery to the heights of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, unraveling history's tapestry to seek its source, diminishing diversity in the process. It is vital to recognize that this transformation will hinge on a reading of Jesus' words as metaphor, not as literal decree. What, then, transpired since the days of Jesus? If we cast our gaze far enough back, we find only Judaism, the theological seedbed from which Christianity sprang forth. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures formed the bedrock by the time Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Yet, even among the Jews, unity was scarce. They fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a multitude of common folk, each with their own spirit and path.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle lies the truth of man’s nature, a revelation of greed and self-interest that festers deep within. An exposition of souls eager to clutch only at their own desires, blind to the plight of those beneath them. The tale unfolds amid the great ironworks and factories, where the owners and overseers are consumed by the lust to grow their empires vast and unyielding. They care not for the lives crushed beneath the wheels of their progress, their eyes cast only forward, oblivious to the ruin left in their wake. As Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the pollution pouring forth, an indifference to the harm inflicted upon man and beast alike. The smoke, a river of despair, the waste from the pens a testament to their disregard.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the relentless machine, toil under the lash of commerce. Their lives weighed against the almighty dollar, their worth less than the coin that buys their labor. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The hours are long, the breaks nonexistent, the threat of dismissal without warning a shadow that hovers ever close. In this time, this era of unchecked power, the law offers no shelter. The owners unleash their demands with impunity, the laborers driven faster, the conditions squalid and unforgiving.\n\nNo agency stands to offer aid, no voice to call out the injustices. The unions, twisted in their purpose, prey upon the very men they claim to protect. Sinclair’s words cut deep, revealing a population caught in the grip of a merciless machine. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A slavery of a different kind, no less harsh, no less consuming. The men and women of Packingtown, bound to their fate, their lives a testament to the cruelty of unchecked ambition.",
            "In the shadows of a world half-remembered, there lies a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, a piece he held in some esteem, called \"Dream-Land.\" Within its woven lines, the name \"Thulé\" rises, a specter from both Virgil's pen and a further origin, more recent yet no less ethereal. Virgil spoke of Thulé, a distant isle, a whisper at the edge of the world known to ancient Greeks. Yet Poe, a man drawn to the currents of German thought, found another source, a voice that beckoned from beyond the veil of time. \n\nThere is a tale told by Karl J. Arndt, of Poe's dance with the ghost of Goethe. In Arndt's telling, Poe's verses echo those of Goethe, a mimicry or perhaps a homage. The Oxford Companion whispers of Goethe, a master of words, his Faust a crown of poetic drama, split across the years, the first act in 1808, the second as Goethe himself passed into the shadow in 1832. Amidst this magnum opus lies a sliver of verse, \"The King of Thulé,\" a lament of loss and a goblet heavy with memory. A king bereft, drowning in drink, and at last, casting his last tie to the world into the sea before following it into the abyss.\n\nThe king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" mirrors this tragic monarch, a shadowy reflection in a world of half-light. Poe, a soul perhaps haunted by loss and the numbing balm of the bottle, saw in this tale a kinship. Less than a year before he penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invoked Thule, a word like a talisman, twice in his collected works. In \"Dream-Land,\" Thule bookends the tale, a dark twin to Goethe's king. The landscape painted in Poe's verses is one of desolation, a haunted land where specters of lost friends roam, a realm stripped of color.\n\nPoe's admiration for Goethe, if not directly, was perhaps filtered through his esteem for Tennyson, a poet of great regard. In the echoes of Tennyson's verses, Poe might have heard the refrains of Goethe, a melody carried on the winds of literary creation, in the many iterations that surfaced after the original had been cast into the world. In those lines, the shadow of Thule looms, a place both real and imagined, a bridge between the realms of the living and the dead.",
            "In the quiet aisles of the grocery store, under the indifferent watch of fate and the fluorescent glow of the overhead lights, an applesauce spill lay waiting. A customer might wonder if such an innocuous event could unravel into something larger, something with consequences that stretch beyond the simple act of slipping and falling. For Jennifer Palmer, it did. She found herself entwined in a narrative of negligence and disregard, a tale told not by words but by the actions of a manager who turned a blind eye.\n\nPaul Martin, the manager, had been informed. Once, twice. The applesauce spill was not a secret, hidden in the shadows. Rich Wayne, a dutiful employee, brought it to light at five in the afternoon, and again, Mary J. Haddigan spoke of it. Each time, Martin's response was the same, a dismissive shrug, a preoccupation with his dinner, the mundane over the immediate. By half-past five, Jennifer Palmer lay on the cold, hard floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's indifference.\n\nIn the courts of California, they speak of malice. Of actions taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm they might cause. They speak of despicable acts, of conduct so far removed from the common decency expected of mankind that it demands retribution. Palmer would argue that Martin's knowledge of past injuries, his awareness of the peril the spill posed, should have stirred him to action. Yet, like the indifferent hands of a clock ticking away the minutes, he let the danger persist.\n\nThe question was not whether she could claim her due for the injury sustained, but whether she could reach beyond the tangible and claim punitive damages. For in California, to breach an obligation, to act with oppression, fraud, or malice, is to open oneself to the weight of justice. And Martin's actions, or lack thereof, might well be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of others. As the statute reads, malice might not require intent to harm but merely the willful ignorance of potential harm.\n\nPalmer's tale was not of a single fall, but of a pattern, a series of incidents ignored. In 2009, five slip-and-fall incidents had already marked the history of D&D Markets, and yet, Martin's actions remained unchanged. The narrative of negligence wound through the months, leading inexorably to Palmer's fall. And now, she stood on the precipice of justice, the law as her guide, seeking not just compensation, but a recognition of the wrong inflicted by Martin's callous indifference.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the courts will hear her plea for punitive damages, whether they will see in Martin's actions the malice required by law. But in the gathering shadows of the courtroom, as the echoes of past judgments linger in the air, one thing is clear: the story of Jennifer Palmer and the applesauce spill is more than a simple tale of injury. It is a testament to the power of accountability, a reminder that actions, no matter how small, can have consequences vast and far-reaching. And that justice, though sometimes slow, is relentless in its pursuit.",
            "She had always felt as if there was something she needed, some yearning etched deep within her bones. It was a longing that refused to be quelled, a desire unfulfilled. It began when she was about fourteen, just stepping into the threshold of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years on at the age of seventeen. By now, she had come to know it was not a thing she craved, but a someone. Yet no boy stirred her interest. There were those who had been drawn to her, stumbling through their awkward rituals to charm the uncharmable, but none found her favor. She often questioned herself, pondering this oddity, searching for reasons why such a strange thing would plague a girl her age. Years of contemplation had birthed theories, but none held enough truth for her to dwell upon. So she lived her life, a constant interrogation of her own desires.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle folk, calm and untroubled. They never quarreled, not with each other, and seldom with their daughter. The only discord arose from her pursuit of independence, her free spirit clashing against their quietude. She was a daughter born of placid stock, yet she countered their tranquility with her vibrant personality, making her quite likable alongside her inherent kindness.\n\nToday, however, peace was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, a short scream pierced the air, her mother's voice, once lovely, now strained. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, breathless. Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face, each breath an \"Ow\" escaping her lips. Her daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words came in gasps, squeezed out through the veil of agony. \"Okay, Mom, tell me how I can help.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital awaited with its scent of antiseptic and fear, a place where sickness held court. Yet she was blind to it all, her mind consumed with the task of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly, calling out for assistance. Faces, etched with worry, converged around them. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for examination. The girl was left alone, seated in the waiting room, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase hidden in the highest cabinet, a simple misstep that had brought them here.",
            "In the quiet pursuit of understanding what lay beneath the surface of human frailty, a study set out across the land to uncover the mysteries of the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet as it came to be known. Word carried that this way of living, mirrored in a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, held promises of guarding against the harsh grasp of chronic heart disease and stroke, and even the shadows of stroke mortality. This aMed diet, a variation upon the Mediterranean theme, spoke of a life rich in the bounty of the earth—plant foods and their proteins, fruits and nuts of the land, grains whole and legumes. It favored the warmth of olive oils over the cold of saturated fats and asked for the creatures of the sea over those of the land. It allowed for modest toasts with wine, for it did not demand asceticism.\n\nThe old tales of prior studies whispered of a bond between the Med diet and a lesser burden of death, both total and of the heart. One trial, like an ancient saga, showed this diet more potent than the path of low-fat living, helping shed the weight of flesh and balance the blood's humors. Yet in the past, the focus had not lain upon the specter of stroke or its lethal kin.\n\nThis tale followed the journey of 74,886 women, bound by the Nurses' Health Study, wandering from their youth into the autumn of age, with no history of cardiac or diabetic ills. Over two decades, from 1984 to 2004, they bore witness through their own words, self-reported visions of their feasts upon questionnaires designed to capture the essence of their dietary past year by year. In this passage of time, more than ninety-five in a hundred remained steadfast. The tales they told were verified against the hard truth of records and certificates, though some stories, lacking proof, were deemed probable, and so they entered this chronicle—tales of stroke and heart's failure.\n\nTo see clearly through the haze of chance, the scholars took the scores from the aMed diet, each a whispered echo of years past, and averaged them, seeking a true reflection of long-term fidelity to this diet. They adjusted for life's many confounding paths: age, the smoke of tobacco, the heaviness of body, the hormonal changes of womanhood, the intake of vitamins and spirits, the vigor of one's leisure, and the use of aspirin.\n\nThey employed the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, their way of seeing the unseen threads linking aMed scores to the risk of heart and stroke, separating the fatal from the nonfatal, each type its own story.\n\nIn the end, the tale told of women who walked the path of the Mediterranean diet with fidelity, who bore higher aMed scores, and who found themselves less burdened by the specter of heart disease and stroke. Over the span of twenty years, there appeared 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 deaths from the silent killer of cardiovascular disease. Those women who stood in the highest quintile of aMed scores faced a lesser risk than those in the lowest, their relative risk a mere 0.71. Thus, the story passed into the annals of time, a testament to the power of the Mediterranean way.",
            "The sign bore the words like a dire whisper from another age. Hitler is alive in Burma. On the corner of the street stood Ellen Page, the actress from Juno, solitary with her placard held aloft. The letters scrawled in Sharpie ink told a tale of unsettling portent. Burma, the land known also as Myanmar, lay in the grip of a brutal militant junta. They had seized power in the year 1962, a coup d’état that cast a long shadow over the nation. The year 2007 saw the streets swell with the first protests in a decade. The monks, clad in robes the color of saffron, led the charge. The Saffron Revolution, they named it, for the hue of their vestments. The populace began to stir, to rise, and the junta soon met them with violence. It was like war. A war waged upon the peaceful, the monasteries stormed by soldiers. Foreign journalists were snatched from the streets, imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty for bearing witness. Official reports spoke of 13 dead, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, whispered of a hidden carnage. “The bodies can be counted in several thousand,” he said.\n\nThis tale is old as time. Governments, since the dawn of civilization, have sought to crush dissent, to hold dominion over their people. The emperors of Rome claimed divine favor for their reign. In Japan, emperors were seen as gods incarnate, leading their people with technology and ritual, and our own president, George W. Bush, spoke regularly with Ted Haggard, who led the Stupid People Worldwide under the Republic Party’s banner.\n\nTales of such tyranny are like shadows cast long across history. The June 4th protest of 1989 at Tiananmen Square comes to mind, where students and intellectuals, laborers and visionaries, gathered to defy the government's iron hand. The numbers of the dead are as disparate as the stories told, the Chinese government speaking of hundreds while the Red Cross whispered of thousands more. Then there was Rwanda, in the 1990s, where the Hutu militias, with the government's aid, began their grim work, the systematic slaughter of the Tutsis and any who dared to moderate. And the specter of Hitler's Third Reich, a shadow that fell across nations, a time of terror for those of Jewish descent, speaks of the extremes to which such power can reach.",
            "In the dim corridors of jazz history, the figure of Duke Ellington rises like a shadow cast long by a setting sun. His presence, a subtle whisper behind the keys, speaks less of the man himself and more of the vast tapestry he wove. A tapestry where each thread, each note, each pause, bore the weight of his genius. Ellington, the silent architect, built cathedrals of sound where the voices of his orchestra soared. In the spaces he created, soloists found their freedom, their voices unfurling like banners in the wind. Yet, beyond the improvisations, there lay a precision, a structure woven tight as the skin of a drum, calling forth the specific hues of his band’s timbre to paint his musical visions. His mastery lay not only in the individual notes but in the grand symphony of souls he orchestrated, each player a vital part of the luminous whole. \n\nThe pages of the Grove Music Dictionary speak of Ellington’s sound, his innovation, as they whisper of the Creole Love Call. In this composition, Ellington’s voice, devoid of words, becomes a color, a texture, a spirit inhabiting the air. It is an early testament to his vision, where voices meld with instruments in a dance of sound and silence. The call and response, a dialogue between voice and reeds, unfolds in the slow pulse of a twelve-bar blues. Each chorus, a chapter in a tale told without words, sings with the raw clarity of life itself. The muted trumpet’s lament, the clarinet’s high cry, the full band’s echo—all converge in a crescendo before settling back into the primal call of voice and reeds. Here, the voice growls, an instrument unto itself, before a trombone’s dissonant mutter brings the tale to a close.\n\nIn the year that followed, as the world turned and the notes of Hot and Bothered filled the air, Ellington’s genius continued its quiet revolution. The call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing intertwines, a dialogue of soul and spirit, of flesh and wind. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) carries this conversation forward, where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone becomes the voice of the earth, grounding the melody in the eternal dance of sound and silence. In these compositions, Ellington’s legacy is not merely heard—it is felt, a pulse beneath the skin, a whisper in the dark.",
            "In the silent corridors of time, where life etches its relentless march, a question lingers like smoke in the hollow of a long-forgotten chamber: why do creatures evolve the way they do? Are there unseen chains that bind and guide the hand of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in the year of 1917, mused upon this and remarked how the language of numbers had yet to capture even the simplest forms that dwell in nature's realm. A sentiment not yet outgrown even by our modern age. Yet, with the passing years, the art of mathematical modeling has been cast upon the spiral shells of mollusks, tracing the lineage of their form through the eons, as Raup and Stanley once did in 1981. Herein, we embark on a journey, a study, to unearth how these mathematical whispers, spoken in the growth and evolution of Prunum, can unravel the mysteries of their becoming. Through the eyes of X-ray, we chart the bones of their shells, setting parameters that the mind might use to dream both of what is and what could be. These numbers find voice in the program CerioShell, a creation of Stone in 1995, conjuring shapes that might dwell within the bounds of what is possible. And alongside these phantoms, experiments and observation weave their tale, seeking to illuminate the grand tapestry of life's change.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a journey—a tube winding its way through the vast compass of time and space. Each turn, each curve, is a whorl spiraling around an imagined axis, the columella, steadfast and true. The pace of its dance varies, and where each whorl meets its next is marked by a suture, a line of demarcation. In the end, it is the largest whorl, the body whorl, that stands as the crowning chapter of its story. The spire, it is called, all whorls save for the last, with the apex a beacon at its tip and the base its anchor. Through an aperture, the creature within peers out, extending into the world beyond.\n\nThese shells, they can be seen from many eyes: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common gaze is apertural, with the opening toward the eye and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nTo count these whorls, one must begin from above, from the apical view. There, the first suture marks the beginning, and from it, a line is drawn to cleave the shell into two. Whorls are tallied from this line, estimated to the quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell, it is a series of doorways, moving through the tapestry of time, as the creature builds its home around itself. One might trace this path, marking the center of each aperture, measuring its breadth and height.\n\nIn this dance of creation, numbers are woven, and once the figures are known, the shell's genesis can be altered, its story rewritten in the language of mathematics.",
            "In the dim lands of Indonesia, where the sun sets upon the archipelago and the night gathers close, the little lives of newborns flicker in the shadows, unmoved by the turning years. The tale of their survival, of mothers too, is a story writ in numbers, a litany of promises unmet. The aims of the Millennium, those lofty goals, loom unfulfilled while water runs clean and the earth is washed of its stains. Yet the hearts of mothers and the breaths of babes still falter in their quest for life, their hopes not yet measured against the mark set for them by time’s unyielding hand.\n\nIn the villages and towns, where the cries of life begin, there are hands that catch and hands that fail. Seventy-two in a hundred now know the touch of those skilled in the art of life’s beginning, yet still, the old ways linger. The midwives, with their ancient wisdom, cannot stave off the blood’s dark tide when it rises, and so the death of mothers is a sorrow all too known, the loss a testament to what yet needs doing. The numbers speak of progress, yet they lie in their silence, for the work remains unfinished.\n\nThe children suffer too, their small bodies wracked by the old foes of water and waste. The healers who once came now come less often, and the care they need after birth is but a shadow, a whisper lost in the wide expanse of this land. The cut that saves, the surgeon’s knife, is a stranger to many, its edge rarely felt. In the cities, it finds its place, yet in the fields, it remains but a rumor, a story told in the hushed voices of women who walk the long road to hope.\n\nAnd in this place of disparity, where the rich find solace in the arms of medicine, the poor stand outside, their hands empty, their pockets bare. The choice that lies before those who would change this tale is a stark one: to carve out a path for each ailment or to weave a broader tapestry that holds all in its embrace. The allure of focused work is bright, its goals clear and its rewards swift. But the cost is high, for to choose one is to forsake another, and the balance tilts, leaving some in shadow.\n\nIn this land of islands, where the sea binds and separates, the question remains: how to care for the mothers and the children, how to bring light to the places where the night has long held sway. It is a question of choices, of paths untaken, of a future yet to be written in the lives of those who wait for the dawn.",
            "In the annals of time stretching back a century, popular music has unfurled into a tapestry so vast and intricate that to name each thread is a fool's errand. The strands of genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each birthing a multitude of offspring, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a lineage unending. Among these, the branch of Heavy Metal stands, a colossus in the realm of popular sound, evolving and shifting over the last four decades into a beast most diverse and expressive. Its voice is a chorus of emotions, a symphony dwelling in the shadows. From its nascent cries, the genre revealed a malleability, a clay in the sculptor's hand, giving rise to myriad forms, each more intricate than the last, until the present where the lines between them blur and fade.\n\nIn this modern epoch, the heavy metal landscape is a labyrinth of niches, each with its own tongue and lore, so much so that the essence of metal itself eludes definition. It is an amalgam, a mingling of echoes from distant genres, yet it remains a creation with roots. To grasp the metal that reverberates through today’s halls, one must seek the heart of the metal movement, for it is not merely a genre but a force, a revolution.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in shadow. It is a symphony of excess, an anthem of more—more bass, more volume, more fury, more spectacle. A departure from the primitive, it demands skill, mastery, and those who wield it, they possess a prowess that bleeds into the music. Metal is a journey down paths of altered states, a testament to the psychedelic haze of the mid-seventies when minds unfurled and creation knew no bounds, the music transcending into realms unknown, drug-fueled and unapologetic. This was music that embraced the visceral, the dark, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that dominated before. The legacy of such darkness finds its roots entwined with the Romantic Era, a time when shadows danced upon the stage of art. The words of songs, like those found in Helter Skelter, speak of this darkness, a descent into chaos that marked the Beatles’ foray into the heavy, a retort to the Rolling Stones, a declaration that they too could walk the paths of shadows.\n\nThus, the tale of metal unfolds, a narrative of darkness and excess, of mastery and movement, echoing through the corridors of time.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would lay their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, crafting his own dreams with the patience of a man who knew them precious. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, stands as a testament not only to a woman's wonderment at a land conjured in sleep but also to Rousseau’s own longings, the visions that drove his brush. Since he first took up the craft, he sought not just to paint but to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold of artists and those who marveled at their creations. Yet this path was not without its trials, a struggle within his heart, torn between the safety of imitation and the wild, uncharted lands of his own imagination. The Dream is a canvas of this struggle, an embodiment of Rousseau's battle to either mimic the styles that might grant him acceptance in the eyes of the art world's elite or to set forth on his own, carving a path through the thicket of his own creativity.\n\nTo ponder The Dream in this light, one must wander back through the story of Rousseau himself. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, northwest of France, his life began not with the strokes of a brush but in the hands of his father, a tinsmith by trade, who knew the comforts of a modest prosperity (Shattuck 47). No academies opened their doors to Rousseau in his youth; instead, he toiled for the nation, a gabelou in the toll service, though those who spoke of him often erred, calling him a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight of his children, left him with but one daughter, Julia, and a sorrow as deep as the ocean (Shattuck 49). In painting, he sought refuge, a new beginning in the colors and forms that might offer solace. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romantic hues, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams as humble and earnest as those of his kin.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's yearning for acknowledgment within the art world is to see it for what it was, a natural longing. He was a man who came late to the canvas, untrained by the formalities of art schools, painting in the shadow of giants. It was only as Matisse began to be whispered about in the circles of art that Rousseau felt the first glimmer of recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon draws a line between the two—Matisse, who feared nothing more than the mundane in art, and Rousseau, whose dream was to create a work so pleasingly conventional that he might gain entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the vast wilderness of thought where the great minds roam, there lies a path that winds between ethics and beauty, truth and their mirrored reflections. Like the words etched upon the ancient urn that Keats once pondered, beauty and truth are intertwined, bound in a dance as old as time itself. We learn much in this life through the schooling of books or the harsh tutelage of experience, yet the appreciation of what is moral and what is beautiful seems innate, a knowledge unspoken and untaught, whispered to us on the winds of existence. These are not matters of dictation but of revelation, a quest to uncover the why behind the art or the act, not the how.\n\nCritics might gather around da Vinci's Mona Lisa, speaking of light and shadow, the stories held within each brushstroke, yet at the heart of it lies an enigma unsolved, a whisper of something beyond words. When one speaks of a cherished tale or a painting that stirs the soul, the explanation often begins with that elusive phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" before reason takes its ponderous course. The essence of art and morality slips through the fingers of analysis, leaving behind a residue of the infinite. As O'Connor so rightly put it, a story is the vessel for what cannot be simply stated, a bridge to the unsayable. The spirit of a tale lingers beyond its telling, just as ethics speaks in silence, transcending the bounds of language. As Wittgenstein mused, ethics dwells in the realm of the transcendental, echoing the same ineffable quality that art possesses.\n\nIn the realm of the unseen, where the noumenal lies, as Kant might have described, is where art and morality resonate most deeply within us. These are felt rather than explained, touching us in places where words falter. Literature, with its woven tapestry of words, stands apart, carrying the weight of moral truths like no other art. It is here where the threads of life and story intertwine, where the values lived and the values written are one and the same. In literature's embrace, we find reflections of ourselves, the truths we hold and the truths we seek, as crucial to our being as the air we breathe or the paths we tread.",
            "In the days long past, before the world was as it is now, there lay a land called Germania. A place neither bound by a single name nor a single tale. It stretched out from the cold Baltic shores down through the dark forests and rising alps, a land of shadows and quiet might. From München's alpine watch to Kiel's windswept edge, a whisper of its culture lingered, a tapestry woven from countless threads. The Rhine bore witness to Köln, and the Elbe cradled Dresden, each city a note in a long-forgotten song. A nation united now from the remnants of many tribes and peoples.\n\nThe scholars and historians debate still from whence the name Germania was born. Some speak of Tacitus, who named the Tungrians as the first of the Germans, those who once stood against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his writings of conquest, called them “Germanus,” a name borrowed from the very Gauls he subjugated, a mark to distinguish the unconquered from the conquered. The records tell of battles fought across the Rhine, of skirmishes and wars waged by those fierce tribes. A name whose root is tangled in language, perhaps from the spears they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout echoing in the din of war.\n\nIt was Tacitus who penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in the year of our Lord 98, writing of the Germans, those who seemed to him untouched by the mingling of races. He spoke of them as aboriginal, their land a wild and inhospitable place, where skies wept cold and manners were sullen. Who would forsake the warmth of Africa or Asia for such a realm unless it was their own? \n\nAnd yet, the Romans did not abandon their empire for Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking out its riches and its men to serve under the eagle's standard. The tribes lived on the empire's edge, trading their wares and their strength, a borderland where cultures met and mingled, but seldom mixed. The Romans ventured forth, but always returned, leaving Germania as it was, a land of mystery and might.",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its web, a tool of deception stretching long and thin, but in the end, the masquerade must be cast off. For a soul risks losing its own reflection should it cling too tightly to the mask. Yet, to unravel such deceit is to chance a solitude, the self set adrift from the harbor of kinship. One must choose then, between the preservation of the self or the tethered bonds of those around. For there are those who might shrug off the trickery with indifference, while others might feel the sting of betrayal, the charade a bitter pill.\n\nWhen the cloak of disguise wraps itself around the guise of gender, it stirs questions deep as the night, questions of why one would bury their true self beneath another’s skin. Viola, adrift in a foreign land, dons the garb of a man, a shield against the unknown: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse spares her but at a cost, severing her from the sisterhood of women, a lifeline cut short. Her deception is so complete that Olivia, bewildered, sees her as Sebastian and love’s folly ensues: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, beneath the surface, there stirs a forbidden longing with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nIn the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tapestry of hidden truths, whereby deception lays bare the desires buried deep, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The play whispers of unspoken longings, brought forth by the presence of Viola under the guise of Cesario. Does Olivia's heart truly leap for Cesario's male facade, or does it harbor a secret yearning for women? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia serves as Shakespeare's jest, a mirror of those who judge by appearance alone. Her swift affections, turned from Cesario to Sebastian, reveal a heart easily swayed, her regard for Cesario/Viola shifting to sisterly kinship: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the vast expanse of history, there are shadows cast by empires long fallen, and among them, the German colonial rule stands stark in its memory of harshness. In the arid lands of South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the echoes of genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people speak of a brutality unmasked. Yet, to paint the entire German colonial endeavor with a single brush is a folly of simplification. The empire, sprawling across distant lands, mirrored the complexity of its geography in its disparate policies and governance. \n\nWhen the British seized control of German East Africa in the year 1919, they unearthed a landscape rich with educated souls. In the classrooms of Tanganyika, minds had been nurtured under a German sky. Kamerun, too, bore witness to scholarly praise, the efforts of the educators resonating through time. \n\nBut South West Africa told a different tale. There, beneath the relentless sun, the education of the native was largely a mission of faith, entrusted to the hands of missionaries with scant support from the governing hands. The settlers' children, the European progeny, found favor in the eyes of the state. Schools were built, resources poured, and the holy mission of education was regulated and funded. Yet, the native children remained shadows in their own land, untouched by the light of knowledge, wandering in the dark of ignorance.\n\nThe soil of South West Africa bore the scars of decisions made long before. While other colonies could count their learned, in these lands, the silence of illiteracy reigned. The reasons for this stark divergence are writ in the annals of social and political forces, the attitudes of settlers and rulers alike shaping a destiny. This tale seeks to unearth those buried truths, to sift through the sands of time and bring forth understanding.\n\nIn the dusty tomes of history, the story of German colonial education unfolds, penned in the language of its origin. Scholars of a bygone era sought to chronicle the systems of learning that spanned the empire. Later voices, speaking in the English tongue, broadened the discourse, laying bare the contrasts between these far-flung territories. Among them, Cohen's words stand prominent, comparing the schools of South West Africa to those of East Africa, unraveling the threads that weave their differences. Cohen speaks of the settlers, their numbers a force that shaped the educational path of South West Africa.\n\nBeneath the German sun, South West Africa offered a climate more forgiving than its brethren lands, yet its heart was a desert, unforgiving and vast. By 1913, the white settlers numbered nearly 15,000, their presence a testament to the land's relative hospitality. In East Africa, the numbers dwindled, a mere 5,336 calling it home, the next largest contingent in the empire's fold.\n\nThus, in the corridors of history, the tale of German colonial education in South West Africa unfolds, a tapestry of contrasts and complexities, echoing through the ages.",
            "There was a time when the United States and Mexico stood as adversaries, their rivalry stretching over the long span of fifty-seven years, from the year 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by strife, a time when the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848 reached its fevered pitch. The United States, in its relentless pursuit, laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the grip of Mexico. The clashes between these nations were many, a tide that waned only with the approach of the First World War. At the heart of this conflict lay a chasm of differences—religion, culture, tradition—each a stone in the edifice of their discord, each a source of material strife.\n\nThis tale of two nations is not unlike the tales of others, nations bound by borders and bound by the rivalries those borders breed. For where lines are drawn upon the earth, so too are lines drawn in the hearts of men. David M. Pletcher speaks of this, saying that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems,\" for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the United States, while others in the Latin expanse have found a different fate.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, cast its shadow between the two nations, a rift that has long haunted the annals of history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in the days of old, Americans stood opposed not to fascism or communism, but to Catholicism and monarchy. It was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War's contest of wills, but here the struggle was rooted in the soul, in the beliefs that each nation held dear. This distrust was not born anew but inherited from the colonial past, a legacy of the English and the Spanish, a barrier to the peace that might have been.\n\nDiehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes within that span of rivalry, disputes that echo the cries of border raids and frontier upheavals. Bandits and outlaws, marauders of the border towns, were a scourge until at last, the United States and Mexico took up arms to secure their borders. Yet with time, the rivalry waned, as Schmitt observes, for Mexico grew reliant on the United States, and the ambitions of America turned away from conquest of land to the allure of economic entanglements in Mexican soil.\n\nAnd so the tale of rivalry softened, the years of strife yielding to a new era, an era where the shadows of the past lingered still but no longer cast their darkest pall.",
            "Fifteen years past and the world had turned brittle beneath me, taken by an illness unknown, a shadow without form or name. I was a nurse then, a choice born from a hunger for the safety I’d never known in childhood. The words were a chant in my youth: you’ll always find work; folks will always fall ill. So it was I walked a path not my own, my dreams of science and stories left to wither, tending instead to the sick and the weary.\n\nYet there I stood, forty-six years gone, alone, the coffers empty, no work to grasp. The years unfurled, living on the mercy of Social Security, each day a struggle against the dark tide gnawing at my soul. Certainty had fled, but truth remained—without family and a few steadfast friends, I’d not have endured. Disaster, when it comes, strips strength to the bone and leaves you hollow.\n\nLife’s course is fraught with storms, some small, others sweeping. No promise holds forever, and though we prepare, some burdens are too great to bear alone. We in this land of ours must turn from the crumbling promise of government’s hand, moldy and frayed, and find in each other the strength we crave. Trust must be reborn, a hand offered in both giving and accepting aid, not each of us alone behind walls of stone.\n\nThe rugged spirit they speak of, that built this place, was not borne of solitude but rather the thread of compassion and shared toil. Those who crossed the Rockies did not find the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo gather your provisions, as I have mine—kits for disaster, supplies for healing, water to be made clean, and windows to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their power, candles and matches to light the darkness, stores of food to ward off hunger’s call. If land is yours to till, let it yield sustenance. A wood stove stands ready for those not bound by city walls.\n\nYet amid your preparations, do not forget the faces around you. Reach out, learn the names of those who dwell beside you.",
            "In a time long past, in the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince came into the world, destined to be known as Buddha. A man who would cast away the trappings of his princely life to walk the path of enlightenment. His teachings, like seeds scattered in the wind, took root and grew into what is now called Buddhism. Among its branches, the oldest and most unyielding is Theravada Buddhism. This faith, stretching back some twenty-five hundred years, has shifted and morphed through the ages, its visage now different from when the Buddha himself walked the earth. These changes are apparent everywhere, in places like Sri Lanka, where the waters are cut by ceremony each year. Monks and lay folk both partake in this rite, which holds a weight of belief despite never being spoken of by the Buddha himself. Such transformations ripple from surface rituals to the very essence of the faith's doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist fold, both those who don the robes and those who do not, have seen their guiding principles change, swayed by tides both internal and external, both harsh and gentle.\n\nTo speak of these shifts, one must grasp the terms of the discourse. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhasasana's own ranks, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, by contrast, hail from those outside the Buddhist fold. Those forces that bear hostility seek to tear at the fabric of Buddhism, born from eyes that regard it with malice. Yet there are also forces indifferent, benign, which neither wish harm nor aid, though they may do one or the other inadvertently. These terms will weave through our tale like threads in a tapestry.\n\nWe must first turn our eyes to the heart of the faith—the doctrines at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Believers seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma finds its voice in the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka cradles the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the laws that bind, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical depths. Here lie notions of Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the ever-present suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara’s end, so too shall end the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out rules for life. For the common folk, there are five precepts: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from theft, from sexual misconduct, and from intoxicants. For those who wear the saffron robes, the rules multiply. At the faith’s foundation lie the four noble truths. First, the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the suffering that life brings. Second, the realization that attachment is the root of suffering. Third, the belief that suffering can indeed be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed precincts of any bargaining table, culture looms large, a specter both known and unknown, defined as much by absence as by presence. It is no monolith nor singularity, but a tapestry woven with contradictions and myriad hues. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to grasp at straws, to paint with such broad strokes that the canvas remains blank. A negotiator's true task lies in discerning the heart of the matter, the pulse of the culture that sits across from him, its rhythms and its truths, and how these will dance in the conversation between them. As one steps into the realm of another culture, it is seen through the prism of one's own, and inevitably, mirrors are held up to each other.\n\nTo fathom the depths of a foreign mind is to wander through its past, to acknowledge its biases without censure or change, to meet it where it stands, especially when one's own footing is less sure. When the ground beneath is unfamiliar, respect for the sacred rites and beliefs of others becomes an ally, bridging the chasm of misunderstanding and pushing the discourse forward.\n\nYet culture is not confined to the boundaries of nations. Within the borders of a single land, companies cultivate their own ethos. Some value the grinding tick of the office clock, others the gentle flow of time unbound. Such cultures reveal themselves in the garb of their people, in words spoken plainly or cloaked, in the division of tasks and the paths to upward mobility. Philanthropy may be encouraged at every level or funneled solely through sanctioned channels. Look to America and see the mosaic of corporate cultures, each distinct, even as they share the same soil. A harmony of exteriors may belie deeper intricacies, calling for a more profound exploration.\n\nValues, the bedrock of culture, whisper the reasons behind actions. Where honor and collective peace are cherished, a negotiator will not sully another's name to gain an edge. In cultures where a hard bargain holds sway, the rush to settle may not be felt. These truths must be understood long before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, to truly negotiate, to find common ground, one must look beyond the general to the individual, to see the person behind the culture.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So it is written in the Psalms, the ancient words echoing through the halls of time. Anselm took these words to heart, weaving them into the tapestry of his argument for the existence of the Almighty. In this reflection of the divine, Aquinas too found his voice, their twin songs rising in defense of a singular truth. But to weigh the merit of their claims, one must first assume the existence of this God they both champion, for their arguments are bound to a vision of the divine that brooks no rival. \n\nAnselm's path is one of inward turning, seeking the divine spark within. His argument is a journey of the soul, a reaching for understanding through the lens of faith. He speaks of God as a presence in the mind, a truth that cannot be unthought. The proof, he says, is within, in the silent spaces of the heart where God already dwells. It is a knowing, an acceptance of that which defies the grasp of reason, a trust in unseen certainties. This faith, they say, is the evidence of things not seen.\n\nAquinas walks a different road. His is the path of reason, of logic and the empirical. He offers five arguments, each a stone on the path to God: change and causation, contingency and degrees of excellence, and finally, the harmony of the world. In these, he finds necessity, a puzzle whose missing piece is God. He would have us believe through reason alone, a logic that needs no leap of faith. To see the world is to see the hand that crafts it. \n\nAnd so they stand, Anselm and Aquinas, each with their proofs, each with their truths. Yet neither holds the whole, for the divine is a mystery beyond the grasp of mortal minds. What they offer are glimpses, shadows on the wall of the cave. The heart knows what the mind cannot hold, and in that knowing, there is God.",
            "The way of words is a curious thing, how they lay upon the page like shadows cast by some unseen light. Authors weave them with intent, hoping to stir in the hearts of readers a certain notion or sentiment. Some weave better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he knew well the art of this weaving in his tale of The Great Gatsby. He took to pairing words that would not naturally find themselves together, shaping an atmosphere around his characters and their world. And then there were the colors, symbols imbued with meaning, each a thread in the tapestry he wove. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink. In Gatsby, Fitzgerald gave these colors life, a breath of significance that lingered long after the page was turned.\n\nWhite and gray, they spoke of sameness, of things worn and faded, white a little more refined, gray a little more weary. Fitzgerald set these colors to work from the start, painting his world in their hues. Daisy and Jordan, perpetually draped in white—like specters of privilege. All around, white was the color of choice: Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gaudy gala, Tom in his white shirt when he sought out Myrtle, even Catherine powdered in a milky white. The absence of white, the splash of primary colors at Gatsby's party, was a jarring thing. Common things were painted white or gray: the white chasms of New York, the gray names of Gatsby's revelers, Catherine’s apartment a slice of white cake in a city of sameness. Plain folk and places were painted thus: Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray stretch of cars and land in the valley of ashes, the Italian child a shade of gray, the dog-seller an old gray man.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald had laid out these colors, he used them to mark the mundane, the unremarkable. Daisy, in her white dress and her little white roadster, became less a person and more a thing, a piece of Gatsby's longing, an object of desire. Time and again, Daisy is shrouded in white, her presence diminished to a mere uniformity—her fur collar a gray haze, her dress white as Tom and Gatsby clash over her. Fitzgerald, in his way, used colors to strip away the layers of his characters until the truth lay bare.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the earth gives itself over to growth, the land spreads out beneath the mild sky, a cradle of bounty. This place where tomatoes and citrus take root, where leafy greens unfurl and the peppers hang like jewels upon the vine. Here, the land is a testament to what the sun and soil can conjure. Peaches and lemons, berries, and honey, all drawn from the earth's grasp. There is a hunger for what grows without the taint of man’s artifice, a market for the organic fruits of the earth, and in San Diego, it is a desire not easily sated. Here, the eggs and the milk bear the mark of nature's hand, and the farms open their gates, inviting the curious to walk the paths between the rows. The landowner finds in these endeavors a chance to align with programs that promise both sustenance and sanctuary, to marry profit with preservation.\n\nYet, the road of organic farming is not without its trials. The absence of chemicals demands a greater toil, a vigilance against the encroachment of pests and weeds. The soil must be nourished from the hands of those who tend it, forgoing the ease of modern alchemy. Such labor is a costly endeavor, and the small farms lack the vastness of their industrial kin. To maintain the wild among the cultivated, to plant cover crops, to guide the grazing herd, to root out the invasive, these too demand a toll. The landowner, in seeking to blend the wild with the till, may look to those with knowledge or means to ease the burden while enriching the land.\n\nThe chosen ground lies near Potrero, a tract of chaparral and oak, of grassland that whispers in the wind beside the Cleveland National Forest. Here, in the ecoregion of the Southern Foothills, a plan takes shape, a conservation of the many species whose fates hang in balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the gnatcatcher, all woven into the fabric of this place, some clinging to the edge of memory.\n\nLong before, this land bore the footprints of those who knew it first, the Native Americans, and then those who came with cattle and saws in the age of iron and steam. A homestead it was, where beasts grazed and timber fell to the ax. I took this parcel from the lists of property, seeking what the land might offer to those who wish to farm and to preserve. To find what the earth might give and what might be given back, I looked to the nearby farm that thrives on the same soil.",
            "There is a tether between brothers, a cord that binds and holds, unyielding and eternal. Within this tether lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than any soul who stands outside their shared blood, and they see themselves mirrored in each other's eyes. It is when the world presses hardest upon them that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, be it for good or ill. When these emotions rise to the surface, they come at a cost. To grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the consequences they bring. When one meets a brother's gaze and sees within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as the world sees them but as they truly are. It is in their deeds and the consequences of those deeds that their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, and with them walk the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Across a lush, vividly described landscape, they embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in a scene of finality, and only one brother emerges from its shadow. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the swirling complexities within the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.  \nThe protagonist's deeds are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he first steps out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated venture, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother to teach worldly skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high fork of the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams were shattered, for Doodle was born with a heart frail as tissue, making his survival unlikely. Even if he lived, the prospect of vigorous physical feats was a distant dream. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, his head brimming with wild fantasies, to have them dashed in a heartbeat. Indeed, he even bears a dark anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating smothering him with a pillow. What child considers such a dire act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him. Such a simple gesture fills the protagonist with hope, revealing that his conviction was weak. Deep within, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the vast wilderness of the mind where shadows flicker and the unknown looms, the human brain stands as a labyrinthine creation, a masterwork of complexity and invention. From the dawn of time to the age of steel and circuits, the images we draw to make sense of it have shifted, from waxen slabs to parchment, from the written word to the cold logic of machines. Yet, as you wander these cerebral paths, beware the mirage of these metaphors, for they can mislead and obscure the truth.\n\nThe journey of understanding begins with the senses, those ancient messengers that transmute the raw elements of the world—touch, warmth, the tremble of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind. A symphony of signals, shaped and reshaped by the brain's arcane algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processes. Consider the simplicity of a black box on a field of white; the bottom-up gaze discerns the lines and hues, the edges where shadow meets light, whispering to you of its form. Meanwhile, the top-down mind, wise with the knowledge of what has come before, hastens recognition, turning mere perception into understanding—a black box, not a void in the white expanse.\n\nYet, amid this torrent of perception, there stands the sentinel of attention, a guardian that chooses which whispers of thought are worthy of the mind's gaze. You look down and see not each blade of grass beneath your feet, though they are there, silently processed. But in the clamor of voices, your name, like a bright flame, calls to you above the din. Through layers of thought, this guardian of focus shapes what is seen and known.\n\nTo hold the world's knowledge within the mind, it must first be caught and kept. Memory, with its many faces—fleeting, like the sensory; momentary, like the working; enduring, like the long-term—begins with the act of encoding. Each sensation is captured in its own fashion; the spoken word is a tapestry of form and sound and meaning. Once captured, it must be held. In the fleeting moments of working memory, the spark of thought loops through its neural path, a brief echo of electricity. In the depths of long-term memory, it is woven into the very fabric of proteins, a tapestry of existence.\n\nIn the endeavor to map this realm, many models arise, each a reflection of humanity's quest for understanding. Some draw from the echoes of recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the pulse of the living brain. The semantic network, a web of concepts and connections, tells of \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" and from \"table,\" the leap to \"wooden,\" a lattice of thought across the vastness of the mind.",
            "In the year two thousand and seven, the United States found itself swallowed by a financial abyss, the likes of which it had not seen in many years. Unemployment rose like a specter, the housing market collapsed under its own weight, and the mighty pillars of American industry lay shattered. This recession grips the nation even now, demanding we ask how such ruin came to pass and how it might be averted. At the heart of it all lay the self-serving and short-sighted machinations of those in power, who pressed upon banks and firms the issuance of sub-prime loans within a frail financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pressed to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into complex instruments. When the borrowers faltered, the banks lacked the reserves to withstand the storm, and the chaos spread like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the waning days of the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure his legacy with a second term. In a bid to bolster his standing, the administration loosened lending constraints, laying bare the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfold years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the gathering storm in 1999, noting the mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to extend mortgage loans to those of modest means, even as stockholders demanded ever-greater profits. Holmes predicted the outcome of such folly: that in lean times, these government-backed entities might find themselves in dire straits, much like the savings and loan crisis of the eighties. As foretold, reckless lending led inexorably to economic calamity.\n\nThe unraveling was hastened by the tangled web of new mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations drew more sectors of the economy into the housing market's orbit. Families and financial markets alike found themselves overextended, precariously poised on the housing bubble's fragile skin.\n\nAnd burst it did, with devastating consequence. Financial titans that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves ensnared. The top investment banks recorded staggering debts, their combined mortgage obligations reaching four point one trillion dollars, a full thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers dismembered, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley forced into the embrace of commercial banking, subject to stringent oversight. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with five trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the government's aegis in September of 2008.",
            "In the quiet of a room where the light falls faint and the air is thick with the thoughts of a writer, there lies the temptation of exposition. A place where the words take form and the stories unfold, yet it is a double-edged sword. For some, it is a flight of prose, magical and captivating; for others, it is the lull that sends a reader adrift, their fingers hovering over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name. Dr. Merlin knows this too well, her voice rising in protest when the weight of too much information bears down, strangling the narrative.\n\nThe truth is, exposition is a fickle companion.\n\nReaders, wise and seasoned, know the adage: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, the lure of lengthy passages pulls even the best into its grip, where stories derail or drown in abundance. Exposition whispers in a writer's ear, urging them to lay bare the history, to rush through the mundane, to reach the heart of the tale. It is not unlike the fiend upon the shoulder, coaxing the author to divulge every trivial detail of each character's past.\n\nBut exposition is the telling of tales, the recounting of events in words that are too plain. In film, it is the monologue, the character laying out the tale like an ancient mariner's lament. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who speaks.\n\nSuppose you read of a heroine who met her beloved at a certain time, in a certain place; they were wed in grandeur, and her husband's life was snuffed out before her eyes. Would you expect this tale to be spun in a mere two pages, their voices scarcely heard? Surely not. An author must delve into the husband's soul, his words and deeds a testament to his love, while the heroine, in her own way, reflects the change and richness he brought to her life. When she mourns, you mourn with her; her grief becomes yours, drawing you closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, the tale demands more than the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nWriters must breathe life into the narrative, even when the urge to gloss over details beckons. Perhaps there is a new character, a man whose past is a tapestry of Air Force days, a gas station night manager's life, two marriages left behind, childless, with dreams of owning the station and a penchant for fishing. Once, he had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "The dawn broke over Columbus, Ohio, and the first murmurings of the day came through the flickering screen, the news of the world carried forth by NBC 4. There was a man, his name Shad Hostettler, from Ashley, Ohio, who had turned the blade upon his own. His wife's name left unsaid, as if her silence was her own testament. They showed his likeness, a visage of malice, the eyes of a man who knew too well the darkness within. The tale was brief, a scant two minutes of time, a story still unfolding, yet it was enough. Enough for the world to know of the evil that walked among them.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen years, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods, the morning's shadow upon him. No names save his own, no arrests, no suspects in the wind. The SWAT team prowling the scene like hounds in the night, their search fruitless as yet. The tale told quick and gone, the brevity of it a whisper of the world’s indifference, for he was a black man in a black neighborhood. A truth as old as time, that the world turns slower for those of darkness, a truth that cuts deeper than any blade.\n\nThere was a gunshot, a bullet that found its mark in the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber reminder of the world’s capriciousness. They spoke of where it might have happened, Crime-Stoppers offering riches for the name of the one who pulled the trigger. Five thousand pieces of silver for justice.\n\nThe skies were to weep come afternoon, the storms a promise of the day, the temperatures to cling to the low eighties, a respite of sorts. The weatherman’s voice a siren’s call to keep watching, to stay tuned for the storm to break.\n\nAnd then a robbery on Clime Road, a man cloaked in darkness, a hoodie drawn against the world. They spoke of him, his skin dark as the night, his height and weight a litany of his form, the words lingering longer than they ought, as if his color was the crime itself.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name spoken with disdain, a drug kingpin from Texas, his empire of marijuana stretching to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, 300 months, the years wrapped in numbers that seemed to stretch further than the truth. Hispanic, they said, a man marked by his heritage, though it mattered not. The world cares little for such things when it casts its judgment.\n\nAnd so the stories were told, the tales of the day laid bare, the world turning still, indifferent to the lives it held in its grasp.",
            "In the realm of financial instruments, the ETF stands like a lone sentinel upon the plains. An exchange traded fund, it is, crafted to mirror the ebb and flow of an index, a commodity, or perhaps a basket of assets akin to an index fund, yet possessed of a singular flexibility, for it moves upon the exchange as a stock might. The ETF offers the broad sweep of diversification found in an index, yet retains the singular charm of stock ownership, granting the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold in one's hand as few as a single share. Though these attributes glisten with the allure of promise, their expense ratios remain modest, far beneath the weight of the common mutual fund. Yet, not all is without cost, for a commission is the toll exacted upon any trade, as if one were dealing in the stocks of old. \n\nThe breadth of ETFs is wide, a tapestry of funds unfurled across the market. And in this, the savvy traveler in the world of finance must ever question, must ever seek if the proclaimed benefits, such as diversification, stand true in the harsh light of scrutiny, and to what extent they hold. Our endeavor here is to examine the ETF known as IHF, to lay it against those top ten holdings that form its backbone, to weigh if the single ETF stands in the light cast by a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks, and if there be configurations yet untried that might yield an optimal balance, a sharper return.\n\nIn this undertaking, the burden of examining each holding in its entirety would be a cumbersome beast indeed. Thus, we consider only the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below lie the top 10 holdings, each a piece of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these ten stocks serve as the face of the ETF IHF, we may turn to the current % of assets, brought to a unity of 100%, and from this, derive the contributions of each stock to the Beta and Return of a portfolio composed solely of these ten, each in the measure the ETF has ordained through its holdings. The calculus of Beta and return is laid bare in the chart below.\n\nFrom the figures, one sees clearly that a portfolio with but the top ten holdings boasts a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in returns. It is also clear that the Beta of these ten is .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. The findings thus suggest that a portfolio trimmed to these ten holdings might yield a greater return with diminished Beta. Yet, there remains the whisper of doubt, the question if the means of these two portfolios stand apart, truly distinct from one another.\n\nTo probe this matter, to discern if these portfolios are as different as they seem, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock among the top ten, each brought to the same measure of 100%, to compare their collective standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the cold breath of winter, the numbers fell away like leaves from a dying tree. A campus in New England, the air biting and cruel, saw the logs of commuters dwindle in the third month, a sharp decline that seemed to echo the silent halls and empty paths where once footsteps trod. December, the month where the world turns inward, brought with it final flurries of schoolwork, grades, and the weight of a year closing. The days slipped away, and with them the memory of the commuter log, lost amidst the rush and the hush of the holiday's onset. A break, a pause in the cycle, where the students and faculty vanished into the month-long void, leaving the campus hushed in their absence. \n\nThe spring would come, as it always does, late in January, when the world begins to thaw and life resumes its relentless march. Yet, February lay like a shadow, unexplained in its emptiness, a mystery of missing numbers. Perhaps it was the nature of things, the way a fire burns brightest at the start and then fades to embers, that saw this project wane. In March, there came a reckoning, a challenge to stir the ashes—Carpool Challenge Week—a desperate bid to breathe life once more into what had nearly faded. And indeed, the logs rose again, a testament to the struggle against the inevitable, against the ebb of engagement and the fickle nature of interest.\n\nYet there lay another struggle in this, one that ran deeper than mere numbers. The road calls with its freedom, its independence, the car a symbol of autonomy deeply rooted in the soul of the people. To tempt them away, to lure them to another path, required more than mere entreaties. Prizes were offered, tokens of encouragement: gift certificates, small treasures for local indulgences. But what if there had been more? A bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car—a dream to chase, a spark to ignite the drifting interest. The prizes remained static, unchanged through the journey, but had they grown, had they offered more, perhaps the tide would have turned in December, perhaps January would not have felt so desolate. The thought lingers, the what-ifs dance in the shadows, and one can only wonder what might have been.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon a collection of early Edison films, a trove of moving pictures that seemed to whisper of a time long vanished. Among them, the trick films held my attention, fifteen in number, spanning the years 1895 to 1901. These were not merely films but illusions spun from the loom of creative editing, each frame a sleight of hand. My study lingered there, tracing the poetic form of these cinematic conjurings, noting the divergences that marked the later reels with a kind of evolutionary boldness. At the turn of the century, the trick film sat bound within its stage, framed by the stoic proscenium, the camera still as stone, capturing the world in long and medium shots, adhering to the creed of one shot equating to one film. Yet, some dared to defy this rigid doctrine, weaving in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nThe films were held in a shared embrace by their setting—a fixed interior, a proscenium view that rooted its essence in the theater, in the flickering world of vaudeville and magic shows. The camera, a sentinel in its place, did not stir to follow the dance of figures or objects. This immobility was a hallmark of the age, a tether to the theater's past, where the stage was the world entire. In these frames, the actors moved only side to side, a lateral ballet with no voyage toward the lens. Take, for instance, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the performers entered from the right, tracing their paths along a horizontal script. Even as they slipped beyond the frame's edge, the camera remained steadfast.\n\nThe proscenium's gaze favored the long shot, occasionally bending to a medium, but never closer, never a whisper of the close-up. This was the theater's doing, a tradition where the audience beheld the whole, framed by the stage's borders. The actors, anchored in the middle ground, ventured no nearer, and so the close-up remained a stranger.\n\nIn the main, these early trick films played by the rule that one envisioned shot equaled a film, confining their stories to a minute's breath, shaped by the frames per second. This brevity curtailed the narrative ambition, the films becoming more akin to vaudeville's quick tricks—magic, vanishments, transformations—brief spectacles without a tale to tell. Yet, the notion of one shot in the viewer's eye was but an illusion; a single \"shot\" could be a tapestry of many, stitched together to conjure apparitions or make bodies vanish. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), among the first of its kind. To the viewer, it seemed a seamless vision, but look closely and see where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" takes its cue, a revelation in the guise of a singular shot.",
            "In the old bones of the Gothic Novel lies a contradiction, an oxymoron of 'Old-New' as Ian Watt lays bare in his exploration of this literary breed. This Gothic form, both scorned and revered, accused of shallowness and celebrated for its terrible grandeur, took its first breath in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Here was a weaving of the ancient with the so-called modern, a birthing of the proto-Gothic that forged a new tongue for telling tales. Walpole drew from the ancient stage, from the mimicry of the world in 'modern' narratives, to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre stood draped in echoes of medieval stagecraft, of towering architecture, of old ways and rites. Even as The Castle of Otranto saw the light, 'gothic' was a word worn by many styles and eras, seen as relic or crude in the face of modern strides in society and letters. Yet in that meeting of theatrical Gothic with the new novel's form, where characters' minds lay bare to the reader, the Gothic endured, living and dying anew to readers far from its genesis.\n\nOne theme that wound tight through Gothic novels was chivalry. That medieval code, the shaping of a knight, found both echo and change in The Castle of Otranto. To those Gothic scribes, chivalry was a beacon, a symbol of brave and noble knights, a dream lost in the mire of their own times. Through chivalry's lens, the Gothic past became a golden age, a romantic ideal to mend the present. Walpole, caught in the storm of politics and shadowed by claims of injustice, perhaps saw in the Gothic age a purity lost to his own. This thought took shape in his characters, like Frederic, who bore the chivalric mantle. Before Frederic steps from the page, he is painted with the strokes of a bygone knight, a prince, scarred by tragedy, thought slain by infidels. This \"gallant and courteous Knight\" stands larger than life, a figure drawn in excess, a harbinger of the Gothic's future form.",
            "In the ghostly corridors of commerce, where shadows of goods traverse the earth from the whispered wants of the customer through the raw sinews of creation, there lies the tale of supply chain management. Born in the year of nineteen hundred and eighty-two at the hands of Keith Oliver, a soul given to consulting, this tale speaks of the orchestration of needs and wills, of time and place, all to sate the hunger of the market with a cold efficiency. Six are the pillars that hold this spectral edifice aloft: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is upon these that the managers of business lay their weary hands to summon forth service to their kin, the customer.\n\nProduction, the first whisper in this chain of shadows, is the bedrock upon which all else is built. It is the questioner, asking when and where, why and how all must be wrought from the earth. The manager, a seer of sorts, peers into the market, that great oracle, to divine the desires of the masses. Once the runes of demand are cast and the market's heart revealed, decisions are made as to what shall be brought into the light and in what number. The where of it, the place of birthing, is chosen with care, the plant that shall nurture the goods to meet the demands and desires of the world. With place decided, the burdens of scheduling and the maintenance of the great machines fall upon the manager's shoulders. Each detail must be a thread in the tapestry, lest the whole unravel and precious time and gold be lost to the winds.\n\nIn the days when I labored under the roofs of Wal-Mart and Target, I saw these designs, these books of process, each a scripture of order from the garments worn by the worker to the rhythm of trucks arriving with their burdens. Such outlines bring a clarity where confusion might otherwise reign, a map through the labyrinth of commerce.\n\nThe second pillar of this shadowed realm is supply. Here lies the strategy, the decisions that shape the very bones of a facility, the alliances forged with other hands to strengthen the weave. A product may have many faces and many homes, each division with its own tools and craftsmen. It falls upon the manager to discern the best path, the best division for each task, or to seek the hands of others beyond their walls. It is velocity they seek, that swift dance of quality and adaptability, all while keeping the wolf of cost at bay.\n\nThus is the tale of supply chain management told, a tapestry of decisions and designs, where each move echoes through the halls of commerce, forever shaping the shadows upon the land.",
            "In the vast tapestry of Victorian literature, the threads of detail and aristocratic focus weave a common pattern. Yet, in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the weave frays and twists into something other. Here lies mystery, a penchant for the bizarre, a departure from the expected that breathes depth into their characters, revealing souls laid bare by the winds of their peculiar worlds.\n\nIn the shadows of Oliver Twist, there lingers a passage where bewilderment reigns. \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nSuch dreams and waking nightmares cloak Oliver Twist in a shroud of enigma, revealing the boy's heartaches and the shadows that lurk around him. As Oliver revisits the moment of his shooting, reality bends to dreams, and in that bending, a truth emerges. The world around him, a maelstrom in which he is but a leaf, carries him without his will. The hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit echo through the fog of his mind, and the pain of his wound becomes a constant, a companion in fear rather than surprise. The question of whose hand guides this fate rises like smoke, for it is not Oliver's own. This incident is a testament to his powerlessness, his inability to wrest control from the grip of fate, even when life hangs by a thread. A whisper of defeat creeps into the narrative, the shadow of Fagin's influence casts long over the boy, carving acceptance from despair, dulling his will to fight. Else he might have struggled, if for nothing more than survival.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\n\nIn these pages, the day and night are as phantoms, slipping through the fingers, leaving the characters adrift in their wake. Such is the nature of this Victorian mystery, a departure into the unknown, where the heart is laid bare, and the soul finds its voice in the shadows of its time.",
            "In the years gone by, I found myself bound in the duty of guiding young minds in the hours after school had ended. Small souls gathered there, each wrestling with their own particular trials in the realm of letters and numbers, but it was the written word where I found my own strength lay. There was a boy, Adrian, a lad no older than ten who found himself at odds with the act of reading. The letters on the page confounded him, some he pronounced as if they were old friends, others as though they were strangers he had never met. He was a child of Latino heritage, yet his English rolled off the tongue as naturally as if he were born to it. We stumbled through the morass of incomprehension until the day I crossed paths with his mother. She came like a shadow into the small room where I lingered with a few stragglers, my charges for the afternoon. The woman spoke only in her native Spanish, a tongue I knew but little of, yet we managed to bridge the chasm of language between us. It was then that the truth revealed itself with the weight of certainty: Adrian could read, but the English script was an unfamiliar terrain to him. Whether this revelation served to aid him I cannot say, but the hope remains that he finds himself on surer ground now.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the chasm that exists in the schools, particularly in a place such as California, where tongues are as varied as the colors of the sky at dusk. It is a reminder that the struggle with language is often hidden beneath the surface, that even a child whose speech flows with ease may find the written word a formidable adversary. The question that arises is what course to chart from here? For Adrian, it was a matter of guiding him through the intricacies of English pronunciation and the alphabet. Yet for the multitude who scarcely know English, the journey is fraught with greater complexity. The answer is not singular or simple. The dual language system, immersion in the mainstream, private guides, classes for those learning English as a second tongue—none alone can surmount this barrier. The path lies in the weaving together of all these threads.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not only for those whose first breath was in Spanish but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" the words echoing like a prophecy. There is fear and whisperings that such endeavors squander resources, that the many will find no gain. But these are lies. Were we to embrace such methods as the rule and not the exception, all would reap the harvest. But how to proceed? Shall we decree that all who teach must speak in two tongues? No, that is a dream too far. Yet, what hinders us from bringing forth aides and tutors, those who walk in both worlds and can guide others across the divide?",
            "From the time we're young, they tell us there's something grander than us, something beyond the grasp of our understanding. Some go to Sunday school, others to Temple, and some dig deep within themselves for answers. Many of us take up the faiths handed down by our kin. Yet, there are those who turn their backs entirely, denying anything exists beyond their own narrow world. We might cling to one set of beliefs only to later cast them aside for another. Whatever path we tread, we're seeking to carve out a piece of who we are through our own spiritual lenses. We search for a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favored bird. We sat on the front porch, the rain beating a rhythm on the tin roof above, both of us with cigarettes in hand. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants lined up along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part lost in memory. He'd grown frail in those past months, his clothes hanging loose from his frame. His hair, too, had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. His eyes stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine. A loneliness settled in, a fear that kept words trapped inside, for speaking them might make it all too real. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in staring into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father left this world in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his pain but stretched his days past what the doctors had foreseen. What worth was there in suffering longer, I couldn't say. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I whispered no prayers. If God was there, I figured He'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to watch him slip from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear witness to the end of the life that gave me mine. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to bear witness to his end. I curled up in bed, buried myself there for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo call ever came.",
            "In the time when the land lay unburdened by the weight of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a sentinel of Republicanism, carved from the very soil he tilled. An agrarian by heart and trade, his brief foray into the realm of politics left a mark of resolute conviction on the pages of governance—a voice that rang clear in the defense of the individual's liberty and the rights of man against the encroaching tide of authority. His allegiance to the agrarian creed shaped his thoughts like the furrowed lines of the earth, bearing seeds that would sprout opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary, each one tethered to the notion of a pastoral ideal.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a canvas unmarked by the hands of tradition, a place where the architects of government could craft something pure and untamed—a self-governing Eden. He held firm to the belief in natural rights, those intrinsic to the human spirit, each one knotted to the other, a tapestry that would unravel if even one thread was pulled. Such rights, he declared, must remain beyond government's grasp, for in the untamed state of nature, it was the cunning and the strong who reaped the spoils. But in civilization, this must not be so.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor reckoned, a government must be wrought that embraces the dual nature of man—his capacity for both light and shadow. To him, the morals of government were but a reflection of man's own virtues and sins. He spoke of good principles, those that safeguarded the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and fended off the specter of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles could endure, he argued, even under the sway of self-interest, that perpetual engine of human endeavor, so long as it did not gnaw at the foundations of the common good to fatten itself upon others. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's innate darkness, ever watchful to prevent the taint of vile principles.\n\nIn chorus with his fellow Republicans, Taylor demanded a Constitution interpreted not loosely but with the precision of a craftsman's hand. He envisioned a Federal government circumscribed by the explicit words of that sacred text, wary of the expansive beast that might grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he warned of the perils in an interpretation devoid of the framers' intent, for such a path was fertile ground for corruption. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true testament of the Union, a covenant that spoke of a confederacy of sovereign states, not a singular nation bound by fetters unseen.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast down, the world narrowing to the scene before him, yet his mind remained a vast blank canvas. The gaze was steady, devoid of emotion, a practiced detachment that absorbed every detail without assigning meaning or context. Thoughts came and went, ephemeral whispers, barely settling before they vanished, leaving behind the purity of perception untainted by conscious reflection.\n\nOnce, an artist he knew had suggested a book, a tome called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, an offering that promised to unlock the mysteries of form and line. Since childhood, a desire to capture the world in graphite and charcoal had lingered within him. The book spoke of framing, of taking a world too intricate to grasp and reducing it to something manageable—a bowl of fruit, isolated from the chaos of kitchen and dining room.\n\nYet, as he stood, eyes fixed on the vessel before him, the mental frame eluded him. Overwhelmed, he could do nothing but stand in silent testament to the spectacle laid out. Like Picasso lost in blue or Monet awash in green, he stood on the cusp of an artistic revelation—his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers, delicate in their task, found the tool of his craft. Muscles tensed and released, guiding his hand in fluid arcs, a dancer's grace in the execution of necessity. The water churned, a crystalline ballet, carrying away fragments of the scene. Once more, his hand found the lever, a nervous urgency propelling the motion, but the obstinate form resisted, anchored to the porcelain depths.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted as if to weather a storm, the green tie a noose around his neck. A frown creased his brow as he regarded the offensive castoff, a message of sorts from those who frequented the Rite Aid restrooms, a testament to the labors of those who cleaned. After several attempts, each one a meditation on futility, his hand reached to the side, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it thickly around his fingers until it became a crude glove. \n\nHe straightened, then bent once more, the hand descending into the bowl with the slow inevitability of a ritual, like a pilgrim's hand reaching into fire for a sacred relic.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of consequence young lives are snuffed out behind the wheel. Factors converge in a grim symphony, a deadly vector for the freshest faces of American roads. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth that the adolescent mind is a realm unprepared for the dark ballet of driving. Inexperience lies coiled at the heart of it, a serpent in the garden, birthing not only fatal crashes but a litany of rollovers, reckless speed, and the inevitable veering from the road's edge. \n\nAmongst their peers they fare worse, as any soul with a mote of sense might reckon they would, wandering in packs as is their wont. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted the link between the age of those carried and the frequency of their misfortune on the asphalt. \n\nCalifornia and her sister states have tried to weave a net of safety, granting only provisional licenses that bind the hands of the young, setting limits on the hours they may roam and forbidding the carriage of other minors. Yet such measures are but stopgaps, mere patches on a yawn of an abyss. The youngest among us are, by every accounting of statistical markers, ill-equipped to wield the weight of such responsibility. \n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a psychologist who peers into the workings of the young mind, posits even eighteen years is too tender for a regular license to drive. In USA Today, Zuckerman’s research speaks of a common lust among those not yet nineteen or twenty, a hunger for the thrill of risk. It stands to reason then, that driving should be delayed, the itch of thrill-seeking allowed to wane. \n\nIf we persist in issuing licenses to these young fledglings, the roads will continue to drink deep of their blood, and the toll will rise to towering heights. By the year of 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will be of age to grip the wheel and a legion of new teen drivers will unfurl upon the highways. \n\nLegislation to address this is a simple enough affair. Let the schools keep to their classrooms, teaching the ways of the road, but let no one under eighteen command a vehicle. A provisional permit, yes, before a full license, and let there be a reckoning of hours spent learning the craft behind the wheel. The number of hours, a figure drawn from the states’ own books, like California with its six hours of direct training and fifty hours in the company of an adult. The grim ledger of teen driving stretches across this land, and thus a uniform national law seems a reasonable means, a shield to guard the youth from themselves. Such legislation is no new dawn, but perhaps it is a lantern in the dark.",
            "In the quiet reaches of the mind where sound is meant to find its way, there lies a disorder, a tangled skein of miscommunication. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it. Or Auditory Processing Disorder if you prefer your terms less ensnaring. It's a discord in the brain's symphony, where the central nervous system fails to harmonize the notes that wander in from the outside world. A condition not of the ear but of the understanding, where the music heard does not translate to the music felt.\n\nThe disorder's tale begins in the mid-century past, a time when children with voices trapped within sought release. They called it auditory imperception then, a name as cumbersome as the disorder itself. Italian minds—Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari—cast their nets wide over the mystery in 1954, and by '61, Kimura introduced a new lens, dichotic testing, a means to unravel the physiology of perception. The story unfolded further in '77, when minds gathered to press forward the understanding of children thus afflicted.\n\nIn its myriad manifestations, CAPD whispers confusion into the ear. A person may find themselves adrift in spaces where sounds drift aimlessly, unable to anchor their source. Discrimination is a task unfit for such ears, as the cacophony of the world layers itself indistinguishably. Patterns in sound become enigmatic, speech loses its tonal depth, sarcasm slips unnoticed beneath the waves of conversation. Sounds overlap, one masking the other, and the sequence of auditory events becomes as indecipherable as an ancient script.\n\nDiagnosis, elusive as it is, requires a tapestry of observation and testing. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists—they all take their turns at unraveling the disorder's mystery. They watch, they listen, they question. But no single tool exists, no definitive test to hold the truth aloft. Instead, they challenge the ears with a multitude of sounds, seeking the patterns hidden within the chaos. Advanced methods probe deeper, recording the echoes within and measuring the soul's response to its own dissonance.\n\nIn this world of sound and silence, the disorder remains a shadow, its cause a whisper lost on the wind. But in the pursuit of understanding, there is hope, a light to guide those who find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, searching for the shore.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I find myself drawn along a path leading to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to cast a light for children shadowed by abuse and neglect, and to offer solace to families adrift in turmoil. The values I bring to this field are not mere attributes but the very bedrock of my being: service, respect, an ethical compass, and a dedication to fostering relationships and honing my craft to remain steadfast and competent. These are not simply the tenets of social work; they are the marrow of my own soul.\n\nThere was always a yearning within me to aid others, yet the path was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and college, I saw many souls lost to the fog of denial, some seeking refuge in ways less than ideal. Witnessing such trials, I embarked on a journey to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the road ahead lay obscured, and so I paused after stepping forth from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, under a sun that bore witness, I visited a friend and met a boy of sixteen, his form tense upon her couch. He had come seeking refuge from an existence marred by abusive parents. The next day, the law was summoned to his home, and I went there, driven by a need to help. Speaking to the officers, I shared my concerns, and they listened as I told them of my education. They asked if I might speak with the parents. Their words were laced with unease, painting their son as a manipulator who sought intervention for what they claimed were mere trifles. It was in this moment, amidst the tangled truths and half-lies, that I realized my calling lay in social work, to aid those ensnared by such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, holds its place among my values. As a society, we raise a lament for the lost yet cling to traditions that stifle the very individuality we claim to cherish. If we mourn the lost, why do we chase sameness? I have never found comfort in such confines. Throughout my days in high school and college, I stood against the tide of social injustice: coloring my hair against convention, clothing myself in garments that sang of my spirit, piercing beyond the norm, joining the GSBA to declare my stance, fighting against the specters of racism and discrimination whenever they reared their heads. I believe in justice's cause, and I will continue to champion it against the dark.",
            "In the gloom of the scholarly inquiry, there lies the study of insomnia, the affliction that haunts the night with its silent pallor, and the paper before us seeks to unravel its mysteries through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model, with its roots deep in the hereditary soil, examines the genetic tapestry and medical nuances woven into the fabric of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the worldly bonds of environment, race, ethnicity, and the stark demarcations of demographic and socioeconomic boundaries. In this review, the shroud is lifted from insomnia as these models are laid bare, each piece of research dissected to illuminate the models, and then scrutinized, their strengths and frailties laid open to the world.\n\nThe realm of sleep, where disorders creep unseen, can be divided into primary sleep disorders, those tied to mental disquiet, and those born of other maladies. Within the primary lies Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while disorders linked to mental discord trace back to Axis I or Axis II afflictions. Still others rise from medical tribulations or the shadow of substances. The Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others—stand as sentinels of disrupted slumber, each with its tale of woe. Primary Insomnia, the thief of rest, and Primary Hypersomnia, the relentless sleep, both linger for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its specters of cataplexy and automatic REM, joins them in this dance of unrest. While Dyssomnias battle with the onset and maintenance of sleep, Parasomnias arise from behavioral and physiological anomalies, with nightmares and terrors as their harbingers. The disorders bound to mental discord, tied to Axis I or II, weave a different story. This review, however, turns its focus to insomnia, a solitary beacon amid the primary sleep disorders, as it relates to the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nIn the biological sphere, the whispers of genes and the echoes of heredity intertwine with the physiological chorus of sleep disorders. Within the hypothalamic shadows, neurons harboring orexin hold the reins of slumber and wakefulness. A study, with mice as its earthly avatars, discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, guardians of sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when called to arms, ushers in sleep, yet if silenced, it quells anxiety and beckons rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, though drawn from the world of mice, hint at echoes in the human realm, whispering of a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor. A flaw or absence in this receptor might mar one's ability to grasp sleep's embrace without aid. The sociocultural echoes of this study suggest that an inherited phenotype could dictate the dance of sleep, and any disruption in the receptor's song would ripple through life's tapestry, casting shadows on school, work, and the mundane tasks that require unwavering focus.",
            "He'd been wandering the paths of University Park now for what seemed like an eternity, though in truth it was but two and a half years, or four and a half semesters if one counted by the calendar's reckoning. In those early days, finding his way from place to place had been a trial, an ordeal of distance and weather. His first year had seen him lodged in a dormitory at the far eastern edge of the campus, beyond which lay only the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, great monuments in the emptiness. From his sanctuary in Stuart Hall, the journey to places like Willard building, set near the heart of the campus, stretched to an ungodly twenty-five minutes on foot, the trek made worse by the capricious weather that seemed to haunt State College.\n\nHe'd spoken with those who'd come before, alumni not much older than himself, who spoke of a time when the halls in the east were cut off from the rest of the world by vast barren lands. Those lands were now swallowed by sports fields, grand edifices like the new Creamery, and a health services building, all encircled by a sprawl of apartments. As the campus swelled and spread, so too did the difficulty of traversing it. The question that loomed like a shadow was how best to navigate this ever-growing expanse. The answer, simple yet profound, lay in the humble bicycle. Yet a bike alone was not enough; it needed the will of the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend, one who had returned to cycling after a long absence. His friend marveled at why he had ever given it up. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.\" In his words lay a truth as clear as the morning sun. Bicycling, in its simplicity, was the most efficient path. A bowl of oatmeal and the push of the legs could carry a soul thirty miles or more. Living off campus now, as far-flung as any dormitory, he'd come to see the wisdom in owning a bike. Each day he faced the prospect of reaching the Thomas building, a place that by foot would consume a quarter of an hour or more. Yet astride his bike, the wind in his face, he could reach it in five if he rode with purpose. The road that beckoned, Pollock Road, was the most direct route, though not without its challenges. Walking had its merits, but time was a commodity he could not afford to waste. Without his bike, the walk to Thomas would steal away thirty or forty minutes from each day, amounting to more than two and a half hours of lost time each week. Time he could not spare, for life was a tapestry of classes and appointments and other obligations that demanded his presence. He knew then, as he knew now, that the bicycle was not merely a means to an end, but a companion on this journey through the wilderness of education.",
            "In the pages of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the looming shadow of technology and the capitalist scaffold it rests upon cast a pall over humanity. The world he spins is one where the individual is subsumed into the mass, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the creed learned from the cradle. The people, mere pawns in a grander scheme, are held in thrall by a singular doctrine decreed by the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's lurking doubts about the paths these systems have hewn. Words like homogeny and reification, borrowed from Marxist discourse, underscore the novel's critique of the nascent economic order of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist concept. The common folk, their eyes blindfolded to the true ties that bind them to other classes, chase after their own gain, oblivious to the strings that control them. This ideological dominance over the proletariat and the everyday laborer is starkly portrayed in the conditioning of Brave New World's denizens. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, move through life without volition; their slumbering minds echo with the chants of consumption and indulgence, all orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the total domination of social classes by a separate few, is evident here. The lower classes, blissfully ignorant, invest in an ideology that props up the very structure that enslaves them—capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, possess the awareness but seldom act, save for a few like Bernard who stir against their chains. The interplay of these social strata offers a window into capitalism's perceived yoke.\n\nIn this brave new world, true connections between souls are but a mirage. Characters meld into a faceless throng, even those of prominence, their depths unexplored. Perhaps Huxley whispers of a world where technology and capitalism, hand in hand, strip away man's will and voice. Love is a ghost, emotions muted to dull hums; interactions are but surface ripples, evident in the men’s idle prattle about women’s physical traits, the pneumatic allure, and the women’s unabashed recounting of their liaisons. The classes' contentment with their station speaks to the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles mirrors Marxist reflections on the proletariat, lulled into believing their supremacy as long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "Four years past, I found myself in a course on Islam at CBC, a place of learning where discourse ran hot like the sands of some ancient desert. The question that flared bright among us was whether Islam bore hostility in its heart. This inquiry feels ever more pressing in the shadow of years since the towers fell. I have watched the tides of media shift from angered waves casting Islam in shadow to a strange tide of acceptance in this land of ours. In those days of 2001, could we have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage, rising to seek the mantle of leadership?\n\nThe tale of the Prophet, it calls to me with its contradictions. What history tells of Muhammad seems at odds with the portrait painted in the pages of his life. I had been taught that Muhammad was a man who wielded faith as a weapon, subduing tribes beneath the banner of Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, a figure misunderstood and humble, gathering followers by truth alone. They came to him, it says, drawn by the light of his teachings.\n\nAnd there are echoes here of another story, of Jesus and the miracles wrought in his time. The Prophet, it is said, took mutton and milk, multiplying them to feed forty souls. Such tales, penned to show Muhammad as a humble prophet of miracles, seem to me a theft of the divine story of Christ. It is as if they cloak the life of Jesus in the garb of another, seeking to borrow the light of his deeds.\n\nThe biography spins many tales of conversion, of souls turning to Islam by their own sight. Yet these are stories told through layers of voices, each a whisper from another's lips. This chain of hearsay, meant to lend truth, leaves me uneasy. It casts doubt upon the tale, like shadows on a moonlit path.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood. They speak of him as gentle, wise, and humble. But history's voice tells of a different man, of a rise to power marked not by gentleness but by force. I wonder if those who follow him now know the true story that lies beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the passage of time, the teachings of Jesus seemed to vanish like whispers in a storm, left behind as the tides of Christian thought surged forth. As one gazes upon the sprawling canvas of history, a picture emerges of a faith that has drifted from its moorings, its origins obscured by the dust of ages. Our present world, with its burgeoning awareness and fervent march toward progress, stands in stark contrast. Tradition clings to the hearts of some, those who guard their inherited truths with unyielding fervor. Yet, their numbers may not suffice to sway the collective course. Among believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken in the years to come. A restless hunger will arise to peel away the layers of doctrine accreted over time, to uncover the essence of what the Nazarene intended. It may span decades or centuries, but the tide will turn inexorably. A great unwinding will occur in the annals of Christian history, a reversion to the wellspring of its inception. A movement will gather strength, stripping away the accumulated dogmas as if time itself were reversing, leaving only the purest vision of what Jesus imparted to humanity, unmarred by the claims of later thinkers. When this wave sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes into its embrace, the church will remain, a steadfast beacon to guide the way. Yet, as theological time rewinds, the vast diversity that has flourished within Christendom will yield to a growing unity of belief and practice. Where once divisions lay between regions, denominations, and sects, there will emerge a tapestry of shared convictions. History is replete with reversals of fortune. Recall how Christians, once hunted and reviled by the Roman Empire, later saw that empire don the mantle of their faith. Our nation has journeyed from the bondage of African-American slavery to the heights of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, unraveling history's tapestry to seek its source, diminishing diversity in the process. It is vital to recognize that this transformation will hinge on a reading of Jesus' words as metaphor, not as literal decree. What, then, transpired since the days of Jesus? If we cast our gaze far enough back, we find only Judaism, the theological seedbed from which Christianity sprang forth. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures formed the bedrock by the time Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Yet, even among the Jews, unity was scarce. They fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a multitude of common folk, each with their own spirit and path.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle lies the truth of man’s nature, a revelation of greed and self-interest that festers deep within. An exposition of souls eager to clutch only at their own desires, blind to the plight of those beneath them. The tale unfolds amid the great ironworks and factories, where the owners and overseers are consumed by the lust to grow their empires vast and unyielding. They care not for the lives crushed beneath the wheels of their progress, their eyes cast only forward, oblivious to the ruin left in their wake. As Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the pollution pouring forth, an indifference to the harm inflicted upon man and beast alike. The smoke, a river of despair, the waste from the pens a testament to their disregard.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the relentless machine, toil under the lash of commerce. Their lives weighed against the almighty dollar, their worth less than the coin that buys their labor. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The hours are long, the breaks nonexistent, the threat of dismissal without warning a shadow that hovers ever close. In this time, this era of unchecked power, the law offers no shelter. The owners unleash their demands with impunity, the laborers driven faster, the conditions squalid and unforgiving.\n\nNo agency stands to offer aid, no voice to call out the injustices. The unions, twisted in their purpose, prey upon the very men they claim to protect. Sinclair’s words cut deep, revealing a population caught in the grip of a merciless machine. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A slavery of a different kind, no less harsh, no less consuming. The men and women of Packingtown, bound to their fate, their lives a testament to the cruelty of unchecked ambition.",
            "In the shadows of a world half-remembered, there lies a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, a piece he held in some esteem, called \"Dream-Land.\" Within its woven lines, the name \"Thulé\" rises, a specter from both Virgil's pen and a further origin, more recent yet no less ethereal. Virgil spoke of Thulé, a distant isle, a whisper at the edge of the world known to ancient Greeks. Yet Poe, a man drawn to the currents of German thought, found another source, a voice that beckoned from beyond the veil of time. \n\nThere is a tale told by Karl J. Arndt, of Poe's dance with the ghost of Goethe. In Arndt's telling, Poe's verses echo those of Goethe, a mimicry or perhaps a homage. The Oxford Companion whispers of Goethe, a master of words, his Faust a crown of poetic drama, split across the years, the first act in 1808, the second as Goethe himself passed into the shadow in 1832. Amidst this magnum opus lies a sliver of verse, \"The King of Thulé,\" a lament of loss and a goblet heavy with memory. A king bereft, drowning in drink, and at last, casting his last tie to the world into the sea before following it into the abyss.\n\nThe king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" mirrors this tragic monarch, a shadowy reflection in a world of half-light. Poe, a soul perhaps haunted by loss and the numbing balm of the bottle, saw in this tale a kinship. Less than a year before he penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invoked Thule, a word like a talisman, twice in his collected works. In \"Dream-Land,\" Thule bookends the tale, a dark twin to Goethe's king. The landscape painted in Poe's verses is one of desolation, a haunted land where specters of lost friends roam, a realm stripped of color.\n\nPoe's admiration for Goethe, if not directly, was perhaps filtered through his esteem for Tennyson, a poet of great regard. In the echoes of Tennyson's verses, Poe might have heard the refrains of Goethe, a melody carried on the winds of literary creation, in the many iterations that surfaced after the original had been cast into the world. In those lines, the shadow of Thule looms, a place both real and imagined, a bridge between the realms of the living and the dead.",
            "In the quiet aisles of the grocery store, under the indifferent watch of fate and the fluorescent glow of the overhead lights, an applesauce spill lay waiting. A customer might wonder if such an innocuous event could unravel into something larger, something with consequences that stretch beyond the simple act of slipping and falling. For Jennifer Palmer, it did. She found herself entwined in a narrative of negligence and disregard, a tale told not by words but by the actions of a manager who turned a blind eye.\n\nPaul Martin, the manager, had been informed. Once, twice. The applesauce spill was not a secret, hidden in the shadows. Rich Wayne, a dutiful employee, brought it to light at five in the afternoon, and again, Mary J. Haddigan spoke of it. Each time, Martin's response was the same, a dismissive shrug, a preoccupation with his dinner, the mundane over the immediate. By half-past five, Jennifer Palmer lay on the cold, hard floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's indifference.\n\nIn the courts of California, they speak of malice. Of actions taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm they might cause. They speak of despicable acts, of conduct so far removed from the common decency expected of mankind that it demands retribution. Palmer would argue that Martin's knowledge of past injuries, his awareness of the peril the spill posed, should have stirred him to action. Yet, like the indifferent hands of a clock ticking away the minutes, he let the danger persist.\n\nThe question was not whether she could claim her due for the injury sustained, but whether she could reach beyond the tangible and claim punitive damages. For in California, to breach an obligation, to act with oppression, fraud, or malice, is to open oneself to the weight of justice. And Martin's actions, or lack thereof, might well be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of others. As the statute reads, malice might not require intent to harm but merely the willful ignorance of potential harm.\n\nPalmer's tale was not of a single fall, but of a pattern, a series of incidents ignored. In 2009, five slip-and-fall incidents had already marked the history of D&D Markets, and yet, Martin's actions remained unchanged. The narrative of negligence wound through the months, leading inexorably to Palmer's fall. And now, she stood on the precipice of justice, the law as her guide, seeking not just compensation, but a recognition of the wrong inflicted by Martin's callous indifference.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the courts will hear her plea for punitive damages, whether they will see in Martin's actions the malice required by law. But in the gathering shadows of the courtroom, as the echoes of past judgments linger in the air, one thing is clear: the story of Jennifer Palmer and the applesauce spill is more than a simple tale of injury. It is a testament to the power of accountability, a reminder that actions, no matter how small, can have consequences vast and far-reaching. And that justice, though sometimes slow, is relentless in its pursuit.",
            "She had always felt as if there was something she needed, some yearning etched deep within her bones. It was a longing that refused to be quelled, a desire unfulfilled. It began when she was about fourteen, just stepping into the threshold of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years on at the age of seventeen. By now, she had come to know it was not a thing she craved, but a someone. Yet no boy stirred her interest. There were those who had been drawn to her, stumbling through their awkward rituals to charm the uncharmable, but none found her favor. She often questioned herself, pondering this oddity, searching for reasons why such a strange thing would plague a girl her age. Years of contemplation had birthed theories, but none held enough truth for her to dwell upon. So she lived her life, a constant interrogation of her own desires.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle folk, calm and untroubled. They never quarreled, not with each other, and seldom with their daughter. The only discord arose from her pursuit of independence, her free spirit clashing against their quietude. She was a daughter born of placid stock, yet she countered their tranquility with her vibrant personality, making her quite likable alongside her inherent kindness.\n\nToday, however, peace was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, a short scream pierced the air, her mother's voice, once lovely, now strained. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, breathless. Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face, each breath an \"Ow\" escaping her lips. Her daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words came in gasps, squeezed out through the veil of agony. \"Okay, Mom, tell me how I can help.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital awaited with its scent of antiseptic and fear, a place where sickness held court. Yet she was blind to it all, her mind consumed with the task of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly, calling out for assistance. Faces, etched with worry, converged around them. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for examination. The girl was left alone, seated in the waiting room, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase hidden in the highest cabinet, a simple misstep that had brought them here.",
            "In the quiet pursuit of understanding what lay beneath the surface of human frailty, a study set out across the land to uncover the mysteries of the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet as it came to be known. Word carried that this way of living, mirrored in a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, held promises of guarding against the harsh grasp of chronic heart disease and stroke, and even the shadows of stroke mortality. This aMed diet, a variation upon the Mediterranean theme, spoke of a life rich in the bounty of the earth—plant foods and their proteins, fruits and nuts of the land, grains whole and legumes. It favored the warmth of olive oils over the cold of saturated fats and asked for the creatures of the sea over those of the land. It allowed for modest toasts with wine, for it did not demand asceticism.\n\nThe old tales of prior studies whispered of a bond between the Med diet and a lesser burden of death, both total and of the heart. One trial, like an ancient saga, showed this diet more potent than the path of low-fat living, helping shed the weight of flesh and balance the blood's humors. Yet in the past, the focus had not lain upon the specter of stroke or its lethal kin.\n\nThis tale followed the journey of 74,886 women, bound by the Nurses' Health Study, wandering from their youth into the autumn of age, with no history of cardiac or diabetic ills. Over two decades, from 1984 to 2004, they bore witness through their own words, self-reported visions of their feasts upon questionnaires designed to capture the essence of their dietary past year by year. In this passage of time, more than ninety-five in a hundred remained steadfast. The tales they told were verified against the hard truth of records and certificates, though some stories, lacking proof, were deemed probable, and so they entered this chronicle—tales of stroke and heart's failure.\n\nTo see clearly through the haze of chance, the scholars took the scores from the aMed diet, each a whispered echo of years past, and averaged them, seeking a true reflection of long-term fidelity to this diet. They adjusted for life's many confounding paths: age, the smoke of tobacco, the heaviness of body, the hormonal changes of womanhood, the intake of vitamins and spirits, the vigor of one's leisure, and the use of aspirin.\n\nThey employed the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, their way of seeing the unseen threads linking aMed scores to the risk of heart and stroke, separating the fatal from the nonfatal, each type its own story.\n\nIn the end, the tale told of women who walked the path of the Mediterranean diet with fidelity, who bore higher aMed scores, and who found themselves less burdened by the specter of heart disease and stroke. Over the span of twenty years, there appeared 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 deaths from the silent killer of cardiovascular disease. Those women who stood in the highest quintile of aMed scores faced a lesser risk than those in the lowest, their relative risk a mere 0.71. Thus, the story passed into the annals of time, a testament to the power of the Mediterranean way.",
            "The sign bore the words like a dire whisper from another age. Hitler is alive in Burma. On the corner of the street stood Ellen Page, the actress from Juno, solitary with her placard held aloft. The letters scrawled in Sharpie ink told a tale of unsettling portent. Burma, the land known also as Myanmar, lay in the grip of a brutal militant junta. They had seized power in the year 1962, a coup d’état that cast a long shadow over the nation. The year 2007 saw the streets swell with the first protests in a decade. The monks, clad in robes the color of saffron, led the charge. The Saffron Revolution, they named it, for the hue of their vestments. The populace began to stir, to rise, and the junta soon met them with violence. It was like war. A war waged upon the peaceful, the monasteries stormed by soldiers. Foreign journalists were snatched from the streets, imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty for bearing witness. Official reports spoke of 13 dead, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, whispered of a hidden carnage. “The bodies can be counted in several thousand,” he said.\n\nThis tale is old as time. Governments, since the dawn of civilization, have sought to crush dissent, to hold dominion over their people. The emperors of Rome claimed divine favor for their reign. In Japan, emperors were seen as gods incarnate, leading their people with technology and ritual, and our own president, George W. Bush, spoke regularly with Ted Haggard, who led the Stupid People Worldwide under the Republic Party’s banner.\n\nTales of such tyranny are like shadows cast long across history. The June 4th protest of 1989 at Tiananmen Square comes to mind, where students and intellectuals, laborers and visionaries, gathered to defy the government's iron hand. The numbers of the dead are as disparate as the stories told, the Chinese government speaking of hundreds while the Red Cross whispered of thousands more. Then there was Rwanda, in the 1990s, where the Hutu militias, with the government's aid, began their grim work, the systematic slaughter of the Tutsis and any who dared to moderate. And the specter of Hitler's Third Reich, a shadow that fell across nations, a time of terror for those of Jewish descent, speaks of the extremes to which such power can reach.",
            "In the dim corridors of jazz history, the figure of Duke Ellington rises like a shadow cast long by a setting sun. His presence, a subtle whisper behind the keys, speaks less of the man himself and more of the vast tapestry he wove. A tapestry where each thread, each note, each pause, bore the weight of his genius. Ellington, the silent architect, built cathedrals of sound where the voices of his orchestra soared. In the spaces he created, soloists found their freedom, their voices unfurling like banners in the wind. Yet, beyond the improvisations, there lay a precision, a structure woven tight as the skin of a drum, calling forth the specific hues of his band’s timbre to paint his musical visions. His mastery lay not only in the individual notes but in the grand symphony of souls he orchestrated, each player a vital part of the luminous whole. \n\nThe pages of the Grove Music Dictionary speak of Ellington’s sound, his innovation, as they whisper of the Creole Love Call. In this composition, Ellington’s voice, devoid of words, becomes a color, a texture, a spirit inhabiting the air. It is an early testament to his vision, where voices meld with instruments in a dance of sound and silence. The call and response, a dialogue between voice and reeds, unfolds in the slow pulse of a twelve-bar blues. Each chorus, a chapter in a tale told without words, sings with the raw clarity of life itself. The muted trumpet’s lament, the clarinet’s high cry, the full band’s echo—all converge in a crescendo before settling back into the primal call of voice and reeds. Here, the voice growls, an instrument unto itself, before a trombone’s dissonant mutter brings the tale to a close.\n\nIn the year that followed, as the world turned and the notes of Hot and Bothered filled the air, Ellington’s genius continued its quiet revolution. The call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing intertwines, a dialogue of soul and spirit, of flesh and wind. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) carries this conversation forward, where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone becomes the voice of the earth, grounding the melody in the eternal dance of sound and silence. In these compositions, Ellington’s legacy is not merely heard—it is felt, a pulse beneath the skin, a whisper in the dark.",
            "In the silent corridors of time, where life etches its relentless march, a question lingers like smoke in the hollow of a long-forgotten chamber: why do creatures evolve the way they do? Are there unseen chains that bind and guide the hand of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in the year of 1917, mused upon this and remarked how the language of numbers had yet to capture even the simplest forms that dwell in nature's realm. A sentiment not yet outgrown even by our modern age. Yet, with the passing years, the art of mathematical modeling has been cast upon the spiral shells of mollusks, tracing the lineage of their form through the eons, as Raup and Stanley once did in 1981. Herein, we embark on a journey, a study, to unearth how these mathematical whispers, spoken in the growth and evolution of Prunum, can unravel the mysteries of their becoming. Through the eyes of X-ray, we chart the bones of their shells, setting parameters that the mind might use to dream both of what is and what could be. These numbers find voice in the program CerioShell, a creation of Stone in 1995, conjuring shapes that might dwell within the bounds of what is possible. And alongside these phantoms, experiments and observation weave their tale, seeking to illuminate the grand tapestry of life's change.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a journey—a tube winding its way through the vast compass of time and space. Each turn, each curve, is a whorl spiraling around an imagined axis, the columella, steadfast and true. The pace of its dance varies, and where each whorl meets its next is marked by a suture, a line of demarcation. In the end, it is the largest whorl, the body whorl, that stands as the crowning chapter of its story. The spire, it is called, all whorls save for the last, with the apex a beacon at its tip and the base its anchor. Through an aperture, the creature within peers out, extending into the world beyond.\n\nThese shells, they can be seen from many eyes: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common gaze is apertural, with the opening toward the eye and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nTo count these whorls, one must begin from above, from the apical view. There, the first suture marks the beginning, and from it, a line is drawn to cleave the shell into two. Whorls are tallied from this line, estimated to the quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell, it is a series of doorways, moving through the tapestry of time, as the creature builds its home around itself. One might trace this path, marking the center of each aperture, measuring its breadth and height.\n\nIn this dance of creation, numbers are woven, and once the figures are known, the shell's genesis can be altered, its story rewritten in the language of mathematics.",
            "In the dim lands of Indonesia, where the sun sets upon the archipelago and the night gathers close, the little lives of newborns flicker in the shadows, unmoved by the turning years. The tale of their survival, of mothers too, is a story writ in numbers, a litany of promises unmet. The aims of the Millennium, those lofty goals, loom unfulfilled while water runs clean and the earth is washed of its stains. Yet the hearts of mothers and the breaths of babes still falter in their quest for life, their hopes not yet measured against the mark set for them by time’s unyielding hand.\n\nIn the villages and towns, where the cries of life begin, there are hands that catch and hands that fail. Seventy-two in a hundred now know the touch of those skilled in the art of life’s beginning, yet still, the old ways linger. The midwives, with their ancient wisdom, cannot stave off the blood’s dark tide when it rises, and so the death of mothers is a sorrow all too known, the loss a testament to what yet needs doing. The numbers speak of progress, yet they lie in their silence, for the work remains unfinished.\n\nThe children suffer too, their small bodies wracked by the old foes of water and waste. The healers who once came now come less often, and the care they need after birth is but a shadow, a whisper lost in the wide expanse of this land. The cut that saves, the surgeon’s knife, is a stranger to many, its edge rarely felt. In the cities, it finds its place, yet in the fields, it remains but a rumor, a story told in the hushed voices of women who walk the long road to hope.\n\nAnd in this place of disparity, where the rich find solace in the arms of medicine, the poor stand outside, their hands empty, their pockets bare. The choice that lies before those who would change this tale is a stark one: to carve out a path for each ailment or to weave a broader tapestry that holds all in its embrace. The allure of focused work is bright, its goals clear and its rewards swift. But the cost is high, for to choose one is to forsake another, and the balance tilts, leaving some in shadow.\n\nIn this land of islands, where the sea binds and separates, the question remains: how to care for the mothers and the children, how to bring light to the places where the night has long held sway. It is a question of choices, of paths untaken, of a future yet to be written in the lives of those who wait for the dawn.",
            "In the annals of time stretching back a century, popular music has unfurled into a tapestry so vast and intricate that to name each thread is a fool's errand. The strands of genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each birthing a multitude of offspring, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a lineage unending. Among these, the branch of Heavy Metal stands, a colossus in the realm of popular sound, evolving and shifting over the last four decades into a beast most diverse and expressive. Its voice is a chorus of emotions, a symphony dwelling in the shadows. From its nascent cries, the genre revealed a malleability, a clay in the sculptor's hand, giving rise to myriad forms, each more intricate than the last, until the present where the lines between them blur and fade.\n\nIn this modern epoch, the heavy metal landscape is a labyrinth of niches, each with its own tongue and lore, so much so that the essence of metal itself eludes definition. It is an amalgam, a mingling of echoes from distant genres, yet it remains a creation with roots. To grasp the metal that reverberates through today’s halls, one must seek the heart of the metal movement, for it is not merely a genre but a force, a revolution.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in shadow. It is a symphony of excess, an anthem of more—more bass, more volume, more fury, more spectacle. A departure from the primitive, it demands skill, mastery, and those who wield it, they possess a prowess that bleeds into the music. Metal is a journey down paths of altered states, a testament to the psychedelic haze of the mid-seventies when minds unfurled and creation knew no bounds, the music transcending into realms unknown, drug-fueled and unapologetic. This was music that embraced the visceral, the dark, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that dominated before. The legacy of such darkness finds its roots entwined with the Romantic Era, a time when shadows danced upon the stage of art. The words of songs, like those found in Helter Skelter, speak of this darkness, a descent into chaos that marked the Beatles’ foray into the heavy, a retort to the Rolling Stones, a declaration that they too could walk the paths of shadows.\n\nThus, the tale of metal unfolds, a narrative of darkness and excess, of mastery and movement, echoing through the corridors of time.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would lay their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, crafting his own dreams with the patience of a man who knew them precious. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, stands as a testament not only to a woman's wonderment at a land conjured in sleep but also to Rousseau’s own longings, the visions that drove his brush. Since he first took up the craft, he sought not just to paint but to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold of artists and those who marveled at their creations. Yet this path was not without its trials, a struggle within his heart, torn between the safety of imitation and the wild, uncharted lands of his own imagination. The Dream is a canvas of this struggle, an embodiment of Rousseau's battle to either mimic the styles that might grant him acceptance in the eyes of the art world's elite or to set forth on his own, carving a path through the thicket of his own creativity.\n\nTo ponder The Dream in this light, one must wander back through the story of Rousseau himself. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, northwest of France, his life began not with the strokes of a brush but in the hands of his father, a tinsmith by trade, who knew the comforts of a modest prosperity (Shattuck 47). No academies opened their doors to Rousseau in his youth; instead, he toiled for the nation, a gabelou in the toll service, though those who spoke of him often erred, calling him a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight of his children, left him with but one daughter, Julia, and a sorrow as deep as the ocean (Shattuck 49). In painting, he sought refuge, a new beginning in the colors and forms that might offer solace. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romantic hues, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams as humble and earnest as those of his kin.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's yearning for acknowledgment within the art world is to see it for what it was, a natural longing. He was a man who came late to the canvas, untrained by the formalities of art schools, painting in the shadow of giants. It was only as Matisse began to be whispered about in the circles of art that Rousseau felt the first glimmer of recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon draws a line between the two—Matisse, who feared nothing more than the mundane in art, and Rousseau, whose dream was to create a work so pleasingly conventional that he might gain entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the vast wilderness of thought where the great minds roam, there lies a path that winds between ethics and beauty, truth and their mirrored reflections. Like the words etched upon the ancient urn that Keats once pondered, beauty and truth are intertwined, bound in a dance as old as time itself. We learn much in this life through the schooling of books or the harsh tutelage of experience, yet the appreciation of what is moral and what is beautiful seems innate, a knowledge unspoken and untaught, whispered to us on the winds of existence. These are not matters of dictation but of revelation, a quest to uncover the why behind the art or the act, not the how.\n\nCritics might gather around da Vinci's Mona Lisa, speaking of light and shadow, the stories held within each brushstroke, yet at the heart of it lies an enigma unsolved, a whisper of something beyond words. When one speaks of a cherished tale or a painting that stirs the soul, the explanation often begins with that elusive phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" before reason takes its ponderous course. The essence of art and morality slips through the fingers of analysis, leaving behind a residue of the infinite. As O'Connor so rightly put it, a story is the vessel for what cannot be simply stated, a bridge to the unsayable. The spirit of a tale lingers beyond its telling, just as ethics speaks in silence, transcending the bounds of language. As Wittgenstein mused, ethics dwells in the realm of the transcendental, echoing the same ineffable quality that art possesses.\n\nIn the realm of the unseen, where the noumenal lies, as Kant might have described, is where art and morality resonate most deeply within us. These are felt rather than explained, touching us in places where words falter. Literature, with its woven tapestry of words, stands apart, carrying the weight of moral truths like no other art. It is here where the threads of life and story intertwine, where the values lived and the values written are one and the same. In literature's embrace, we find reflections of ourselves, the truths we hold and the truths we seek, as crucial to our being as the air we breathe or the paths we tread.",
            "In the days long past, before the world was as it is now, there lay a land called Germania. A place neither bound by a single name nor a single tale. It stretched out from the cold Baltic shores down through the dark forests and rising alps, a land of shadows and quiet might. From München's alpine watch to Kiel's windswept edge, a whisper of its culture lingered, a tapestry woven from countless threads. The Rhine bore witness to Köln, and the Elbe cradled Dresden, each city a note in a long-forgotten song. A nation united now from the remnants of many tribes and peoples.\n\nThe scholars and historians debate still from whence the name Germania was born. Some speak of Tacitus, who named the Tungrians as the first of the Germans, those who once stood against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his writings of conquest, called them “Germanus,” a name borrowed from the very Gauls he subjugated, a mark to distinguish the unconquered from the conquered. The records tell of battles fought across the Rhine, of skirmishes and wars waged by those fierce tribes. A name whose root is tangled in language, perhaps from the spears they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout echoing in the din of war.\n\nIt was Tacitus who penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in the year of our Lord 98, writing of the Germans, those who seemed to him untouched by the mingling of races. He spoke of them as aboriginal, their land a wild and inhospitable place, where skies wept cold and manners were sullen. Who would forsake the warmth of Africa or Asia for such a realm unless it was their own? \n\nAnd yet, the Romans did not abandon their empire for Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking out its riches and its men to serve under the eagle's standard. The tribes lived on the empire's edge, trading their wares and their strength, a borderland where cultures met and mingled, but seldom mixed. The Romans ventured forth, but always returned, leaving Germania as it was, a land of mystery and might.",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its web, a tool of deception stretching long and thin, but in the end, the masquerade must be cast off. For a soul risks losing its own reflection should it cling too tightly to the mask. Yet, to unravel such deceit is to chance a solitude, the self set adrift from the harbor of kinship. One must choose then, between the preservation of the self or the tethered bonds of those around. For there are those who might shrug off the trickery with indifference, while others might feel the sting of betrayal, the charade a bitter pill.\n\nWhen the cloak of disguise wraps itself around the guise of gender, it stirs questions deep as the night, questions of why one would bury their true self beneath another’s skin. Viola, adrift in a foreign land, dons the garb of a man, a shield against the unknown: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse spares her but at a cost, severing her from the sisterhood of women, a lifeline cut short. Her deception is so complete that Olivia, bewildered, sees her as Sebastian and love’s folly ensues: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, beneath the surface, there stirs a forbidden longing with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nIn the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tapestry of hidden truths, whereby deception lays bare the desires buried deep, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The play whispers of unspoken longings, brought forth by the presence of Viola under the guise of Cesario. Does Olivia's heart truly leap for Cesario's male facade, or does it harbor a secret yearning for women? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia serves as Shakespeare's jest, a mirror of those who judge by appearance alone. Her swift affections, turned from Cesario to Sebastian, reveal a heart easily swayed, her regard for Cesario/Viola shifting to sisterly kinship: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the vast expanse of history, there are shadows cast by empires long fallen, and among them, the German colonial rule stands stark in its memory of harshness. In the arid lands of South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the echoes of genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people speak of a brutality unmasked. Yet, to paint the entire German colonial endeavor with a single brush is a folly of simplification. The empire, sprawling across distant lands, mirrored the complexity of its geography in its disparate policies and governance. \n\nWhen the British seized control of German East Africa in the year 1919, they unearthed a landscape rich with educated souls. In the classrooms of Tanganyika, minds had been nurtured under a German sky. Kamerun, too, bore witness to scholarly praise, the efforts of the educators resonating through time. \n\nBut South West Africa told a different tale. There, beneath the relentless sun, the education of the native was largely a mission of faith, entrusted to the hands of missionaries with scant support from the governing hands. The settlers' children, the European progeny, found favor in the eyes of the state. Schools were built, resources poured, and the holy mission of education was regulated and funded. Yet, the native children remained shadows in their own land, untouched by the light of knowledge, wandering in the dark of ignorance.\n\nThe soil of South West Africa bore the scars of decisions made long before. While other colonies could count their learned, in these lands, the silence of illiteracy reigned. The reasons for this stark divergence are writ in the annals of social and political forces, the attitudes of settlers and rulers alike shaping a destiny. This tale seeks to unearth those buried truths, to sift through the sands of time and bring forth understanding.\n\nIn the dusty tomes of history, the story of German colonial education unfolds, penned in the language of its origin. Scholars of a bygone era sought to chronicle the systems of learning that spanned the empire. Later voices, speaking in the English tongue, broadened the discourse, laying bare the contrasts between these far-flung territories. Among them, Cohen's words stand prominent, comparing the schools of South West Africa to those of East Africa, unraveling the threads that weave their differences. Cohen speaks of the settlers, their numbers a force that shaped the educational path of South West Africa.\n\nBeneath the German sun, South West Africa offered a climate more forgiving than its brethren lands, yet its heart was a desert, unforgiving and vast. By 1913, the white settlers numbered nearly 15,000, their presence a testament to the land's relative hospitality. In East Africa, the numbers dwindled, a mere 5,336 calling it home, the next largest contingent in the empire's fold.\n\nThus, in the corridors of history, the tale of German colonial education in South West Africa unfolds, a tapestry of contrasts and complexities, echoing through the ages.",
            "There was a time when the United States and Mexico stood as adversaries, their rivalry stretching over the long span of fifty-seven years, from the year 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by strife, a time when the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848 reached its fevered pitch. The United States, in its relentless pursuit, laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the grip of Mexico. The clashes between these nations were many, a tide that waned only with the approach of the First World War. At the heart of this conflict lay a chasm of differences—religion, culture, tradition—each a stone in the edifice of their discord, each a source of material strife.\n\nThis tale of two nations is not unlike the tales of others, nations bound by borders and bound by the rivalries those borders breed. For where lines are drawn upon the earth, so too are lines drawn in the hearts of men. David M. Pletcher speaks of this, saying that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems,\" for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the United States, while others in the Latin expanse have found a different fate.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, cast its shadow between the two nations, a rift that has long haunted the annals of history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in the days of old, Americans stood opposed not to fascism or communism, but to Catholicism and monarchy. It was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War's contest of wills, but here the struggle was rooted in the soul, in the beliefs that each nation held dear. This distrust was not born anew but inherited from the colonial past, a legacy of the English and the Spanish, a barrier to the peace that might have been.\n\nDiehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes within that span of rivalry, disputes that echo the cries of border raids and frontier upheavals. Bandits and outlaws, marauders of the border towns, were a scourge until at last, the United States and Mexico took up arms to secure their borders. Yet with time, the rivalry waned, as Schmitt observes, for Mexico grew reliant on the United States, and the ambitions of America turned away from conquest of land to the allure of economic entanglements in Mexican soil.\n\nAnd so the tale of rivalry softened, the years of strife yielding to a new era, an era where the shadows of the past lingered still but no longer cast their darkest pall.",
            "Fifteen years past and the world had turned brittle beneath me, taken by an illness unknown, a shadow without form or name. I was a nurse then, a choice born from a hunger for the safety I’d never known in childhood. The words were a chant in my youth: you’ll always find work; folks will always fall ill. So it was I walked a path not my own, my dreams of science and stories left to wither, tending instead to the sick and the weary.\n\nYet there I stood, forty-six years gone, alone, the coffers empty, no work to grasp. The years unfurled, living on the mercy of Social Security, each day a struggle against the dark tide gnawing at my soul. Certainty had fled, but truth remained—without family and a few steadfast friends, I’d not have endured. Disaster, when it comes, strips strength to the bone and leaves you hollow.\n\nLife’s course is fraught with storms, some small, others sweeping. No promise holds forever, and though we prepare, some burdens are too great to bear alone. We in this land of ours must turn from the crumbling promise of government’s hand, moldy and frayed, and find in each other the strength we crave. Trust must be reborn, a hand offered in both giving and accepting aid, not each of us alone behind walls of stone.\n\nThe rugged spirit they speak of, that built this place, was not borne of solitude but rather the thread of compassion and shared toil. Those who crossed the Rockies did not find the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo gather your provisions, as I have mine—kits for disaster, supplies for healing, water to be made clean, and windows to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their power, candles and matches to light the darkness, stores of food to ward off hunger’s call. If land is yours to till, let it yield sustenance. A wood stove stands ready for those not bound by city walls.\n\nYet amid your preparations, do not forget the faces around you. Reach out, learn the names of those who dwell beside you.",
            "In a time long past, in the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince came into the world, destined to be known as Buddha. A man who would cast away the trappings of his princely life to walk the path of enlightenment. His teachings, like seeds scattered in the wind, took root and grew into what is now called Buddhism. Among its branches, the oldest and most unyielding is Theravada Buddhism. This faith, stretching back some twenty-five hundred years, has shifted and morphed through the ages, its visage now different from when the Buddha himself walked the earth. These changes are apparent everywhere, in places like Sri Lanka, where the waters are cut by ceremony each year. Monks and lay folk both partake in this rite, which holds a weight of belief despite never being spoken of by the Buddha himself. Such transformations ripple from surface rituals to the very essence of the faith's doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist fold, both those who don the robes and those who do not, have seen their guiding principles change, swayed by tides both internal and external, both harsh and gentle.\n\nTo speak of these shifts, one must grasp the terms of the discourse. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhasasana's own ranks, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, by contrast, hail from those outside the Buddhist fold. Those forces that bear hostility seek to tear at the fabric of Buddhism, born from eyes that regard it with malice. Yet there are also forces indifferent, benign, which neither wish harm nor aid, though they may do one or the other inadvertently. These terms will weave through our tale like threads in a tapestry.\n\nWe must first turn our eyes to the heart of the faith—the doctrines at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Believers seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma finds its voice in the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka cradles the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the laws that bind, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical depths. Here lie notions of Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the ever-present suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara’s end, so too shall end the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out rules for life. For the common folk, there are five precepts: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from theft, from sexual misconduct, and from intoxicants. For those who wear the saffron robes, the rules multiply. At the faith’s foundation lie the four noble truths. First, the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the suffering that life brings. Second, the realization that attachment is the root of suffering. Third, the belief that suffering can indeed be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models.

The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed precincts of any bargaining table, culture looms large, a specter both known and unknown, defined as much by absence as by presence. It is no monolith nor singularity, but a tapestry woven with contradictions and myriad hues. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to grasp at straws, to paint with such broad strokes that the canvas remains blank. A negotiator's true task lies in discerning the heart of the matter, the pulse of the culture that sits across from him, its rhythms and its truths, and how these will dance in the conversation between them. As one steps into the realm of another culture, it is seen through the prism of one's own, and inevitably, mirrors are held up to each other.\n\nTo fathom the depths of a foreign mind is to wander through its past, to acknowledge its biases without censure or change, to meet it where it stands, especially when one's own footing is less sure. When the ground beneath is unfamiliar, respect for the sacred rites and beliefs of others becomes an ally, bridging the chasm of misunderstanding and pushing the discourse forward.\n\nYet culture is not confined to the boundaries of nations. Within the borders of a single land, companies cultivate their own ethos. Some value the grinding tick of the office clock, others the gentle flow of time unbound. Such cultures reveal themselves in the garb of their people, in words spoken plainly or cloaked, in the division of tasks and the paths to upward mobility. Philanthropy may be encouraged at every level or funneled solely through sanctioned channels. Look to America and see the mosaic of corporate cultures, each distinct, even as they share the same soil. A harmony of exteriors may belie deeper intricacies, calling for a more profound exploration.\n\nValues, the bedrock of culture, whisper the reasons behind actions. Where honor and collective peace are cherished, a negotiator will not sully another's name to gain an edge. In cultures where a hard bargain holds sway, the rush to settle may not be felt. These truths must be understood long before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, to truly negotiate, to find common ground, one must look beyond the general to the individual, to see the person behind the culture.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. So it is written in the Psalms, the ancient words echoing through the halls of time. Anselm took these words to heart, weaving them into the tapestry of his argument for the existence of the Almighty. In this reflection of the divine, Aquinas too found his voice, their twin songs rising in defense of a singular truth. But to weigh the merit of their claims, one must first assume the existence of this God they both champion, for their arguments are bound to a vision of the divine that brooks no rival. \n\nAnselm's path is one of inward turning, seeking the divine spark within. His argument is a journey of the soul, a reaching for understanding through the lens of faith. He speaks of God as a presence in the mind, a truth that cannot be unthought. The proof, he says, is within, in the silent spaces of the heart where God already dwells. It is a knowing, an acceptance of that which defies the grasp of reason, a trust in unseen certainties. This faith, they say, is the evidence of things not seen.\n\nAquinas walks a different road. His is the path of reason, of logic and the empirical. He offers five arguments, each a stone on the path to God: change and causation, contingency and degrees of excellence, and finally, the harmony of the world. In these, he finds necessity, a puzzle whose missing piece is God. He would have us believe through reason alone, a logic that needs no leap of faith. To see the world is to see the hand that crafts it. \n\nAnd so they stand, Anselm and Aquinas, each with their proofs, each with their truths. Yet neither holds the whole, for the divine is a mystery beyond the grasp of mortal minds. What they offer are glimpses, shadows on the wall of the cave. The heart knows what the mind cannot hold, and in that knowing, there is God.",
            "The way of words is a curious thing, how they lay upon the page like shadows cast by some unseen light. Authors weave them with intent, hoping to stir in the hearts of readers a certain notion or sentiment. Some weave better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he knew well the art of this weaving in his tale of The Great Gatsby. He took to pairing words that would not naturally find themselves together, shaping an atmosphere around his characters and their world. And then there were the colors, symbols imbued with meaning, each a thread in the tapestry he wove. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink. In Gatsby, Fitzgerald gave these colors life, a breath of significance that lingered long after the page was turned.\n\nWhite and gray, they spoke of sameness, of things worn and faded, white a little more refined, gray a little more weary. Fitzgerald set these colors to work from the start, painting his world in their hues. Daisy and Jordan, perpetually draped in white—like specters of privilege. All around, white was the color of choice: Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gaudy gala, Tom in his white shirt when he sought out Myrtle, even Catherine powdered in a milky white. The absence of white, the splash of primary colors at Gatsby's party, was a jarring thing. Common things were painted white or gray: the white chasms of New York, the gray names of Gatsby's revelers, Catherine’s apartment a slice of white cake in a city of sameness. Plain folk and places were painted thus: Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray stretch of cars and land in the valley of ashes, the Italian child a shade of gray, the dog-seller an old gray man.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald had laid out these colors, he used them to mark the mundane, the unremarkable. Daisy, in her white dress and her little white roadster, became less a person and more a thing, a piece of Gatsby's longing, an object of desire. Time and again, Daisy is shrouded in white, her presence diminished to a mere uniformity—her fur collar a gray haze, her dress white as Tom and Gatsby clash over her. Fitzgerald, in his way, used colors to strip away the layers of his characters until the truth lay bare.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the earth gives itself over to growth, the land spreads out beneath the mild sky, a cradle of bounty. This place where tomatoes and citrus take root, where leafy greens unfurl and the peppers hang like jewels upon the vine. Here, the land is a testament to what the sun and soil can conjure. Peaches and lemons, berries, and honey, all drawn from the earth's grasp. There is a hunger for what grows without the taint of man’s artifice, a market for the organic fruits of the earth, and in San Diego, it is a desire not easily sated. Here, the eggs and the milk bear the mark of nature's hand, and the farms open their gates, inviting the curious to walk the paths between the rows. The landowner finds in these endeavors a chance to align with programs that promise both sustenance and sanctuary, to marry profit with preservation.\n\nYet, the road of organic farming is not without its trials. The absence of chemicals demands a greater toil, a vigilance against the encroachment of pests and weeds. The soil must be nourished from the hands of those who tend it, forgoing the ease of modern alchemy. Such labor is a costly endeavor, and the small farms lack the vastness of their industrial kin. To maintain the wild among the cultivated, to plant cover crops, to guide the grazing herd, to root out the invasive, these too demand a toll. The landowner, in seeking to blend the wild with the till, may look to those with knowledge or means to ease the burden while enriching the land.\n\nThe chosen ground lies near Potrero, a tract of chaparral and oak, of grassland that whispers in the wind beside the Cleveland National Forest. Here, in the ecoregion of the Southern Foothills, a plan takes shape, a conservation of the many species whose fates hang in balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies and the gnatcatcher, all woven into the fabric of this place, some clinging to the edge of memory.\n\nLong before, this land bore the footprints of those who knew it first, the Native Americans, and then those who came with cattle and saws in the age of iron and steam. A homestead it was, where beasts grazed and timber fell to the ax. I took this parcel from the lists of property, seeking what the land might offer to those who wish to farm and to preserve. To find what the earth might give and what might be given back, I looked to the nearby farm that thrives on the same soil.",
            "There is a tether between brothers, a cord that binds and holds, unyielding and eternal. Within this tether lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than any soul who stands outside their shared blood, and they see themselves mirrored in each other's eyes. It is when the world presses hardest upon them that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, be it for good or ill. When these emotions rise to the surface, they come at a cost. To grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the consequences they bring. When one meets a brother's gaze and sees within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as the world sees them but as they truly are. It is in their deeds and the consequences of those deeds that their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, and with them walk the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Across a lush, vividly described landscape, they embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in a scene of finality, and only one brother emerges from its shadow. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the swirling complexities within the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.  \nThe protagonist's deeds are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he first steps out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated venture, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother to teach worldly skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high fork of the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams were shattered, for Doodle was born with a heart frail as tissue, making his survival unlikely. Even if he lived, the prospect of vigorous physical feats was a distant dream. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, his head brimming with wild fantasies, to have them dashed in a heartbeat. Indeed, he even bears a dark anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating smothering him with a pillow. What child considers such a dire act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him. Such a simple gesture fills the protagonist with hope, revealing that his conviction was weak. Deep within, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the vast wilderness of the mind where shadows flicker and the unknown looms, the human brain stands as a labyrinthine creation, a masterwork of complexity and invention. From the dawn of time to the age of steel and circuits, the images we draw to make sense of it have shifted, from waxen slabs to parchment, from the written word to the cold logic of machines. Yet, as you wander these cerebral paths, beware the mirage of these metaphors, for they can mislead and obscure the truth.\n\nThe journey of understanding begins with the senses, those ancient messengers that transmute the raw elements of the world—touch, warmth, the tremble of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind. A symphony of signals, shaped and reshaped by the brain's arcane algorithms, in a dance of bottom-up and top-down processes. Consider the simplicity of a black box on a field of white; the bottom-up gaze discerns the lines and hues, the edges where shadow meets light, whispering to you of its form. Meanwhile, the top-down mind, wise with the knowledge of what has come before, hastens recognition, turning mere perception into understanding—a black box, not a void in the white expanse.\n\nYet, amid this torrent of perception, there stands the sentinel of attention, a guardian that chooses which whispers of thought are worthy of the mind's gaze. You look down and see not each blade of grass beneath your feet, though they are there, silently processed. But in the clamor of voices, your name, like a bright flame, calls to you above the din. Through layers of thought, this guardian of focus shapes what is seen and known.\n\nTo hold the world's knowledge within the mind, it must first be caught and kept. Memory, with its many faces—fleeting, like the sensory; momentary, like the working; enduring, like the long-term—begins with the act of encoding. Each sensation is captured in its own fashion; the spoken word is a tapestry of form and sound and meaning. Once captured, it must be held. In the fleeting moments of working memory, the spark of thought loops through its neural path, a brief echo of electricity. In the depths of long-term memory, it is woven into the very fabric of proteins, a tapestry of existence.\n\nIn the endeavor to map this realm, many models arise, each a reflection of humanity's quest for understanding. Some draw from the echoes of recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the pulse of the living brain. The semantic network, a web of concepts and connections, tells of \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" and from \"table,\" the leap to \"wooden,\" a lattice of thought across the vastness of the mind.",
            "In the year two thousand and seven, the United States found itself swallowed by a financial abyss, the likes of which it had not seen in many years. Unemployment rose like a specter, the housing market collapsed under its own weight, and the mighty pillars of American industry lay shattered. This recession grips the nation even now, demanding we ask how such ruin came to pass and how it might be averted. At the heart of it all lay the self-serving and short-sighted machinations of those in power, who pressed upon banks and firms the issuance of sub-prime loans within a frail financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pressed to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into complex instruments. When the borrowers faltered, the banks lacked the reserves to withstand the storm, and the chaos spread like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the waning days of the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure his legacy with a second term. In a bid to bolster his standing, the administration loosened lending constraints, laying bare the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfold years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the gathering storm in 1999, noting the mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to extend mortgage loans to those of modest means, even as stockholders demanded ever-greater profits. Holmes predicted the outcome of such folly: that in lean times, these government-backed entities might find themselves in dire straits, much like the savings and loan crisis of the eighties. As foretold, reckless lending led inexorably to economic calamity.\n\nThe unraveling was hastened by the tangled web of new mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations drew more sectors of the economy into the housing market's orbit. Families and financial markets alike found themselves overextended, precariously poised on the housing bubble's fragile skin.\n\nAnd burst it did, with devastating consequence. Financial titans that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves ensnared. The top investment banks recorded staggering debts, their combined mortgage obligations reaching four point one trillion dollars, a full thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers dismembered, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley forced into the embrace of commercial banking, subject to stringent oversight. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with five trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the government's aegis in September of 2008.",
            "In the quiet of a room where the light falls faint and the air is thick with the thoughts of a writer, there lies the temptation of exposition. A place where the words take form and the stories unfold, yet it is a double-edged sword. For some, it is a flight of prose, magical and captivating; for others, it is the lull that sends a reader adrift, their fingers hovering over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name. Dr. Merlin knows this too well, her voice rising in protest when the weight of too much information bears down, strangling the narrative.\n\nThe truth is, exposition is a fickle companion.\n\nReaders, wise and seasoned, know the adage: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet still, the lure of lengthy passages pulls even the best into its grip, where stories derail or drown in abundance. Exposition whispers in a writer's ear, urging them to lay bare the history, to rush through the mundane, to reach the heart of the tale. It is not unlike the fiend upon the shoulder, coaxing the author to divulge every trivial detail of each character's past.\n\nBut exposition is the telling of tales, the recounting of events in words that are too plain. In film, it is the monologue, the character laying out the tale like an ancient mariner's lament. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who speaks.\n\nSuppose you read of a heroine who met her beloved at a certain time, in a certain place; they were wed in grandeur, and her husband's life was snuffed out before her eyes. Would you expect this tale to be spun in a mere two pages, their voices scarcely heard? Surely not. An author must delve into the husband's soul, his words and deeds a testament to his love, while the heroine, in her own way, reflects the change and richness he brought to her life. When she mourns, you mourn with her; her grief becomes yours, drawing you closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, the tale demands more than the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nWriters must breathe life into the narrative, even when the urge to gloss over details beckons. Perhaps there is a new character, a man whose past is a tapestry of Air Force days, a gas station night manager's life, two marriages left behind, childless, with dreams of owning the station and a penchant for fishing. Once, he had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "The dawn broke over Columbus, Ohio, and the first murmurings of the day came through the flickering screen, the news of the world carried forth by NBC 4. There was a man, his name Shad Hostettler, from Ashley, Ohio, who had turned the blade upon his own. His wife's name left unsaid, as if her silence was her own testament. They showed his likeness, a visage of malice, the eyes of a man who knew too well the darkness within. The tale was brief, a scant two minutes of time, a story still unfolding, yet it was enough. Enough for the world to know of the evil that walked among them.\n\nThen came the story of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen years, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods, the morning's shadow upon him. No names save his own, no arrests, no suspects in the wind. The SWAT team prowling the scene like hounds in the night, their search fruitless as yet. The tale told quick and gone, the brevity of it a whisper of the world’s indifference, for he was a black man in a black neighborhood. A truth as old as time, that the world turns slower for those of darkness, a truth that cuts deeper than any blade.\n\nThere was a gunshot, a bullet that found its mark in the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber reminder of the world’s capriciousness. They spoke of where it might have happened, Crime-Stoppers offering riches for the name of the one who pulled the trigger. Five thousand pieces of silver for justice.\n\nThe skies were to weep come afternoon, the storms a promise of the day, the temperatures to cling to the low eighties, a respite of sorts. The weatherman’s voice a siren’s call to keep watching, to stay tuned for the storm to break.\n\nAnd then a robbery on Clime Road, a man cloaked in darkness, a hoodie drawn against the world. They spoke of him, his skin dark as the night, his height and weight a litany of his form, the words lingering longer than they ought, as if his color was the crime itself.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name spoken with disdain, a drug kingpin from Texas, his empire of marijuana stretching to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, 300 months, the years wrapped in numbers that seemed to stretch further than the truth. Hispanic, they said, a man marked by his heritage, though it mattered not. The world cares little for such things when it casts its judgment.\n\nAnd so the stories were told, the tales of the day laid bare, the world turning still, indifferent to the lives it held in its grasp.",
            "In the realm of financial instruments, the ETF stands like a lone sentinel upon the plains. An exchange traded fund, it is, crafted to mirror the ebb and flow of an index, a commodity, or perhaps a basket of assets akin to an index fund, yet possessed of a singular flexibility, for it moves upon the exchange as a stock might. The ETF offers the broad sweep of diversification found in an index, yet retains the singular charm of stock ownership, granting the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold in one's hand as few as a single share. Though these attributes glisten with the allure of promise, their expense ratios remain modest, far beneath the weight of the common mutual fund. Yet, not all is without cost, for a commission is the toll exacted upon any trade, as if one were dealing in the stocks of old. \n\nThe breadth of ETFs is wide, a tapestry of funds unfurled across the market. And in this, the savvy traveler in the world of finance must ever question, must ever seek if the proclaimed benefits, such as diversification, stand true in the harsh light of scrutiny, and to what extent they hold. Our endeavor here is to examine the ETF known as IHF, to lay it against those top ten holdings that form its backbone, to weigh if the single ETF stands in the light cast by a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks, and if there be configurations yet untried that might yield an optimal balance, a sharper return.\n\nIn this undertaking, the burden of examining each holding in its entirety would be a cumbersome beast indeed. Thus, we consider only the top ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below lie the top 10 holdings, each a piece of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these ten stocks serve as the face of the ETF IHF, we may turn to the current % of assets, brought to a unity of 100%, and from this, derive the contributions of each stock to the Beta and Return of a portfolio composed solely of these ten, each in the measure the ETF has ordained through its holdings. The calculus of Beta and return is laid bare in the chart below.\n\nFrom the figures, one sees clearly that a portfolio with but the top ten holdings boasts a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a rise of 16% in returns. It is also clear that the Beta of these ten is .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. The findings thus suggest that a portfolio trimmed to these ten holdings might yield a greater return with diminished Beta. Yet, there remains the whisper of doubt, the question if the means of these two portfolios stand apart, truly distinct from one another.\n\nTo probe this matter, to discern if these portfolios are as different as they seem, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock among the top ten, each brought to the same measure of 100%, to compare their collective standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the cold breath of winter, the numbers fell away like leaves from a dying tree. A campus in New England, the air biting and cruel, saw the logs of commuters dwindle in the third month, a sharp decline that seemed to echo the silent halls and empty paths where once footsteps trod. December, the month where the world turns inward, brought with it final flurries of schoolwork, grades, and the weight of a year closing. The days slipped away, and with them the memory of the commuter log, lost amidst the rush and the hush of the holiday's onset. A break, a pause in the cycle, where the students and faculty vanished into the month-long void, leaving the campus hushed in their absence. \n\nThe spring would come, as it always does, late in January, when the world begins to thaw and life resumes its relentless march. Yet, February lay like a shadow, unexplained in its emptiness, a mystery of missing numbers. Perhaps it was the nature of things, the way a fire burns brightest at the start and then fades to embers, that saw this project wane. In March, there came a reckoning, a challenge to stir the ashes—Carpool Challenge Week—a desperate bid to breathe life once more into what had nearly faded. And indeed, the logs rose again, a testament to the struggle against the inevitable, against the ebb of engagement and the fickle nature of interest.\n\nYet there lay another struggle in this, one that ran deeper than mere numbers. The road calls with its freedom, its independence, the car a symbol of autonomy deeply rooted in the soul of the people. To tempt them away, to lure them to another path, required more than mere entreaties. Prizes were offered, tokens of encouragement: gift certificates, small treasures for local indulgences. But what if there had been more? A bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car—a dream to chase, a spark to ignite the drifting interest. The prizes remained static, unchanged through the journey, but had they grown, had they offered more, perhaps the tide would have turned in December, perhaps January would not have felt so desolate. The thought lingers, the what-ifs dance in the shadows, and one can only wonder what might have been.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon a collection of early Edison films, a trove of moving pictures that seemed to whisper of a time long vanished. Among them, the trick films held my attention, fifteen in number, spanning the years 1895 to 1901. These were not merely films but illusions spun from the loom of creative editing, each frame a sleight of hand. My study lingered there, tracing the poetic form of these cinematic conjurings, noting the divergences that marked the later reels with a kind of evolutionary boldness. At the turn of the century, the trick film sat bound within its stage, framed by the stoic proscenium, the camera still as stone, capturing the world in long and medium shots, adhering to the creed of one shot equating to one film. Yet, some dared to defy this rigid doctrine, weaving in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nThe films were held in a shared embrace by their setting—a fixed interior, a proscenium view that rooted its essence in the theater, in the flickering world of vaudeville and magic shows. The camera, a sentinel in its place, did not stir to follow the dance of figures or objects. This immobility was a hallmark of the age, a tether to the theater's past, where the stage was the world entire. In these frames, the actors moved only side to side, a lateral ballet with no voyage toward the lens. Take, for instance, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the performers entered from the right, tracing their paths along a horizontal script. Even as they slipped beyond the frame's edge, the camera remained steadfast.\n\nThe proscenium's gaze favored the long shot, occasionally bending to a medium, but never closer, never a whisper of the close-up. This was the theater's doing, a tradition where the audience beheld the whole, framed by the stage's borders. The actors, anchored in the middle ground, ventured no nearer, and so the close-up remained a stranger.\n\nIn the main, these early trick films played by the rule that one envisioned shot equaled a film, confining their stories to a minute's breath, shaped by the frames per second. This brevity curtailed the narrative ambition, the films becoming more akin to vaudeville's quick tricks—magic, vanishments, transformations—brief spectacles without a tale to tell. Yet, the notion of one shot in the viewer's eye was but an illusion; a single \"shot\" could be a tapestry of many, stitched together to conjure apparitions or make bodies vanish. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), among the first of its kind. To the viewer, it seemed a seamless vision, but look closely and see where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" takes its cue, a revelation in the guise of a singular shot.",
            "In the old bones of the Gothic Novel lies a contradiction, an oxymoron of 'Old-New' as Ian Watt lays bare in his exploration of this literary breed. This Gothic form, both scorned and revered, accused of shallowness and celebrated for its terrible grandeur, took its first breath in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Here was a weaving of the ancient with the so-called modern, a birthing of the proto-Gothic that forged a new tongue for telling tales. Walpole drew from the ancient stage, from the mimicry of the world in 'modern' narratives, to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre stood draped in echoes of medieval stagecraft, of towering architecture, of old ways and rites. Even as The Castle of Otranto saw the light, 'gothic' was a word worn by many styles and eras, seen as relic or crude in the face of modern strides in society and letters. Yet in that meeting of theatrical Gothic with the new novel's form, where characters' minds lay bare to the reader, the Gothic endured, living and dying anew to readers far from its genesis.\n\nOne theme that wound tight through Gothic novels was chivalry. That medieval code, the shaping of a knight, found both echo and change in The Castle of Otranto. To those Gothic scribes, chivalry was a beacon, a symbol of brave and noble knights, a dream lost in the mire of their own times. Through chivalry's lens, the Gothic past became a golden age, a romantic ideal to mend the present. Walpole, caught in the storm of politics and shadowed by claims of injustice, perhaps saw in the Gothic age a purity lost to his own. This thought took shape in his characters, like Frederic, who bore the chivalric mantle. Before Frederic steps from the page, he is painted with the strokes of a bygone knight, a prince, scarred by tragedy, thought slain by infidels. This \"gallant and courteous Knight\" stands larger than life, a figure drawn in excess, a harbinger of the Gothic's future form.",
            "In the ghostly corridors of commerce, where shadows of goods traverse the earth from the whispered wants of the customer through the raw sinews of creation, there lies the tale of supply chain management. Born in the year of nineteen hundred and eighty-two at the hands of Keith Oliver, a soul given to consulting, this tale speaks of the orchestration of needs and wills, of time and place, all to sate the hunger of the market with a cold efficiency. Six are the pillars that hold this spectral edifice aloft: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is upon these that the managers of business lay their weary hands to summon forth service to their kin, the customer.\n\nProduction, the first whisper in this chain of shadows, is the bedrock upon which all else is built. It is the questioner, asking when and where, why and how all must be wrought from the earth. The manager, a seer of sorts, peers into the market, that great oracle, to divine the desires of the masses. Once the runes of demand are cast and the market's heart revealed, decisions are made as to what shall be brought into the light and in what number. The where of it, the place of birthing, is chosen with care, the plant that shall nurture the goods to meet the demands and desires of the world. With place decided, the burdens of scheduling and the maintenance of the great machines fall upon the manager's shoulders. Each detail must be a thread in the tapestry, lest the whole unravel and precious time and gold be lost to the winds.\n\nIn the days when I labored under the roofs of Wal-Mart and Target, I saw these designs, these books of process, each a scripture of order from the garments worn by the worker to the rhythm of trucks arriving with their burdens. Such outlines bring a clarity where confusion might otherwise reign, a map through the labyrinth of commerce.\n\nThe second pillar of this shadowed realm is supply. Here lies the strategy, the decisions that shape the very bones of a facility, the alliances forged with other hands to strengthen the weave. A product may have many faces and many homes, each division with its own tools and craftsmen. It falls upon the manager to discern the best path, the best division for each task, or to seek the hands of others beyond their walls. It is velocity they seek, that swift dance of quality and adaptability, all while keeping the wolf of cost at bay.\n\nThus is the tale of supply chain management told, a tapestry of decisions and designs, where each move echoes through the halls of commerce, forever shaping the shadows upon the land.",
            "In the vast tapestry of Victorian literature, the threads of detail and aristocratic focus weave a common pattern. Yet, in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the weave frays and twists into something other. Here lies mystery, a penchant for the bizarre, a departure from the expected that breathes depth into their characters, revealing souls laid bare by the winds of their peculiar worlds.\n\nIn the shadows of Oliver Twist, there lingers a passage where bewilderment reigns. \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nSuch dreams and waking nightmares cloak Oliver Twist in a shroud of enigma, revealing the boy's heartaches and the shadows that lurk around him. As Oliver revisits the moment of his shooting, reality bends to dreams, and in that bending, a truth emerges. The world around him, a maelstrom in which he is but a leaf, carries him without his will. The hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit echo through the fog of his mind, and the pain of his wound becomes a constant, a companion in fear rather than surprise. The question of whose hand guides this fate rises like smoke, for it is not Oliver's own. This incident is a testament to his powerlessness, his inability to wrest control from the grip of fate, even when life hangs by a thread. A whisper of defeat creeps into the narrative, the shadow of Fagin's influence casts long over the boy, carving acceptance from despair, dulling his will to fight. Else he might have struggled, if for nothing more than survival.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\n\nIn these pages, the day and night are as phantoms, slipping through the fingers, leaving the characters adrift in their wake. Such is the nature of this Victorian mystery, a departure into the unknown, where the heart is laid bare, and the soul finds its voice in the shadows of its time.",
            "In the years gone by, I found myself bound in the duty of guiding young minds in the hours after school had ended. Small souls gathered there, each wrestling with their own particular trials in the realm of letters and numbers, but it was the written word where I found my own strength lay. There was a boy, Adrian, a lad no older than ten who found himself at odds with the act of reading. The letters on the page confounded him, some he pronounced as if they were old friends, others as though they were strangers he had never met. He was a child of Latino heritage, yet his English rolled off the tongue as naturally as if he were born to it. We stumbled through the morass of incomprehension until the day I crossed paths with his mother. She came like a shadow into the small room where I lingered with a few stragglers, my charges for the afternoon. The woman spoke only in her native Spanish, a tongue I knew but little of, yet we managed to bridge the chasm of language between us. It was then that the truth revealed itself with the weight of certainty: Adrian could read, but the English script was an unfamiliar terrain to him. Whether this revelation served to aid him I cannot say, but the hope remains that he finds himself on surer ground now.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the chasm that exists in the schools, particularly in a place such as California, where tongues are as varied as the colors of the sky at dusk. It is a reminder that the struggle with language is often hidden beneath the surface, that even a child whose speech flows with ease may find the written word a formidable adversary. The question that arises is what course to chart from here? For Adrian, it was a matter of guiding him through the intricacies of English pronunciation and the alphabet. Yet for the multitude who scarcely know English, the journey is fraught with greater complexity. The answer is not singular or simple. The dual language system, immersion in the mainstream, private guides, classes for those learning English as a second tongue—none alone can surmount this barrier. The path lies in the weaving together of all these threads.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not only for those whose first breath was in Spanish but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" the words echoing like a prophecy. There is fear and whisperings that such endeavors squander resources, that the many will find no gain. But these are lies. Were we to embrace such methods as the rule and not the exception, all would reap the harvest. But how to proceed? Shall we decree that all who teach must speak in two tongues? No, that is a dream too far. Yet, what hinders us from bringing forth aides and tutors, those who walk in both worlds and can guide others across the divide?",
            "From the time we're young, they tell us there's something grander than us, something beyond the grasp of our understanding. Some go to Sunday school, others to Temple, and some dig deep within themselves for answers. Many of us take up the faiths handed down by our kin. Yet, there are those who turn their backs entirely, denying anything exists beyond their own narrow world. We might cling to one set of beliefs only to later cast them aside for another. Whatever path we tread, we're seeking to carve out a piece of who we are through our own spiritual lenses. We search for a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favored bird. We sat on the front porch, the rain beating a rhythm on the tin roof above, both of us with cigarettes in hand. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants lined up along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part lost in memory. He'd grown frail in those past months, his clothes hanging loose from his frame. His hair, too, had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. His eyes stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine. A loneliness settled in, a fear that kept words trapped inside, for speaking them might make it all too real. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in staring into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father left this world in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his pain but stretched his days past what the doctors had foreseen. What worth was there in suffering longer, I couldn't say. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I whispered no prayers. If God was there, I figured He'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to watch him slip from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't bear witness to the end of the life that gave me mine. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to bear witness to his end. I curled up in bed, buried myself there for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo call ever came.",
            "In the time when the land lay unburdened by the weight of history, John Taylor of Caroline stood as a sentinel of Republicanism, carved from the very soil he tilled. An agrarian by heart and trade, his brief foray into the realm of politics left a mark of resolute conviction on the pages of governance—a voice that rang clear in the defense of the individual's liberty and the rights of man against the encroaching tide of authority. His allegiance to the agrarian creed shaped his thoughts like the furrowed lines of the earth, bearing seeds that would sprout opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary, each one tethered to the notion of a pastoral ideal.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a canvas unmarked by the hands of tradition, a place where the architects of government could craft something pure and untamed—a self-governing Eden. He held firm to the belief in natural rights, those intrinsic to the human spirit, each one knotted to the other, a tapestry that would unravel if even one thread was pulled. Such rights, he declared, must remain beyond government's grasp, for in the untamed state of nature, it was the cunning and the strong who reaped the spoils. But in civilization, this must not be so.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor reckoned, a government must be wrought that embraces the dual nature of man—his capacity for both light and shadow. To him, the morals of government were but a reflection of man's own virtues and sins. He spoke of good principles, those that safeguarded the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and fended off the specter of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles could endure, he argued, even under the sway of self-interest, that perpetual engine of human endeavor, so long as it did not gnaw at the foundations of the common good to fatten itself upon others. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's innate darkness, ever watchful to prevent the taint of vile principles.\n\nIn chorus with his fellow Republicans, Taylor demanded a Constitution interpreted not loosely but with the precision of a craftsman's hand. He envisioned a Federal government circumscribed by the explicit words of that sacred text, wary of the expansive beast that might grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he warned of the perils in an interpretation devoid of the framers' intent, for such a path was fertile ground for corruption. In his eyes, the Declaration of Independence stood as the true testament of the Union, a covenant that spoke of a confederacy of sovereign states, not a singular nation bound by fetters unseen.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast down, the world narrowing to the scene before him, yet his mind remained a vast blank canvas. The gaze was steady, devoid of emotion, a practiced detachment that absorbed every detail without assigning meaning or context. Thoughts came and went, ephemeral whispers, barely settling before they vanished, leaving behind the purity of perception untainted by conscious reflection.\n\nOnce, an artist he knew had suggested a book, a tome called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, an offering that promised to unlock the mysteries of form and line. Since childhood, a desire to capture the world in graphite and charcoal had lingered within him. The book spoke of framing, of taking a world too intricate to grasp and reducing it to something manageable—a bowl of fruit, isolated from the chaos of kitchen and dining room.\n\nYet, as he stood, eyes fixed on the vessel before him, the mental frame eluded him. Overwhelmed, he could do nothing but stand in silent testament to the spectacle laid out. Like Picasso lost in blue or Monet awash in green, he stood on the cusp of an artistic revelation—his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers, delicate in their task, found the tool of his craft. Muscles tensed and released, guiding his hand in fluid arcs, a dancer's grace in the execution of necessity. The water churned, a crystalline ballet, carrying away fragments of the scene. Once more, his hand found the lever, a nervous urgency propelling the motion, but the obstinate form resisted, anchored to the porcelain depths.\n\nHe stood, mop in hand, feet planted as if to weather a storm, the green tie a noose around his neck. A frown creased his brow as he regarded the offensive castoff, a message of sorts from those who frequented the Rite Aid restrooms, a testament to the labors of those who cleaned. After several attempts, each one a meditation on futility, his hand reached to the side, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it thickly around his fingers until it became a crude glove. \n\nHe straightened, then bent once more, the hand descending into the bowl with the slow inevitability of a ritual, like a pilgrim's hand reaching into fire for a sacred relic.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of consequence young lives are snuffed out behind the wheel. Factors converge in a grim symphony, a deadly vector for the freshest faces of American roads. The National Institutes of Health lay bare the truth that the adolescent mind is a realm unprepared for the dark ballet of driving. Inexperience lies coiled at the heart of it, a serpent in the garden, birthing not only fatal crashes but a litany of rollovers, reckless speed, and the inevitable veering from the road's edge. \n\nAmongst their peers they fare worse, as any soul with a mote of sense might reckon they would, wandering in packs as is their wont. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted the link between the age of those carried and the frequency of their misfortune on the asphalt. \n\nCalifornia and her sister states have tried to weave a net of safety, granting only provisional licenses that bind the hands of the young, setting limits on the hours they may roam and forbidding the carriage of other minors. Yet such measures are but stopgaps, mere patches on a yawn of an abyss. The youngest among us are, by every accounting of statistical markers, ill-equipped to wield the weight of such responsibility. \n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a psychologist who peers into the workings of the young mind, posits even eighteen years is too tender for a regular license to drive. In USA Today, Zuckerman’s research speaks of a common lust among those not yet nineteen or twenty, a hunger for the thrill of risk. It stands to reason then, that driving should be delayed, the itch of thrill-seeking allowed to wane. \n\nIf we persist in issuing licenses to these young fledglings, the roads will continue to drink deep of their blood, and the toll will rise to towering heights. By the year of 2010, the offspring of the Baby Boomers will be of age to grip the wheel and a legion of new teen drivers will unfurl upon the highways. \n\nLegislation to address this is a simple enough affair. Let the schools keep to their classrooms, teaching the ways of the road, but let no one under eighteen command a vehicle. A provisional permit, yes, before a full license, and let there be a reckoning of hours spent learning the craft behind the wheel. The number of hours, a figure drawn from the states’ own books, like California with its six hours of direct training and fifty hours in the company of an adult. The grim ledger of teen driving stretches across this land, and thus a uniform national law seems a reasonable means, a shield to guard the youth from themselves. Such legislation is no new dawn, but perhaps it is a lantern in the dark.",
            "In the quiet reaches of the mind where sound is meant to find its way, there lies a disorder, a tangled skein of miscommunication. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it. Or Auditory Processing Disorder if you prefer your terms less ensnaring. It's a discord in the brain's symphony, where the central nervous system fails to harmonize the notes that wander in from the outside world. A condition not of the ear but of the understanding, where the music heard does not translate to the music felt.\n\nThe disorder's tale begins in the mid-century past, a time when children with voices trapped within sought release. They called it auditory imperception then, a name as cumbersome as the disorder itself. Italian minds—Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari—cast their nets wide over the mystery in 1954, and by '61, Kimura introduced a new lens, dichotic testing, a means to unravel the physiology of perception. The story unfolded further in '77, when minds gathered to press forward the understanding of children thus afflicted.\n\nIn its myriad manifestations, CAPD whispers confusion into the ear. A person may find themselves adrift in spaces where sounds drift aimlessly, unable to anchor their source. Discrimination is a task unfit for such ears, as the cacophony of the world layers itself indistinguishably. Patterns in sound become enigmatic, speech loses its tonal depth, sarcasm slips unnoticed beneath the waves of conversation. Sounds overlap, one masking the other, and the sequence of auditory events becomes as indecipherable as an ancient script.\n\nDiagnosis, elusive as it is, requires a tapestry of observation and testing. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists—they all take their turns at unraveling the disorder's mystery. They watch, they listen, they question. But no single tool exists, no definitive test to hold the truth aloft. Instead, they challenge the ears with a multitude of sounds, seeking the patterns hidden within the chaos. Advanced methods probe deeper, recording the echoes within and measuring the soul's response to its own dissonance.\n\nIn this world of sound and silence, the disorder remains a shadow, its cause a whisper lost on the wind. But in the pursuit of understanding, there is hope, a light to guide those who find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, searching for the shore.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I find myself drawn along a path leading to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to cast a light for children shadowed by abuse and neglect, and to offer solace to families adrift in turmoil. The values I bring to this field are not mere attributes but the very bedrock of my being: service, respect, an ethical compass, and a dedication to fostering relationships and honing my craft to remain steadfast and competent. These are not simply the tenets of social work; they are the marrow of my own soul.\n\nThere was always a yearning within me to aid others, yet the path was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and college, I saw many souls lost to the fog of denial, some seeking refuge in ways less than ideal. Witnessing such trials, I embarked on a journey to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the road ahead lay obscured, and so I paused after stepping forth from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, under a sun that bore witness, I visited a friend and met a boy of sixteen, his form tense upon her couch. He had come seeking refuge from an existence marred by abusive parents. The next day, the law was summoned to his home, and I went there, driven by a need to help. Speaking to the officers, I shared my concerns, and they listened as I told them of my education. They asked if I might speak with the parents. Their words were laced with unease, painting their son as a manipulator who sought intervention for what they claimed were mere trifles. It was in this moment, amidst the tangled truths and half-lies, that I realized my calling lay in social work, to aid those ensnared by such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, holds its place among my values. As a society, we raise a lament for the lost yet cling to traditions that stifle the very individuality we claim to cherish. If we mourn the lost, why do we chase sameness? I have never found comfort in such confines. Throughout my days in high school and college, I stood against the tide of social injustice: coloring my hair against convention, clothing myself in garments that sang of my spirit, piercing beyond the norm, joining the GSBA to declare my stance, fighting against the specters of racism and discrimination whenever they reared their heads. I believe in justice's cause, and I will continue to champion it against the dark.",
            "In the gloom of the scholarly inquiry, there lies the study of insomnia, the affliction that haunts the night with its silent pallor, and the paper before us seeks to unravel its mysteries through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model, with its roots deep in the hereditary soil, examines the genetic tapestry and medical nuances woven into the fabric of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the worldly bonds of environment, race, ethnicity, and the stark demarcations of demographic and socioeconomic boundaries. In this review, the shroud is lifted from insomnia as these models are laid bare, each piece of research dissected to illuminate the models, and then scrutinized, their strengths and frailties laid open to the world.\n\nThe realm of sleep, where disorders creep unseen, can be divided into primary sleep disorders, those tied to mental disquiet, and those born of other maladies. Within the primary lies Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while disorders linked to mental discord trace back to Axis I or Axis II afflictions. Still others rise from medical tribulations or the shadow of substances. The Dyssomnias—Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others—stand as sentinels of disrupted slumber, each with its tale of woe. Primary Insomnia, the thief of rest, and Primary Hypersomnia, the relentless sleep, both linger for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its specters of cataplexy and automatic REM, joins them in this dance of unrest. While Dyssomnias battle with the onset and maintenance of sleep, Parasomnias arise from behavioral and physiological anomalies, with nightmares and terrors as their harbingers. The disorders bound to mental discord, tied to Axis I or II, weave a different story. This review, however, turns its focus to insomnia, a solitary beacon amid the primary sleep disorders, as it relates to the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nIn the biological sphere, the whispers of genes and the echoes of heredity intertwine with the physiological chorus of sleep disorders. Within the hypothalamic shadows, neurons harboring orexin hold the reins of slumber and wakefulness. A study, with mice as its earthly avatars, discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, guardians of sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor, when called to arms, ushers in sleep, yet if silenced, it quells anxiety and beckons rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, though drawn from the world of mice, hint at echoes in the human realm, whispering of a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor. A flaw or absence in this receptor might mar one's ability to grasp sleep's embrace without aid. The sociocultural echoes of this study suggest that an inherited phenotype could dictate the dance of sleep, and any disruption in the receptor's song would ripple through life's tapestry, casting shadows on school, work, and the mundane tasks that require unwavering focus.",
            "He'd been wandering the paths of University Park now for what seemed like an eternity, though in truth it was but two and a half years, or four and a half semesters if one counted by the calendar's reckoning. In those early days, finding his way from place to place had been a trial, an ordeal of distance and weather. His first year had seen him lodged in a dormitory at the far eastern edge of the campus, beyond which lay only the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, great monuments in the emptiness. From his sanctuary in Stuart Hall, the journey to places like Willard building, set near the heart of the campus, stretched to an ungodly twenty-five minutes on foot, the trek made worse by the capricious weather that seemed to haunt State College.\n\nHe'd spoken with those who'd come before, alumni not much older than himself, who spoke of a time when the halls in the east were cut off from the rest of the world by vast barren lands. Those lands were now swallowed by sports fields, grand edifices like the new Creamery, and a health services building, all encircled by a sprawl of apartments. As the campus swelled and spread, so too did the difficulty of traversing it. The question that loomed like a shadow was how best to navigate this ever-growing expanse. The answer, simple yet profound, lay in the humble bicycle. Yet a bike alone was not enough; it needed the will of the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nHe'd spoken with a friend, one who had returned to cycling after a long absence. His friend marveled at why he had ever given it up. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.\" In his words lay a truth as clear as the morning sun. Bicycling, in its simplicity, was the most efficient path. A bowl of oatmeal and the push of the legs could carry a soul thirty miles or more. Living off campus now, as far-flung as any dormitory, he'd come to see the wisdom in owning a bike. Each day he faced the prospect of reaching the Thomas building, a place that by foot would consume a quarter of an hour or more. Yet astride his bike, the wind in his face, he could reach it in five if he rode with purpose. The road that beckoned, Pollock Road, was the most direct route, though not without its challenges. Walking had its merits, but time was a commodity he could not afford to waste. Without his bike, the walk to Thomas would steal away thirty or forty minutes from each day, amounting to more than two and a half hours of lost time each week. Time he could not spare, for life was a tapestry of classes and appointments and other obligations that demanded his presence. He knew then, as he knew now, that the bicycle was not merely a means to an end, but a companion on this journey through the wilderness of education.",
            "In the pages of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley crafts a vision where the looming shadow of technology and the capitalist scaffold it rests upon cast a pall over humanity. The world he spins is one where the individual is subsumed into the mass, where the pursuit of fleeting happiness is the creed learned from the cradle. The people, mere pawns in a grander scheme, are held in thrall by a singular doctrine decreed by the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's lurking doubts about the paths these systems have hewn. Words like homogeny and reification, borrowed from Marxist discourse, underscore the novel's critique of the nascent economic order of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist concept. The common folk, their eyes blindfolded to the true ties that bind them to other classes, chase after their own gain, oblivious to the strings that control them. This ideological dominance over the proletariat and the everyday laborer is starkly portrayed in the conditioning of Brave New World's denizens. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, move through life without volition; their slumbering minds echo with the chants of consumption and indulgence, all orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the total domination of social classes by a separate few, is evident here. The lower classes, blissfully ignorant, invest in an ideology that props up the very structure that enslaves them—capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, possess the awareness but seldom act, save for a few like Bernard who stir against their chains. The interplay of these social strata offers a window into capitalism's perceived yoke.\n\nIn this brave new world, true connections between souls are but a mirage. Characters meld into a faceless throng, even those of prominence, their depths unexplored. Perhaps Huxley whispers of a world where technology and capitalism, hand in hand, strip away man's will and voice. Love is a ghost, emotions muted to dull hums; interactions are but surface ripples, evident in the men’s idle prattle about women’s physical traits, the pneumatic allure, and the women’s unabashed recounting of their liaisons. The classes' contentment with their station speaks to the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles mirrors Marxist reflections on the proletariat, lulled into believing their supremacy as long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "Four years past, I found myself in a course on Islam at CBC, a place of learning where discourse ran hot like the sands of some ancient desert. The question that flared bright among us was whether Islam bore hostility in its heart. This inquiry feels ever more pressing in the shadow of years since the towers fell. I have watched the tides of media shift from angered waves casting Islam in shadow to a strange tide of acceptance in this land of ours. In those days of 2001, could we have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage, rising to seek the mantle of leadership?\n\nThe tale of the Prophet, it calls to me with its contradictions. What history tells of Muhammad seems at odds with the portrait painted in the pages of his life. I had been taught that Muhammad was a man who wielded faith as a weapon, subduing tribes beneath the banner of Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, a figure misunderstood and humble, gathering followers by truth alone. They came to him, it says, drawn by the light of his teachings.\n\nAnd there are echoes here of another story, of Jesus and the miracles wrought in his time. The Prophet, it is said, took mutton and milk, multiplying them to feed forty souls. Such tales, penned to show Muhammad as a humble prophet of miracles, seem to me a theft of the divine story of Christ. It is as if they cloak the life of Jesus in the garb of another, seeking to borrow the light of his deeds.\n\nThe biography spins many tales of conversion, of souls turning to Islam by their own sight. Yet these are stories told through layers of voices, each a whisper from another's lips. This chain of hearsay, meant to lend truth, leaves me uneasy. It casts doubt upon the tale, like shadows on a moonlit path.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood. They speak of him as gentle, wise, and humble. But history's voice tells of a different man, of a rise to power marked not by gentleness but by force. I wonder if those who follow him now know the true story that lies beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the passage of time, the teachings of Jesus seemed to vanish like whispers in a storm, left behind as the tides of Christian thought surged forth. As one gazes upon the sprawling canvas of history, a picture emerges of a faith that has drifted from its moorings, its origins obscured by the dust of ages. Our present world, with its burgeoning awareness and fervent march toward progress, stands in stark contrast. Tradition clings to the hearts of some, those who guard their inherited truths with unyielding fervor. Yet, their numbers may not suffice to sway the collective course. Among believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken in the years to come. A restless hunger will arise to peel away the layers of doctrine accreted over time, to uncover the essence of what the Nazarene intended. It may span decades or centuries, but the tide will turn inexorably. A great unwinding will occur in the annals of Christian history, a reversion to the wellspring of its inception. A movement will gather strength, stripping away the accumulated dogmas as if time itself were reversing, leaving only the purest vision of what Jesus imparted to humanity, unmarred by the claims of later thinkers. When this wave sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes into its embrace, the church will remain, a steadfast beacon to guide the way. Yet, as theological time rewinds, the vast diversity that has flourished within Christendom will yield to a growing unity of belief and practice. Where once divisions lay between regions, denominations, and sects, there will emerge a tapestry of shared convictions. History is replete with reversals of fortune. Recall how Christians, once hunted and reviled by the Roman Empire, later saw that empire don the mantle of their faith. Our nation has journeyed from the bondage of African-American slavery to the heights of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, unraveling history's tapestry to seek its source, diminishing diversity in the process. It is vital to recognize that this transformation will hinge on a reading of Jesus' words as metaphor, not as literal decree. What, then, transpired since the days of Jesus? If we cast our gaze far enough back, we find only Judaism, the theological seedbed from which Christianity sprang forth. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures formed the bedrock by the time Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Yet, even among the Jews, unity was scarce. They fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a multitude of common folk, each with their own spirit and path.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle lies the truth of man’s nature, a revelation of greed and self-interest that festers deep within. An exposition of souls eager to clutch only at their own desires, blind to the plight of those beneath them. The tale unfolds amid the great ironworks and factories, where the owners and overseers are consumed by the lust to grow their empires vast and unyielding. They care not for the lives crushed beneath the wheels of their progress, their eyes cast only forward, oblivious to the ruin left in their wake. As Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the pollution pouring forth, an indifference to the harm inflicted upon man and beast alike. The smoke, a river of despair, the waste from the pens a testament to their disregard.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the relentless machine, toil under the lash of commerce. Their lives weighed against the almighty dollar, their worth less than the coin that buys their labor. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The hours are long, the breaks nonexistent, the threat of dismissal without warning a shadow that hovers ever close. In this time, this era of unchecked power, the law offers no shelter. The owners unleash their demands with impunity, the laborers driven faster, the conditions squalid and unforgiving.\n\nNo agency stands to offer aid, no voice to call out the injustices. The unions, twisted in their purpose, prey upon the very men they claim to protect. Sinclair’s words cut deep, revealing a population caught in the grip of a merciless machine. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A slavery of a different kind, no less harsh, no less consuming. The men and women of Packingtown, bound to their fate, their lives a testament to the cruelty of unchecked ambition.",
            "In the shadows of a world half-remembered, there lies a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, a piece he held in some esteem, called \"Dream-Land.\" Within its woven lines, the name \"Thulé\" rises, a specter from both Virgil's pen and a further origin, more recent yet no less ethereal. Virgil spoke of Thulé, a distant isle, a whisper at the edge of the world known to ancient Greeks. Yet Poe, a man drawn to the currents of German thought, found another source, a voice that beckoned from beyond the veil of time. \n\nThere is a tale told by Karl J. Arndt, of Poe's dance with the ghost of Goethe. In Arndt's telling, Poe's verses echo those of Goethe, a mimicry or perhaps a homage. The Oxford Companion whispers of Goethe, a master of words, his Faust a crown of poetic drama, split across the years, the first act in 1808, the second as Goethe himself passed into the shadow in 1832. Amidst this magnum opus lies a sliver of verse, \"The King of Thulé,\" a lament of loss and a goblet heavy with memory. A king bereft, drowning in drink, and at last, casting his last tie to the world into the sea before following it into the abyss.\n\nThe king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" mirrors this tragic monarch, a shadowy reflection in a world of half-light. Poe, a soul perhaps haunted by loss and the numbing balm of the bottle, saw in this tale a kinship. Less than a year before he penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invoked Thule, a word like a talisman, twice in his collected works. In \"Dream-Land,\" Thule bookends the tale, a dark twin to Goethe's king. The landscape painted in Poe's verses is one of desolation, a haunted land where specters of lost friends roam, a realm stripped of color.\n\nPoe's admiration for Goethe, if not directly, was perhaps filtered through his esteem for Tennyson, a poet of great regard. In the echoes of Tennyson's verses, Poe might have heard the refrains of Goethe, a melody carried on the winds of literary creation, in the many iterations that surfaced after the original had been cast into the world. In those lines, the shadow of Thule looms, a place both real and imagined, a bridge between the realms of the living and the dead.",
            "In the quiet aisles of the grocery store, under the indifferent watch of fate and the fluorescent glow of the overhead lights, an applesauce spill lay waiting. A customer might wonder if such an innocuous event could unravel into something larger, something with consequences that stretch beyond the simple act of slipping and falling. For Jennifer Palmer, it did. She found herself entwined in a narrative of negligence and disregard, a tale told not by words but by the actions of a manager who turned a blind eye.\n\nPaul Martin, the manager, had been informed. Once, twice. The applesauce spill was not a secret, hidden in the shadows. Rich Wayne, a dutiful employee, brought it to light at five in the afternoon, and again, Mary J. Haddigan spoke of it. Each time, Martin's response was the same, a dismissive shrug, a preoccupation with his dinner, the mundane over the immediate. By half-past five, Jennifer Palmer lay on the cold, hard floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's indifference.\n\nIn the courts of California, they speak of malice. Of actions taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm they might cause. They speak of despicable acts, of conduct so far removed from the common decency expected of mankind that it demands retribution. Palmer would argue that Martin's knowledge of past injuries, his awareness of the peril the spill posed, should have stirred him to action. Yet, like the indifferent hands of a clock ticking away the minutes, he let the danger persist.\n\nThe question was not whether she could claim her due for the injury sustained, but whether she could reach beyond the tangible and claim punitive damages. For in California, to breach an obligation, to act with oppression, fraud, or malice, is to open oneself to the weight of justice. And Martin's actions, or lack thereof, might well be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of others. As the statute reads, malice might not require intent to harm but merely the willful ignorance of potential harm.\n\nPalmer's tale was not of a single fall, but of a pattern, a series of incidents ignored. In 2009, five slip-and-fall incidents had already marked the history of D&D Markets, and yet, Martin's actions remained unchanged. The narrative of negligence wound through the months, leading inexorably to Palmer's fall. And now, she stood on the precipice of justice, the law as her guide, seeking not just compensation, but a recognition of the wrong inflicted by Martin's callous indifference.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the courts will hear her plea for punitive damages, whether they will see in Martin's actions the malice required by law. But in the gathering shadows of the courtroom, as the echoes of past judgments linger in the air, one thing is clear: the story of Jennifer Palmer and the applesauce spill is more than a simple tale of injury. It is a testament to the power of accountability, a reminder that actions, no matter how small, can have consequences vast and far-reaching. And that justice, though sometimes slow, is relentless in its pursuit.",
            "She had always felt as if there was something she needed, some yearning etched deep within her bones. It was a longing that refused to be quelled, a desire unfulfilled. It began when she was about fourteen, just stepping into the threshold of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years on at the age of seventeen. By now, she had come to know it was not a thing she craved, but a someone. Yet no boy stirred her interest. There were those who had been drawn to her, stumbling through their awkward rituals to charm the uncharmable, but none found her favor. She often questioned herself, pondering this oddity, searching for reasons why such a strange thing would plague a girl her age. Years of contemplation had birthed theories, but none held enough truth for her to dwell upon. So she lived her life, a constant interrogation of her own desires.\n\nHome was a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle folk, calm and untroubled. They never quarreled, not with each other, and seldom with their daughter. The only discord arose from her pursuit of independence, her free spirit clashing against their quietude. She was a daughter born of placid stock, yet she countered their tranquility with her vibrant personality, making her quite likable alongside her inherent kindness.\n\nToday, however, peace was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, a short scream pierced the air, her mother's voice, once lovely, now strained. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the kitchen. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, breathless. Her mother lay crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face, each breath an \"Ow\" escaping her lips. Her daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words came in gasps, squeezed out through the veil of agony. \"Okay, Mom, tell me how I can help.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital awaited with its scent of antiseptic and fear, a place where sickness held court. Yet she was blind to it all, her mind consumed with the task of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly, calling out for assistance. Faces, etched with worry, converged around them. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, wheeling her away for examination. The girl was left alone, seated in the waiting room, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase hidden in the highest cabinet, a simple misstep that had brought them here.",
            "In the quiet pursuit of understanding what lay beneath the surface of human frailty, a study set out across the land to uncover the mysteries of the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet as it came to be known. Word carried that this way of living, mirrored in a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, held promises of guarding against the harsh grasp of chronic heart disease and stroke, and even the shadows of stroke mortality. This aMed diet, a variation upon the Mediterranean theme, spoke of a life rich in the bounty of the earth—plant foods and their proteins, fruits and nuts of the land, grains whole and legumes. It favored the warmth of olive oils over the cold of saturated fats and asked for the creatures of the sea over those of the land. It allowed for modest toasts with wine, for it did not demand asceticism.\n\nThe old tales of prior studies whispered of a bond between the Med diet and a lesser burden of death, both total and of the heart. One trial, like an ancient saga, showed this diet more potent than the path of low-fat living, helping shed the weight of flesh and balance the blood's humors. Yet in the past, the focus had not lain upon the specter of stroke or its lethal kin.\n\nThis tale followed the journey of 74,886 women, bound by the Nurses' Health Study, wandering from their youth into the autumn of age, with no history of cardiac or diabetic ills. Over two decades, from 1984 to 2004, they bore witness through their own words, self-reported visions of their feasts upon questionnaires designed to capture the essence of their dietary past year by year. In this passage of time, more than ninety-five in a hundred remained steadfast. The tales they told were verified against the hard truth of records and certificates, though some stories, lacking proof, were deemed probable, and so they entered this chronicle—tales of stroke and heart's failure.\n\nTo see clearly through the haze of chance, the scholars took the scores from the aMed diet, each a whispered echo of years past, and averaged them, seeking a true reflection of long-term fidelity to this diet. They adjusted for life's many confounding paths: age, the smoke of tobacco, the heaviness of body, the hormonal changes of womanhood, the intake of vitamins and spirits, the vigor of one's leisure, and the use of aspirin.\n\nThey employed the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, their way of seeing the unseen threads linking aMed scores to the risk of heart and stroke, separating the fatal from the nonfatal, each type its own story.\n\nIn the end, the tale told of women who walked the path of the Mediterranean diet with fidelity, who bore higher aMed scores, and who found themselves less burdened by the specter of heart disease and stroke. Over the span of twenty years, there appeared 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 deaths from the silent killer of cardiovascular disease. Those women who stood in the highest quintile of aMed scores faced a lesser risk than those in the lowest, their relative risk a mere 0.71. Thus, the story passed into the annals of time, a testament to the power of the Mediterranean way.",
            "The sign bore the words like a dire whisper from another age. Hitler is alive in Burma. On the corner of the street stood Ellen Page, the actress from Juno, solitary with her placard held aloft. The letters scrawled in Sharpie ink told a tale of unsettling portent. Burma, the land known also as Myanmar, lay in the grip of a brutal militant junta. They had seized power in the year 1962, a coup d’état that cast a long shadow over the nation. The year 2007 saw the streets swell with the first protests in a decade. The monks, clad in robes the color of saffron, led the charge. The Saffron Revolution, they named it, for the hue of their vestments. The populace began to stir, to rise, and the junta soon met them with violence. It was like war. A war waged upon the peaceful, the monasteries stormed by soldiers. Foreign journalists were snatched from the streets, imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty for bearing witness. Official reports spoke of 13 dead, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, whispered of a hidden carnage. “The bodies can be counted in several thousand,” he said.\n\nThis tale is old as time. Governments, since the dawn of civilization, have sought to crush dissent, to hold dominion over their people. The emperors of Rome claimed divine favor for their reign. In Japan, emperors were seen as gods incarnate, leading their people with technology and ritual, and our own president, George W. Bush, spoke regularly with Ted Haggard, who led the Stupid People Worldwide under the Republic Party’s banner.\n\nTales of such tyranny are like shadows cast long across history. The June 4th protest of 1989 at Tiananmen Square comes to mind, where students and intellectuals, laborers and visionaries, gathered to defy the government's iron hand. The numbers of the dead are as disparate as the stories told, the Chinese government speaking of hundreds while the Red Cross whispered of thousands more. Then there was Rwanda, in the 1990s, where the Hutu militias, with the government's aid, began their grim work, the systematic slaughter of the Tutsis and any who dared to moderate. And the specter of Hitler's Third Reich, a shadow that fell across nations, a time of terror for those of Jewish descent, speaks of the extremes to which such power can reach.",
            "In the dim corridors of jazz history, the figure of Duke Ellington rises like a shadow cast long by a setting sun. His presence, a subtle whisper behind the keys, speaks less of the man himself and more of the vast tapestry he wove. A tapestry where each thread, each note, each pause, bore the weight of his genius. Ellington, the silent architect, built cathedrals of sound where the voices of his orchestra soared. In the spaces he created, soloists found their freedom, their voices unfurling like banners in the wind. Yet, beyond the improvisations, there lay a precision, a structure woven tight as the skin of a drum, calling forth the specific hues of his band’s timbre to paint his musical visions. His mastery lay not only in the individual notes but in the grand symphony of souls he orchestrated, each player a vital part of the luminous whole. \n\nThe pages of the Grove Music Dictionary speak of Ellington’s sound, his innovation, as they whisper of the Creole Love Call. In this composition, Ellington’s voice, devoid of words, becomes a color, a texture, a spirit inhabiting the air. It is an early testament to his vision, where voices meld with instruments in a dance of sound and silence. The call and response, a dialogue between voice and reeds, unfolds in the slow pulse of a twelve-bar blues. Each chorus, a chapter in a tale told without words, sings with the raw clarity of life itself. The muted trumpet’s lament, the clarinet’s high cry, the full band’s echo—all converge in a crescendo before settling back into the primal call of voice and reeds. Here, the voice growls, an instrument unto itself, before a trombone’s dissonant mutter brings the tale to a close.\n\nIn the year that followed, as the world turned and the notes of Hot and Bothered filled the air, Ellington’s genius continued its quiet revolution. The call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing intertwines, a dialogue of soul and spirit, of flesh and wind. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) carries this conversation forward, where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone becomes the voice of the earth, grounding the melody in the eternal dance of sound and silence. In these compositions, Ellington’s legacy is not merely heard—it is felt, a pulse beneath the skin, a whisper in the dark.",
            "In the silent corridors of time, where life etches its relentless march, a question lingers like smoke in the hollow of a long-forgotten chamber: why do creatures evolve the way they do? Are there unseen chains that bind and guide the hand of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in the year of 1917, mused upon this and remarked how the language of numbers had yet to capture even the simplest forms that dwell in nature's realm. A sentiment not yet outgrown even by our modern age. Yet, with the passing years, the art of mathematical modeling has been cast upon the spiral shells of mollusks, tracing the lineage of their form through the eons, as Raup and Stanley once did in 1981. Herein, we embark on a journey, a study, to unearth how these mathematical whispers, spoken in the growth and evolution of Prunum, can unravel the mysteries of their becoming. Through the eyes of X-ray, we chart the bones of their shells, setting parameters that the mind might use to dream both of what is and what could be. These numbers find voice in the program CerioShell, a creation of Stone in 1995, conjuring shapes that might dwell within the bounds of what is possible. And alongside these phantoms, experiments and observation weave their tale, seeking to illuminate the grand tapestry of life's change.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a journey—a tube winding its way through the vast compass of time and space. Each turn, each curve, is a whorl spiraling around an imagined axis, the columella, steadfast and true. The pace of its dance varies, and where each whorl meets its next is marked by a suture, a line of demarcation. In the end, it is the largest whorl, the body whorl, that stands as the crowning chapter of its story. The spire, it is called, all whorls save for the last, with the apex a beacon at its tip and the base its anchor. Through an aperture, the creature within peers out, extending into the world beyond.\n\nThese shells, they can be seen from many eyes: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common gaze is apertural, with the opening toward the eye and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nTo count these whorls, one must begin from above, from the apical view. There, the first suture marks the beginning, and from it, a line is drawn to cleave the shell into two. Whorls are tallied from this line, estimated to the quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell, it is a series of doorways, moving through the tapestry of time, as the creature builds its home around itself. One might trace this path, marking the center of each aperture, measuring its breadth and height.\n\nIn this dance of creation, numbers are woven, and once the figures are known, the shell's genesis can be altered, its story rewritten in the language of mathematics.",
            "In the dim lands of Indonesia, where the sun sets upon the archipelago and the night gathers close, the little lives of newborns flicker in the shadows, unmoved by the turning years. The tale of their survival, of mothers too, is a story writ in numbers, a litany of promises unmet. The aims of the Millennium, those lofty goals, loom unfulfilled while water runs clean and the earth is washed of its stains. Yet the hearts of mothers and the breaths of babes still falter in their quest for life, their hopes not yet measured against the mark set for them by time’s unyielding hand.\n\nIn the villages and towns, where the cries of life begin, there are hands that catch and hands that fail. Seventy-two in a hundred now know the touch of those skilled in the art of life’s beginning, yet still, the old ways linger. The midwives, with their ancient wisdom, cannot stave off the blood’s dark tide when it rises, and so the death of mothers is a sorrow all too known, the loss a testament to what yet needs doing. The numbers speak of progress, yet they lie in their silence, for the work remains unfinished.\n\nThe children suffer too, their small bodies wracked by the old foes of water and waste. The healers who once came now come less often, and the care they need after birth is but a shadow, a whisper lost in the wide expanse of this land. The cut that saves, the surgeon’s knife, is a stranger to many, its edge rarely felt. In the cities, it finds its place, yet in the fields, it remains but a rumor, a story told in the hushed voices of women who walk the long road to hope.\n\nAnd in this place of disparity, where the rich find solace in the arms of medicine, the poor stand outside, their hands empty, their pockets bare. The choice that lies before those who would change this tale is a stark one: to carve out a path for each ailment or to weave a broader tapestry that holds all in its embrace. The allure of focused work is bright, its goals clear and its rewards swift. But the cost is high, for to choose one is to forsake another, and the balance tilts, leaving some in shadow.\n\nIn this land of islands, where the sea binds and separates, the question remains: how to care for the mothers and the children, how to bring light to the places where the night has long held sway. It is a question of choices, of paths untaken, of a future yet to be written in the lives of those who wait for the dawn.",
            "In the annals of time stretching back a century, popular music has unfurled into a tapestry so vast and intricate that to name each thread is a fool's errand. The strands of genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each birthing a multitude of offspring, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a lineage unending. Among these, the branch of Heavy Metal stands, a colossus in the realm of popular sound, evolving and shifting over the last four decades into a beast most diverse and expressive. Its voice is a chorus of emotions, a symphony dwelling in the shadows. From its nascent cries, the genre revealed a malleability, a clay in the sculptor's hand, giving rise to myriad forms, each more intricate than the last, until the present where the lines between them blur and fade.\n\nIn this modern epoch, the heavy metal landscape is a labyrinth of niches, each with its own tongue and lore, so much so that the essence of metal itself eludes definition. It is an amalgam, a mingling of echoes from distant genres, yet it remains a creation with roots. To grasp the metal that reverberates through today’s halls, one must seek the heart of the metal movement, for it is not merely a genre but a force, a revolution.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in shadow. It is a symphony of excess, an anthem of more—more bass, more volume, more fury, more spectacle. A departure from the primitive, it demands skill, mastery, and those who wield it, they possess a prowess that bleeds into the music. Metal is a journey down paths of altered states, a testament to the psychedelic haze of the mid-seventies when minds unfurled and creation knew no bounds, the music transcending into realms unknown, drug-fueled and unapologetic. This was music that embraced the visceral, the dark, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that dominated before. The legacy of such darkness finds its roots entwined with the Romantic Era, a time when shadows danced upon the stage of art. The words of songs, like those found in Helter Skelter, speak of this darkness, a descent into chaos that marked the Beatles’ foray into the heavy, a retort to the Rolling Stones, a declaration that they too could walk the paths of shadows.\n\nThus, the tale of metal unfolds, a narrative of darkness and excess, of mastery and movement, echoing through the corridors of time.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would lay their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, crafting his own dreams with the patience of a man who knew them precious. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, stands as a testament not only to a woman's wonderment at a land conjured in sleep but also to Rousseau’s own longings, the visions that drove his brush. Since he first took up the craft, he sought not just to paint but to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold of artists and those who marveled at their creations. Yet this path was not without its trials, a struggle within his heart, torn between the safety of imitation and the wild, uncharted lands of his own imagination. The Dream is a canvas of this struggle, an embodiment of Rousseau's battle to either mimic the styles that might grant him acceptance in the eyes of the art world's elite or to set forth on his own, carving a path through the thicket of his own creativity.\n\nTo ponder The Dream in this light, one must wander back through the story of Rousseau himself. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, northwest of France, his life began not with the strokes of a brush but in the hands of his father, a tinsmith by trade, who knew the comforts of a modest prosperity (Shattuck 47). No academies opened their doors to Rousseau in his youth; instead, he toiled for the nation, a gabelou in the toll service, though those who spoke of him often erred, calling him a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight of his children, left him with but one daughter, Julia, and a sorrow as deep as the ocean (Shattuck 49). In painting, he sought refuge, a new beginning in the colors and forms that might offer solace. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romantic hues, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams as humble and earnest as those of his kin.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's yearning for acknowledgment within the art world is to see it for what it was, a natural longing. He was a man who came late to the canvas, untrained by the formalities of art schools, painting in the shadow of giants. It was only as Matisse began to be whispered about in the circles of art that Rousseau felt the first glimmer of recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon draws a line between the two—Matisse, who feared nothing more than the mundane in art, and Rousseau, whose dream was to create a work so pleasingly conventional that he might gain entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the vast wilderness of thought where the great minds roam, there lies a path that winds between ethics and beauty, truth and their mirrored reflections. Like the words etched upon the ancient urn that Keats once pondered, beauty and truth are intertwined, bound in a dance as old as time itself. We learn much in this life through the schooling of books or the harsh tutelage of experience, yet the appreciation of what is moral and what is beautiful seems innate, a knowledge unspoken and untaught, whispered to us on the winds of existence. These are not matters of dictation but of revelation, a quest to uncover the why behind the art or the act, not the how.\n\nCritics might gather around da Vinci's Mona Lisa, speaking of light and shadow, the stories held within each brushstroke, yet at the heart of it lies an enigma unsolved, a whisper of something beyond words. When one speaks of a cherished tale or a painting that stirs the soul, the explanation often begins with that elusive phrase, \"There's just something about it,\" before reason takes its ponderous course. The essence of art and morality slips through the fingers of analysis, leaving behind a residue of the infinite. As O'Connor so rightly put it, a story is the vessel for what cannot be simply stated, a bridge to the unsayable. The spirit of a tale lingers beyond its telling, just as ethics speaks in silence, transcending the bounds of language. As Wittgenstein mused, ethics dwells in the realm of the transcendental, echoing the same ineffable quality that art possesses.\n\nIn the realm of the unseen, where the noumenal lies, as Kant might have described, is where art and morality resonate most deeply within us. These are felt rather than explained, touching us in places where words falter. Literature, with its woven tapestry of words, stands apart, carrying the weight of moral truths like no other art. It is here where the threads of life and story intertwine, where the values lived and the values written are one and the same. In literature's embrace, we find reflections of ourselves, the truths we hold and the truths we seek, as crucial to our being as the air we breathe or the paths we tread.",
            "In the days long past, before the world was as it is now, there lay a land called Germania. A place neither bound by a single name nor a single tale. It stretched out from the cold Baltic shores down through the dark forests and rising alps, a land of shadows and quiet might. From München's alpine watch to Kiel's windswept edge, a whisper of its culture lingered, a tapestry woven from countless threads. The Rhine bore witness to Köln, and the Elbe cradled Dresden, each city a note in a long-forgotten song. A nation united now from the remnants of many tribes and peoples.\n\nThe scholars and historians debate still from whence the name Germania was born. Some speak of Tacitus, who named the Tungrians as the first of the Germans, those who once stood against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his writings of conquest, called them “Germanus,” a name borrowed from the very Gauls he subjugated, a mark to distinguish the unconquered from the conquered. The records tell of battles fought across the Rhine, of skirmishes and wars waged by those fierce tribes. A name whose root is tangled in language, perhaps from the spears they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout echoing in the din of war.\n\nIt was Tacitus who penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in the year of our Lord 98, writing of the Germans, those who seemed to him untouched by the mingling of races. He spoke of them as aboriginal, their land a wild and inhospitable place, where skies wept cold and manners were sullen. Who would forsake the warmth of Africa or Asia for such a realm unless it was their own? \n\nAnd yet, the Romans did not abandon their empire for Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking out its riches and its men to serve under the eagle's standard. The tribes lived on the empire's edge, trading their wares and their strength, a borderland where cultures met and mingled, but seldom mixed. The Romans ventured forth, but always returned, leaving Germania as it was, a land of mystery and might.",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its web, a tool of deception stretching long and thin, but in the end, the masquerade must be cast off. For a soul risks losing its own reflection should it cling too tightly to the mask. Yet, to unravel such deceit is to chance a solitude, the self set adrift from the harbor of kinship. One must choose then, between the preservation of the self or the tethered bonds of those around. For there are those who might shrug off the trickery with indifference, while others might feel the sting of betrayal, the charade a bitter pill.\n\nWhen the cloak of disguise wraps itself around the guise of gender, it stirs questions deep as the night, questions of why one would bury their true self beneath another’s skin. Viola, adrift in a foreign land, dons the garb of a man, a shield against the unknown: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Her ruse spares her but at a cost, severing her from the sisterhood of women, a lifeline cut short. Her deception is so complete that Olivia, bewildered, sees her as Sebastian and love’s folly ensues: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Meanwhile, beneath the surface, there stirs a forbidden longing with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nIn the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tapestry of hidden truths, whereby deception lays bare the desires buried deep, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The play whispers of unspoken longings, brought forth by the presence of Viola under the guise of Cesario. Does Olivia's heart truly leap for Cesario's male facade, or does it harbor a secret yearning for women? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia serves as Shakespeare's jest, a mirror of those who judge by appearance alone. Her swift affections, turned from Cesario to Sebastian, reveal a heart easily swayed, her regard for Cesario/Viola shifting to sisterly kinship: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "In the vast expanse of history, there are shadows cast by empires long fallen, and among them, the German colonial rule stands stark in its memory of harshness. In the arid lands of South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the echoes of genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people speak of a brutality unmasked. Yet, to paint the entire German colonial endeavor with a single brush is a folly of simplification. The empire, sprawling across distant lands, mirrored the complexity of its geography in its disparate policies and governance. \n\nWhen the British seized control of German East Africa in the year 1919, they unearthed a landscape rich with educated souls. In the classrooms of Tanganyika, minds had been nurtured under a German sky. Kamerun, too, bore witness to scholarly praise, the efforts of the educators resonating through time. \n\nBut South West Africa told a different tale. There, beneath the relentless sun, the education of the native was largely a mission of faith, entrusted to the hands of missionaries with scant support from the governing hands. The settlers' children, the European progeny, found favor in the eyes of the state. Schools were built, resources poured, and the holy mission of education was regulated and funded. Yet, the native children remained shadows in their own land, untouched by the light of knowledge, wandering in the dark of ignorance.\n\nThe soil of South West Africa bore the scars of decisions made long before. While other colonies could count their learned, in these lands, the silence of illiteracy reigned. The reasons for this stark divergence are writ in the annals of social and political forces, the attitudes of settlers and rulers alike shaping a destiny. This tale seeks to unearth those buried truths, to sift through the sands of time and bring forth understanding.\n\nIn the dusty tomes of history, the story of German colonial education unfolds, penned in the language of its origin. Scholars of a bygone era sought to chronicle the systems of learning that spanned the empire. Later voices, speaking in the English tongue, broadened the discourse, laying bare the contrasts between these far-flung territories. Among them, Cohen's words stand prominent, comparing the schools of South West Africa to those of East Africa, unraveling the threads that weave their differences. Cohen speaks of the settlers, their numbers a force that shaped the educational path of South West Africa.\n\nBeneath the German sun, South West Africa offered a climate more forgiving than its brethren lands, yet its heart was a desert, unforgiving and vast. By 1913, the white settlers numbered nearly 15,000, their presence a testament to the land's relative hospitality. In East Africa, the numbers dwindled, a mere 5,336 calling it home, the next largest contingent in the empire's fold.\n\nThus, in the corridors of history, the tale of German colonial education in South West Africa unfolds, a tapestry of contrasts and complexities, echoing through the ages.",
            "There was a time when the United States and Mexico stood as adversaries, their rivalry stretching over the long span of fifty-seven years, from the year 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by strife, a time when the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848 reached its fevered pitch. The United States, in its relentless pursuit, laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the grip of Mexico. The clashes between these nations were many, a tide that waned only with the approach of the First World War. At the heart of this conflict lay a chasm of differences—religion, culture, tradition—each a stone in the edifice of their discord, each a source of material strife.\n\nThis tale of two nations is not unlike the tales of others, nations bound by borders and bound by the rivalries those borders breed. For where lines are drawn upon the earth, so too are lines drawn in the hearts of men. David M. Pletcher speaks of this, saying that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems,\" for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the United States, while others in the Latin expanse have found a different fate.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, cast its shadow between the two nations, a rift that has long haunted the annals of history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in the days of old, Americans stood opposed not to fascism or communism, but to Catholicism and monarchy. It was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War's contest of wills, but here the struggle was rooted in the soul, in the beliefs that each nation held dear. This distrust was not born anew but inherited from the colonial past, a legacy of the English and the Spanish, a barrier to the peace that might have been.\n\nDiehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes within that span of rivalry, disputes that echo the cries of border raids and frontier upheavals. Bandits and outlaws, marauders of the border towns, were a scourge until at last, the United States and Mexico took up arms to secure their borders. Yet with time, the rivalry waned, as Schmitt observes, for Mexico grew reliant on the United States, and the ambitions of America turned away from conquest of land to the allure of economic entanglements in Mexican soil.\n\nAnd so the tale of rivalry softened, the years of strife yielding to a new era, an era where the shadows of the past lingered still but no longer cast their darkest pall.",
            "Fifteen years past and the world had turned brittle beneath me, taken by an illness unknown, a shadow without form or name. I was a nurse then, a choice born from a hunger for the safety I’d never known in childhood. The words were a chant in my youth: you’ll always find work; folks will always fall ill. So it was I walked a path not my own, my dreams of science and stories left to wither, tending instead to the sick and the weary.\n\nYet there I stood, forty-six years gone, alone, the coffers empty, no work to grasp. The years unfurled, living on the mercy of Social Security, each day a struggle against the dark tide gnawing at my soul. Certainty had fled, but truth remained—without family and a few steadfast friends, I’d not have endured. Disaster, when it comes, strips strength to the bone and leaves you hollow.\n\nLife’s course is fraught with storms, some small, others sweeping. No promise holds forever, and though we prepare, some burdens are too great to bear alone. We in this land of ours must turn from the crumbling promise of government’s hand, moldy and frayed, and find in each other the strength we crave. Trust must be reborn, a hand offered in both giving and accepting aid, not each of us alone behind walls of stone.\n\nThe rugged spirit they speak of, that built this place, was not borne of solitude but rather the thread of compassion and shared toil. Those who crossed the Rockies did not find the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo gather your provisions, as I have mine—kits for disaster, supplies for healing, water to be made clean, and windows to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their power, candles and matches to light the darkness, stores of food to ward off hunger’s call. If land is yours to till, let it yield sustenance. A wood stove stands ready for those not bound by city walls.\n\nYet amid your preparations, do not forget the faces around you. Reach out, learn the names of those who dwell beside you.",
            "In a time long past, in the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince came into the world, destined to be known as Buddha. A man who would cast away the trappings of his princely life to walk the path of enlightenment. His teachings, like seeds scattered in the wind, took root and grew into what is now called Buddhism. Among its branches, the oldest and most unyielding is Theravada Buddhism. This faith, stretching back some twenty-five hundred years, has shifted and morphed through the ages, its visage now different from when the Buddha himself walked the earth. These changes are apparent everywhere, in places like Sri Lanka, where the waters are cut by ceremony each year. Monks and lay folk both partake in this rite, which holds a weight of belief despite never being spoken of by the Buddha himself. Such transformations ripple from surface rituals to the very essence of the faith's doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist fold, both those who don the robes and those who do not, have seen their guiding principles change, swayed by tides both internal and external, both harsh and gentle.\n\nTo speak of these shifts, one must grasp the terms of the discourse. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhasasana's own ranks, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, by contrast, hail from those outside the Buddhist fold. Those forces that bear hostility seek to tear at the fabric of Buddhism, born from eyes that regard it with malice. Yet there are also forces indifferent, benign, which neither wish harm nor aid, though they may do one or the other inadvertently. These terms will weave through our tale like threads in a tapestry.\n\nWe must first turn our eyes to the heart of the faith—the doctrines at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Believers seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma finds its voice in the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka cradles the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the laws that bind, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical depths. Here lie notions of Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the ever-present suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara’s end, so too shall end the trio of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when enlightenment is reached. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out rules for life. For the common folk, there are five precepts: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from theft, from sexual misconduct, and from intoxicants. For those who wear the saffron robes, the rules multiply. At the faith’s foundation lie the four noble truths. First, the acknowledgment of Dukkha, the suffering that life brings. Second, the realization that attachment is the root of suffering. Third, the belief that suffering can indeed be overcome."
