            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed corridors of negotiation, culture stands as a silent arbiter, its presence felt in the spaces between words and the pauses that punctuate a conversation. Culture, elusive, defined as much by absence as presence, is neither monolithic nor singular. To declare all Russians obstinate or all Japanese yielding is to paint with a brush too broad and too simple. The wise negotiator perceives the contours of a culture not as unyielding barriers but as landscapes to navigate, understanding the subtle shifts and undercurrents that might sway the discourse at hand.\n\nTo enter the realm of another's culture is to see through the lenses of one's own, to draw comparisons that come unbidden. The path to understanding winds through history and prejudice alike, and judgment finds no purchase here. One must accept the world as it is, negotiate within its bounds, especially when one's footing is unsure, when the ground is unfamiliar. On foreign soil, respect for what is sacred and enduring becomes a bridge over the gulf of difference, guiding the players towards common ground.\n\nCulture, like a river, does not cleave neatly along national banks. Within the walls of a company, a culture of its own takes root, shaped by the hours demanded, the clothes worn, the words spoken or unspoken. Corporate culture, too, has its rituals, its codes, its silent agreements. Across the American landscape, from one corporation to the next, from urban sprawl to suburban quiet, diversity of thought flourishes. Where some cultures present a smoother surface, seeming uniform to an outsider’s gaze, they invite a deeper delve into the hidden depths below.\n\nTo grasp the essence of a culture is to understand the values that animate it. If a culture prizes honor or the harmony of the collective, a negotiator will guard against shaming his kin in the pursuit of victory. In contrast, a culture that values the hard bargain will not rush to a swift settlement. These truths are the backdrop to the play of negotiation, a stage set before the first words are spoken. Yet, beyond the broad strokes of culture, it behooves the negotiator to seek the man behind the mask, to understand the person across the table, for therein lies the key to fruitful dialogue.",
            "In the dim chambers of thought where men ponder the divine, two voices rise, ancient and solemn. The first belongs to Anselm, who speaks of God as a certainty within the heart's confines. He whispers that the divine does not wander in the realms beyond but dwells within, a truth unshaken by the winds of doubt. God, he says, exists in our understanding, so deeply wrought that to think Him not is to tread a path of impossibility. Anselm beckons us to seek not beyond the shadowed walls of our own soul, for there lies the proof, untouched by the world's clamor. Faith, he names it, this knowing without seeing, this light in the dark where reason falters.\n\nYet there comes another voice, that of Aquinas, who walks not by faith alone but by the hard stones of reason. He bids us look to the world, to the change and causation that mark its passage, to the degrees of being and the harmony that binds it all. He lays before us five paths, each a thread to the divine, spun from the fabric of logic itself. In this tapestry, God is not a whisper of the heart but a necessity of the mind, a piece in the puzzle unseen yet undeniable. To Aquinas, the world itself cries out the existence of God, needing no leap of faith but only the clear gaze of reason.\n\nAnd so, these two stand, their voices mingling in the echoes of time. Each speaks of God, yet in their telling, the divine wears different garbs. One whispers of faith's quiet certainty, the other of reason's steadfast march. And we are left to ponder their words, to wonder if the truth of God lies within or without, or if perhaps it is woven from both, a mystery both seen and unseen.",
            "In the world of letters, there are many ways to cast a shadow or a light upon the themes that haunt a story. Some methods strike deeper than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, he crafts his tale with a deft hand, employing a tapestry of techniques to evoke a sense of feeling or mood. At times, Fitzgerald marries words in a way that would seem strange, an adjective clinging to a noun, painting a scene with an aura all its own. Other times, he breathes life into symbols, colors that pulse with meaning. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink—all take on a life in his story. In his tale, Fitzgerald shapes the essence of these colors, white and gray, red and pink, folding them into the narrative like a subtle reminder of something felt but not seen.\n\nThe hues of white and gray become a canvas for uniformity, white tinged with a sheen of class, gray with the weight of age. From the story’s first breath, these colors whisper their meaning. Daisy and Jordan move like specters in their white dresses (8)—white is the color of choice. Nick dons white flannels (41) for Gatsby’s revelry, Tom’s shirt is white when he meets Myrtle (36), and Catherine’s face is powdered a milky white (30). When Nick surveys Gatsby’s party, the garish splash of primary colors breaks the spell of white (40). Fitzgerald casts white and gray over the ordinary, the mundane: the “white chasms of lower New York” where Nick toils (56), the names at Gatsby’s fêtes reduced to “gray names” (61), Catherine’s home a mere slice in “a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28). Common folk and places wear these hues as if they were a uniform: the “white girlhood” of Jordan and Daisy (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” of the valley of ashes (23), the “Italian child” steeped in gray (26), the dog-seller an old gray man (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sown the seeds of meaning within these colors, he turns them upon the characters, signaling their insignificance or conformity. Daisy becomes a specter in her “white” roadster, a ghost of desire that Gatsby chases (74). She fades to the background, a uniform shade against which longing is thrown into relief. The “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash (115), all serve to remind the reader of her spectral form, a figure made of longing and loss.",

They seek to marry the ancient whisper of the earth with the new hope of profit and purpose. \n\nYet, the path is not easy. Organic farming demands of the farmer what the earth demands of the seed—patience, labor, the willingness to nurture without the easy crutch of chemical aid. The land takes its toll in time and effort, each weed and pest a challenge to be met with hands and heart. The cost is high, the losses sometimes heavy, and the small farm stands alone against the might of larger foes. But there is beauty in the struggle, a richness in the diversity that blooms where chemicals dare not tread. \n\nThis landscape, this 160-acre sprawl of chaparral and oak, grasslands that whisper of the Mediterranean, this is where the dream takes shape. It lies at the border of the Cleveland National Forest, a breath of wilderness in the East County Southern Foothills. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its shadow here, a guardian of over a hundred voices of the wild—plants and creatures, some teetering on the brink, others already lost to time's relentless march. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies and birds, all hold their fragile court here. \n\nOnce, this land knew the tread of Native American feet, the lowing of cattle, the steady ring of axes hewing wood. It was homestead and livelihood, a place where hands shaped the earth for survival. Now, it waits for new tales to be written in its soil. I sought out this land, this place of possibility, and through the lens of a real estate screen, I imagined what might be. I found a farm, organic and hopeful, nestled in the same land, a beacon for what might come to pass.",
            "In the world, there exists a bond between brothers that is as immutable as stone and as binding as the earth itself. Within this bond lies a tumult of emotions: love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, emotions that weave through their lives like the roots of ancient trees. Brothers, they know each other as no other soul could, seeing themselves reflected in the eyes of the other. It is in the moments of deepest despair that the true nature of this bond surfaces, revealing its face whether it be benevolent or malevolent. And in such revelations lies a steep cost. To truly grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link, one must face the consequences they drag in their wake. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not through the lens of others but as he truly is. It is in the actions they take and the aftermath of those actions where their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers tread this path, exploring the tumultuous emotions that bind them. Through a landscape lush and vivid with life, they embark on a journey doomed from its inception. In the final act, bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride, leaving only one brother to walk away. The theme is drawn out through the stark characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, seen through the narrator's eyes, communicating the complexity of feelings that envelop the protagonist's world, shaping his every deed.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a singular force: pride. From the outset, when he first ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated outing, pride festers within him. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart his worldly skills, like holding his breath and running and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such fantasies crumbled to dust in the face of Doodle’s frailty. Born with a heart as fragile as spun glass, it was a wonder he survived at all, and to partake in such vigorous pursuits was beyond the realm of possibility. For the young protagonist, with his head full of dreams, such a revelation was a crushing blow. In his anger, he even contemplated the unthinkable act of smothering the life from the small child beneath a pillow. What kind of child entertains the notion of infanticide? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle bestows upon him a simple smile. A gesture so small, yet it kindles a flame of hope within him. His conviction, it seems, was never as strong as he believed, for deep within, there lay a primordial affection for his brother.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a wonder stands cloaked in mystery. As the world spun on its axis and the days unfurled into years, the way we likened this intricate organ to the world around us shifted and turned. Once it was but a wax tablet, then a papyrus, then a tome, and finally a machine of silicon and wires. Yet in this journey of understanding, let us not be deceived by these metaphors, for they hold truths as fragile as a spider’s web.\n\nThe dance of perception begins with the world’s touch upon our senses. The caress of air, the warmth of light, the murmur of sound—they are transformed into whispers of electric currents. The brain, with its unknowable algorithms, spins this raw tapestry into a vision. Through the lens of bottom-up and top-down processes, we piece together the world. A simple black box upon a canvas of white becomes more than mere shapes and colors. It is seen and known, not as a void but as form.\n\nYet, amidst this torrent of sensation, a sentinel stands guard—attention. It chooses what to heed and what to cast aside. Though the earth and sky may teem with countless details, our mind, in its wisdom, discerns the essential from the inconsequential. Like a name called out in a bustling hall, some signals pierce through the noise.\n\nFor the mind to weave its wonders, it must hold fast to memory. From the fleeting to the eternal, it stores its treasures. Each word, each sight, is encoded, preserved in the lattice of neurons or the dance of proteins. Memory lives in layers, ephemeral as a summer breeze or enduring as the mountains.\n\nIn seeking to understand this enigma, many have ventured forth with models and theories. Networks of meaning where thoughts are linked like stars in a constellation. A chair, a table, a wooden beam—all connected in the web of the mind, each node a beacon of understanding.\n\nAnd so, we journey on, into the depths of our own creation, seeking to know what cannot be fully known, to map the unchartable terrains of the human soul.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the throes of a merciless financial catastrophe. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market crumbled to dust, and titans of industry lay prostrate in the dirt, their foundations shaken to the core. The recession holds its grip even now, and thus we are compelled to question: what dark alchemy birthed this crisis, and how might we stave off its return? The tale is one of avarice and folly, of political machinations that drove banks and firms to cast sub-prime loans into a fragile and nascent financial edifice. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those monolithic entities, were not spared the pressure; they were driven to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into labyrinthine constructs of CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers faltered, as they were wont to do, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, and the ensuing chaos rippled through the repackaged mortgages, spilling forth into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the waning years of the Clinton era, in the year 1999. The President, his eyes set on a second term, sought to bolster his standing by loosening the chains of lending restrictions, thus sowing the seeds of the sub-prime crisis that would bloom seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a portentous tale in 1999: “Fannie Mae, the nation's mighty underwriter of home mortgages, has come under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to broaden the scope of mortgage loans among the lowly and the moderate, all the while feeling the weight of stockholders’ demands for continued profit growth.” Holmes’ words, like a prophet’s, foresaw the unraveling: “The government-subsidized corporation may find itself in peril should an economic storm gather, leading to a rescue reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.” And so it came to pass, as ill-fated lending practices laid waste to the economy.\n\nA multitude of forces conspired to cast the economy into a downward spiral, among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and the dread collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) wove themselves into the fabric of the housing market, entwining financial sectors with a perilous intimacy. The U.S. households, and indeed the financial markets at large, found themselves overextended, teetering on the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest tremor in pricing.\n\nAnd tremor it did. The housing bubble, engorged with false promise, finally burst, leaving financial institutions that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities to reckon with their hubris. The five great investment banks of the U.S. stood burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for a staggering 30 percent of the nation's GDP. The reckoning was swift and unforgiving: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were driven to seek refuge as commercial banks, their wings clipped by regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in $5 trillion of mortgage debt, were finally seized by the government’s hand in September of 2008.",
            "In the telling of tales there comes a moment when the writer stands poised at the precipice of creation, wings unfurled in the vast expanse of possibility. There, amidst the weaving of words, lies the perilous ground of exposition. A place where the unwary scribe may fall prey to the siren call of verbosity, drowning their readers in a deluge of facts and figures until the story itself is lost in a fog of needless detail.\n\nBeware, for exposition is a treacherous guide.\n\nThe wise among you have learned the lesson well: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even the most learned can falter, their pages heavy with the weight of words that neither move nor breathe. For exposition is a sly deceiver, whispering that the road to understanding is paved with the stones of history, that the past must be laid bare before the tale can take flight. But heed not its counsel, for therein lies the path to stagnation.\n\nConsider the tale of a woman and her love. Told in sparse lines, they met beneath a wide and open sky, were wed in grand celebration, and in one cruel stroke, he was taken from her. Such is the skeleton of the story, stark and bare. But to breathe life into these bones, one must attend to the heart of the matter, to the words unspoken and the moments shared. It is not enough to know they loved; we must see it in their eyes, hear it in their voices, feel it in the quiet spaces between.\n\nIn the weaving of their tale, the writer must draw the reader into the circle of their lives, binding them with threads of empathy and understanding. To know the man not by the fact of his existence, but by the warmth of his smile and the strength of his embrace. To see the woman through his eyes, and in her grief, find echoes of our own. Only then can the story take root, growing beyond the page into a living, breathing thing.\n\nSo, as you set forth upon your own journey, take heed. Do not rush to fill the silence with noise. Let the story unfold in its own time, each moment a step upon the path to revelation. For in the quiet spaces, in the pauses between words, lies the true heart of the tale. And it is there that the magic happens, when the story becomes not just a telling, but a living memory, etched upon the soul.",
            "In the early light of a day born of discord, I watched the flickering screen cast its shadows across the room, the voice from Columbus, Ohio, speaking of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had turned the dark of night darker still with a knife’s cruel edge. Ashley, Ohio bore witness to his hand, and they showed his face, a visage of unrepentant malevolence. They spared but a breath on him, the tale still unfurling like some poisonous vine around the morning hour, the scant details of a life cut and an arrest made.\n\nThe story shifted to another place, another soul, Travis Buyers, eighteen, left on the brink in Sharon Woods where the sun rose slow and heavy. No arrests, no faces to put to his pain. The SWAT team prowled the shadowed streets, and yet the story was brief, too brief, and I thought of how the world moves quick past the darkened skin of a man, the tales of their suffering muted in the din. The world watches when the fair-skinned fall, their stories a cacophony, but for others, silence.\n\nThere was talk of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet ripping the air, a .22 caliber that marked its passage through metal and sky. They offered five thousand dollars for the name of the one who pulled the trigger, a bounty on shadows.\n\nThe sky brooded over the weekend, rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties. A fleeting mention, a lure to keep eyes on the screen, the weather yet another player in the day’s unfolding drama.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, the Clime Road UDF in Columbus, a man cloaked in black skin and a hoodie. They lingered on his hue, the darkness of him, as if it were the crime itself. Six feet tall, one hundred fifty pounds, a specter in the night.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin from Texas, his empire crumbled by the law. Marijuana, they said, flowing from the south to Ohio, a river of green. Twenty-five years he would serve, they said, but called it three hundred months, as if the weight of years bore more heavily in numbers. Hispanic, they named him, though what the color of his skin had to do with the tale, I could not say.\n\nThe stories spun together, a tapestry of darkness and light, the screen a window to a world as distant as it was near.",
            "In the world of markets and trades, there exists a creature known as the ETF, an exchange traded fund. It is not unlike a ghostly shadow of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, mirroring their movements but with a grace of its own, dancing on the exchange floor as freely as any stock. The ETF carries within it the promise of diversification, the spread of risk across many, yet allows you the singular command of a lone stock. You can sell it short, buy on margin, own but a single share if you wish. And in this, it offers allure. Its expenses are but whispers compared to the clamor of mutual funds. Yet, every rose has its thorn, and here you must pay a commission each time you trade it, as you would with any stock. A cornucopia of choices lies before you, as varied as the stars, yet the wise must always question. Do these benefits, these promises of diversification, truly hold? And to what extent? \n\nOur gaze turns now to the ETF known as IHF, and we shall weigh it against the ten pillars that form its foundation. We seek to know if in owning this single entity, one might touch the same heights as holding a varied portfolio of ten stocks. Or perhaps, by rearranging these same stones, we might fashion a structure with greater strength or return. \n\nTo unravel this, we focus only on the chief ten holdings, which together form 63.58% of the ETF's entirety. Here, we present these ten, their presence marked in the landscape of assets.\n\nTo understand how these ten stand for the whole of IHF, we take their current standing, normalize it to a full hundred, and thus calculate each one's offering to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were they to stand alone in the proportions dictated by the ETF's design. These numbers, these calculations of Beta and return, are laid bare below.\n\nFrom this tableau, it becomes clear. A portfolio of these ten alone promises a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a leap of 16%. The Beta too, sits lower by .12 than that of the ETF entire. It seems then, a portfolio of these ten might offer more bounty with less risk. Yet, we must ponder if the means of these two, ETF and Ten, are truly different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern this, we turn to the deviations, the measure of each of the ten's wanderings from the path, and normalize these too to a hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF itself.",
            "In the third month, the numbers fell away like autumn leaves, and when one looked to the figure, there it was, plain as day. A drop precipitous and unbidden, and hard to reckon why. When winter settles upon New England, the cold turns folk away from their bicycles and their boots, and maybe that accounts for some of it. December, a season when the fall semester winds to its end, and minds are burdened with the weight of schoolwork and grades and the myriad tasks that fill the days. Perhaps those commuter logs slipped away into the shadows of forgetfulness. Then comes the holiday, a busy time, and with it a long respite from the halls of learning, a time when students and professors alike find no need to tread upon the campus grounds. When January comes, the classes resume, and therein perhaps lies a hint to the scarcity of logs for that month. Yet February remains a mystery, its numbers low, unexplained. Perhaps, as with all projects, there is a fervor at the beginning, an energy that wanes with time. To counter this, we fashioned a Carpool Challenge Week, a surge in March to stir the embers anew, and it bore fruit, the logs rising once more. And so it was that we found ourselves grappling with the ebb and flow of engagement, the natural decline, and the breaks that punctuate the academic calendar.  \nAnother trial was the lure of the open road, the freedom and ease that come with one's own vehicle, a love woven into the very fabric of our being. Incentives were needed, and so we offered them, prizes aplenty, gift certificates to local haunts and distant chains alike. Yet one wonders how the stakes might change with grander offerings—a fine bicycle, a gleaming hybrid, an electric steed. Would such temptations have staved off the lull we faced? The prizes remained constant, but had they grown in worth as the months wore on, there might have been a difference. Gift cards served us well at the start, but had we announced new prizes in December—a bicycle or two, and then in January, the promise of a car—one can only ponder if the tide might have turned, if the logs might have swelled instead of dwindling.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon the dusty scrolls of early Edison films, each frame a whisper from an era long past. Among these, a peculiar breed caught my eye, the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These were crafted with an alchemist's hand, employing the sorcery of the cut to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My journey through these flickering ghosts was one of charting the language of trickery, noting those few that strayed from the fold as the years waned. At the heart of these films lay a steadfast adherence to a world framed by the proscenium, static and unyielding, where each film was but a single breath, a solitary shot.\n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, confined within its painted borders, the camera an unwavering sentinel, fixed as fate. It was a tableau drawn from the theater, from vaudeville, from the dusty boards where magicians plied their craft. The actors moved as if bound to the earth, side to side, never daring to approach the lens that captured their antics. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) stands as a testament, its players entering from the right, traversing the horizontal as if the world itself were but a narrow strip. Even when they vanished beyond the frame's edge, the camera held its ground, unmoving.\n\nThese films were composed in long shots, the rare medium shot a whisper of intimacy never fully realized. The close-up was an unknown land, unexplored, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville left the audience at a distance, observing the whole of the stage at once. The actors remained in the middle ground, the camera a distant observer, never inviting a closer gaze.\n\nMost trick films found their life in a singular concept, a lone shot that defined the whole. Their brevity was as a breath held, seldom more than a minute in length, each frame a flicker of vaudevillian spectacle—magic acts, vanishing illusions, transformations—bereft of narrative weight. Yet, within these films, a shot to the viewer's eye was not always as it seemed. The illusion demanded a deft hand, stitching together fragments of reality to conjure the impossible. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a cunning example, the moment of her doomed head's severance buried within the cut, a single shot to the untrained eye, yet a patchwork of frames beneath the surface.",
            "In the shadows of literature's past, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction, an \"Old-New\" conundrum as Ian Watt might have it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic form has wandered through the halls of critique, derided and praised, its depths questioned, yet its 'terrible sublime' nature extolled (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto gave birth to this genre, melding the ancient with the modern, forging a new path in the wilderness of words. Walpole drew from the old stage with its dramatic echoes and the new mimicry of nature found in the 'modern' novels to weave what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This Gothic tale hearkens back to the medieval echoes of theatre, architecture, traditions. Even in the twilight of Otranto's release, \"gothic\" was a term cast upon many peoples, styles, epochs. Seen as old, unsophisticated against the bright mirror of \"modern\" progress, it clung to its theatrical roots even as it embraced the novel's new form, allowing the reader to peer into the souls of its characters. Thus, Gothic endured, timeless yet obsolete, new to the eyes of readers lost in the web of time.\n\nWithin these Gothic tomes, the notion of Chivalry looms large. This medieval path of the knight, both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, for Gothic writers, stood as a beacon of what was once noble and brave and capable, a reflection of what they deemed absent in their world. The chivalric past, idealized, romanticized, whispers of the Gothic's future dance with Romanticism, striving to mold the present anew. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil, despaired for the days to come. Swathed in politics and shadowed by accusations, he perhaps pondered, if not openly, the loss of inherent morality, the 'goodness' of the Gothic age, now vanished in the hearts of his contemporaries. This struggle breathes through his characters, as seen in Frederic. Before Frederic steps into the light, the reader senses his chivalric aura; a prince, wounded by life, touched by tragedy, presumed lost to the infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" his image swells with exaggeration, heralding the Gothic excess yet to come (66).",
            "In the vast sprawl of commerce where the world drags its goods from one end of the earth to the other, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. This stream of processes, born from the mind of Keith Oliver in the year 1982, moves like a river that knows no rest, carrying the burdens of order from the moment a customer desires to the raw pulse of materials, through the labor of hands and machines, to the place where the goods find their peace in the hands of those who want them. There are six stone pillars upon which this edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of those who guide the chain, the managers who bend the will of the world to offer service to those who ask it.\n\nProduction begins the tale, the first note in a symphony. It is the foundation upon which all else rests, the moment when the thoughts of what, when, where, and how take shape. It demands a keen eye on the market, the silent whisper of the people's desires, a guide in the wilderness. Here, decisions are made, the future drawn up in numbers and plans, the where and the how taking form as managers ponder the place and the machinery, the rhythm of time and the wear of tools. It is a step heavy with import, each misstep a cost of time and fortune. In the world of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the design, the booklet, the process that guides every hand and every step, a map in the wilderness of commerce. It is this clarity that keeps the wheels turning, the confusion at bay.\n\nNext comes the matter of supply, the second stone in the chain. Here lie the strategic decisions, the core capabilities that define a place, the partnerships that grow like vines from decisions made. A company may split its soul, dividing the labor across many lands and hands, each with its own tools and talents. Here, the manager decides where to place the burden, which division or partner shall carry the weight. They may choose to let another carry the load, to outsource the work, and in this choice find speed, find flexibility, while holding the costs at bay.\n\nAnd so the chain winds on, a path through the wilds of commerce, each step a dance, each decision a note in the song of the world.",
            "In the grim tapestry of Victorian literature, where the minutiae of societal hierarchy often stand as the canvas, there exists a divergence in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like strange constellations in the night sky, bear the mysteries and the grotesqueries that set them apart from their contemporaries, infusing their characters with the haunted depth of dreams and enigmas. Here, motivations and emotions are laid bare as if under the light of a spectral moon.\n\nIn Oliver’s world, there is no peace. Ideas swarm his mind like spectres, and he walks not in the company of the living but with the echoes of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a discordant symphony in his ears. Even as he speaks, it is not to the world around him but to the phantoms of his consciousness. A gunshot rings out, shattering the air, and he is swept away by an unseen force, a maelstrom of sound and chaos engulfing him. Through this tumult, a gnawing pain lurks, an ever-present torment that knows no respite. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels paint the landscape of mystery often with the brush of dreams or the dreamlike, each stroke differing in its intent and revelation. In Oliver Twist, these visions unveil the hidden corridors of Oliver's soul, the shadows of his anguish, and the dawning of his understanding of the world’s cruel truths. In the retelling of his shooting, Oliver is ensnared in a vivid reverie, seeking aid in a world that spins beyond his grasp. The passage underscores his impotence amidst the chaos that surrounds him, the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit a testament to the abyss in his spirit. He is borne away, numb to the touch of the unseen hand, experiencing anew the despair born not from the sting of pain but from the fear that clings to his bones. The specter of this event raises the question of whose will guides his fate, for it is not his own. The shooting becomes a mirror to his helplessness, a reflection of his inability to seize control even as death looms. There is a whisper of defeat in this narrative, as if Fagin's shadow has begun to claim him, thrusting him deeper into a chasm of despair, shackling his will to resist. Otherwise, one might presume he would have struggled for the sake of survival, if only to grasp at life’s fleeting promise.\n\nTime ebbs and flows, neither day nor night holding dominion. Time is a specter, gone as soon as it arrives, and night descends once more; a night that stretches endlessly in its oppressive silence, yet slips away in its brief, haunted hours.",
            "In the dimming years past, I found myself in the hushed corridors of an after-school program, a haven for children seeking solace in books and numbers. Among them was a boy, Adrian by name, caught in a struggle with the written word. He was a small thing, perhaps in his third or fourth year of schooling, and the letters danced before him like shadows on a wall, some clear as a bell, others lost in a haze. He was Latino, that much was true, yet his English was as flawless as the summer sky.\n\nWe battled on, Adrian and I, until the day his mother came. I was minding the stragglers left behind from a field trip when she walked through the door. Her tongue was Spanish, mine barely so, but we exchanged what we could in broken phrases. It struck me then, like a sudden thunderclap, that Adrian's foe was not the words but the alphabet itself. He was a boy adrift between two worlds, and I wondered if my revelation brought him any peace. I hope, in the quiet moments, that it did.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light on the silent barrier that is language in our schools, especially here in California. It is a barrier unseen, even to those who speak the tongue with ease. For Adrian, the cure was simple: tutoring in the letters and sounds of English. But for others, those whose voices are new to this land, the path is twisted and long. There is no single answer. The dual language system, immersion, tutors, ESL classes—none alone will mend this tear. It is in their weaving together that hope lies.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child, but for all. Studies whisper of its success, of children who rise above their peers. Fear hovers over this notion, fear that it is folly, a waste. But it is not so. If we embraced this as the way, rather than the exception, all children might flourish. How then do we proceed? Must every teacher wield two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot place by their side aides, tutors, call them what you will, who speak in two voices.",
            "From the time we are children, we are told of things vast and incomprehensible, whispers of something greater that looms just beyond the reach of our understanding. Some are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still others search within the confines of their own hearts for the answers. Many of us embrace the faiths handed down by those before us, while some cast them aside, denying anything beyond the orbit of their own solitary universe. We may cling to one set of beliefs only to shed them for another as we wander. Whatever path is chosen, the journey shapes us, guided by our own visions of the divine. We seek a beacon in the darkness, a light to lead us from the shadows into the day.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch of our house, the rain a relentless tide upon the tin roof above, cigarettes between our fingers. The gutters spilled their burden, drowning the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a stare that seemed to reach for something unseen, part quest, part memory. He had grown thinner, his clothes draping his frame like a forgotten memory. His hair, too, had waned, sparser than I recalled. He avoided my eyes, gazing into the rain as if it might offer answers. I felt the solitude of that moment, fear clinging to me as I realized I could not speak of how much I would miss him. Words would give weight to the reality we both wished to deny. I embraced him, drew my chair nearer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father departed this world in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased his pain, merely stretched his days beyond what the doctors foresaw. I pondered what value lay in such suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered in the solitude of night. I uttered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased to heed my voice long ago.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. So I did not. I could not bear to watch the life that gave me breath as it flickered out. I wanted to hold the memory of his living, not his dying. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin. I knew he would not want me as a witness to his end. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nAnd no one even called.",
            "In the early days of this great land, there was a man named John Taylor of Caroline, a soul deeply tethered to the soil, who spoke with fervor for the cause of Republicanism. Though his hands were calloused by the plow, his brief brush with the relentless winds of politics shaped him into a figure known for his steadfastness and his voice, ever rising in defense of the liberty of men and the governance that would allow it. His creed lay in the furrows of the earth, for it was the agrarian life he held above all, believing it to be the noblest of pursuits, and it was this belief that painted his views on the nature of sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the courts of law.\n\nTaylor held within him a vision of a land unshackled by the chains of history. He saw a nation where the absence of ancient traditions was not a void but a canvas to inscribe a new order, a self-governance that could stand as a beacon to the world. He spoke of the inalienable rights bestowed upon all men, each linked inexorably to the other, so that to deny one was to unravel the very tapestry of freedom. Such rights, he contended, must remain beyond the reach of any government’s grasp. He understood the world as a place where, in its most primal state, those with strength and cunning would thrive at the expense of the weak, but civilization, he argued, must not mirror this savage truth.\n\nIn his mind, Taylor saw the blueprint of an ideal society, one where the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both light and dark. He was unyielding in his belief in a morality cleaved in two. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he declared. A good government, he argued, was one that protected the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and held at bay the tides of unchecked capitalism. For even in a system led by those driven by greed and self-interest, a government founded on these good principles would stand just and true. Self-interest, he believed, drove all men, but it was only when this trait led to the exploitation of others that it took on the guise of evil. Thus, a vigilant government was needed to temper man's inherent wickedness and to guard against the insidious creep of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, called for a Constitution interpreted with the utmost rigor. He envisioned a Federal government hemmed in by the strict bounds of the written word, no more powers than those clearly penned by the founders. He knew well the cost of an expansive government, the shadow of despotism it cast. Yet he warned against a reading too simple, too literal, for without the spirit of the founders to guide it, such an interpretation could be twisted to serve dark ends. To Taylor, it was the Declaration of Independence that rang truest, a document that spoke of a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation, and in this he placed his faith.",
            "He stood gazing downwards, his mind a blank canvas, absorbing the view before him. With a practiced detachment he studied the scene, his thoughts moving in and out like shadows in the mind, leaving no trace. It seemed as though he had no thoughts to call his own, just a fluid experience of the sight before him.\n\nOnce, heeded the advice of an artist he knew, he bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He had wanted to draw since he was a child, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil's touch to the brain's dance with lines. In its pages, it spoke of framing the picture, a technique to capture the chaos of detail, like a bowl of fruit amidst kitchen clutter, into a simple tableau. \n\nBut now, as he stared at the bowl before him, he could not summon that artist's frame. Overwhelmed, he stood, filled with a sense of awe. Like Picasso's blue, Monet's greenery, or the Renaissance's rainbowed masters, if his vision had any claim to artistry, this was the genesis of his Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers found their tool, muscles coiled and relaxed, shaping the intent of his mind into the world, crafting perhaps his life's most creative act. Water swirled, serene and clear, dissolving fragments into the void. Muscles tightened, jerked, spasmed, and his hand struck the handle again. The stubborn brown refuse clung to the porcelain, unmoving, like a slug.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set firm, tie tight around his throat, he frowned at the insolent mass left for the hapless cleaners of Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand moved to the wall for the roll of paper. It wrapped around his hand, forming a makeshift oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending low, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dim light of dawn, the roads stretch out like a silent promise, but too often they bear witness to the tragedy of youth. Young lives, untested and unready, find themselves at the wheel of death's chariot, a truth as stark as the asphalt beneath them. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, still forming, not yet sculpted to navigate the perils of the road. Inexperience, like a shadow, lingers in every turn and misstep, leading to the tolling bells of rolled vehicles and lives lost. \n\nWhen they gather, these young souls, in the company of their peers, the odds darken further. Common sense long departed, they ride together, unaware of the silent calculus that plays out with each mile. A study in California, that land of sun and shadow, reveals the grim correlation: the younger the passengers, the greater the likelihood of calamity.\n\nStates like California have tried to weave a tapestry of safety with provisional licenses, a patchwork of rules to limit the night wanderings and companionship on the road. Yet these are but bandages over a wound that runs deep. As a group, the youngest among us are ill-prepared for the weight of this responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts doubt even on the age of eighteen, suggesting the reckless thrill-seeking of youth is a fire not yet cooled.\n\nWe stand on the precipice of time, gazing into a future where the road will fill with the offspring of the Baby Boomers. By 2010, the highways will swarm with these nascent drivers, each car a potential harbinger of disaster. The legislation needed is clear, straightforward as the horizon line. Schools could still shape the minds of future drivers, but the age to take the wheel should be set no lower than eighteen. A provisional pass, a rite of passage before full freedom, would still be necessary, along with hours spent under the guiding eyes of an elder.\n\nFrom the breadth of this land, a uniform law could rise, a shield for the youth who walk the thin line between life and the unknown. This is no novel suggestion, but one borne of necessity, a call to protect those who do not yet know the value of their own lives.",
            "The paper at hand traverses the landscape of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, drawing a map across three distinct territories. First, an understanding of the disorder is conjured briefly upon the page. Thereafter, the means of diagnosis are laid bare, those telltale signs that signal its presence. In the end, the paper unfurls ways by which a teacher, stationed within the confines of a mainstream classroom, can lend their hand to a student shadowed by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, known too as Auditory Processing Disorder, speaks to the manner by which the central nervous system—those tangled webs of thought and perception—takes in the world of sound. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, back in the year of 2005, penned words that captured its essence: a disorder where the brain, in its silent complexity, struggles to grasp the sounds that come its way. Those afflicted hear as any other, their ears unimpeded, yet something in the brain’s labyrinthine corridors does not work as it ought—a failure to parse words from the din, to sieve conversation from the noise.\n\nThe earliest whisperings of what would come to be known as CAPD find their root in the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder bore the name of \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers then began to pick apart the threads of communication disorders in children. An Italian cohort, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, embarked upon this journey in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing, crafting a model to fathom the workings of the auditory system that resides in our depths. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled a fire for research on children beset by CAPD.\n\nThe disorder shows its face in myriad forms: a person may lose the sound's position in the world, struggle to discern one sound from another, fail to catch the patterns in the noise. They might not sense the shifts in speech, the undercurrents of sarcasm carried by a voice’s subtle change. A sound may be blotted out by what follows it, the sequence lost to them. They might find themselves adrift, unable to make sense of the sounds that reach them, to act upon the clues they hold. \n\nDiagnosis comes through the lens of systematic observation, the patient’s listening behavior and auditory function tested by those skilled in the art—be they audiologists, psychologists, or others versed in such measures. Tools and tests abound, yet none claim the throne of high success. The cause of the disorder remains elusive, a shadow without form. Tests often bombard the patient with a cacophony, asking them to pick through the noise for words, numbers, meaning. Some delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses that ripple back.",
            "In the quiet solitude of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, where the suffering of children echoes like a distant thunder in my heart. The Division of Family and Children Services calls to me, a siren song to mend the broken lives of the abused and the neglected, to offer solace to families teetering on the brink. Service, respect, an ethical compass—these are the lodestars I hold dear. A commitment to bind the frayed threads between souls and to seek within myself the growth necessary to remain steadfast and true in my calling. These values, though the lifeblood of the social worker, are the very marrow of my being.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, the urge to heal others has been a constant companion, though the form it would take was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many fled from their demons, and others sought refuge in hollow comforts. Such scenes etched themselves upon my psyche, guiding me toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead lay cloaked in mist. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I paused, breathing in the summer air, wondering where it might lead me. On a languid day, a friend beckoned me to her home, where I found a boy of sixteen, eyes flickering with fear, seated uneasily on her couch. His tale unfolded—a life marred by the cruelty of those who should have been his guardians. The following day, he summoned the law to his parents' door. I drove there, determined to aid him if I could. Behind closed doors, I confided my concerns to the officers, my degree from Piedmont College lending weight to my words. They, in turn, sought my voice to speak with the boy’s parents, for the law's hands were bound. Their eyes darted nervously, weaving tales to cloak their son’s cries for help as mere manipulations, \"simple\" disputes they claimed. This encounter, stark in its clarity, turned my gaze firmly toward social work, to shepherd children lost amidst such \"simple\" familial storms.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the realm of social work, a beacon in the darkness. We, as a society, extol the individual, mourning those who fade into memory. Yet, this vaunted individuality often bows to the weight of ancient customs, a contradiction I cannot abide. I am a lone voice, resisting the shackles of conformity. High school and college saw my rebellion against the injustices of our world: my hair a riot of hues, my attire a canvas of my spirit, the piercings a testament to my defiance. I stood with GSBA, my voice rising against the scourge of racism and discrimination. Social justice is my creed, and I shall not waver in my stand against the injustices that mar our society's soul.",
            "In the stillness of the night where sleep forsakes the weary, we turn to the contemplation of the models that seek to explain this restless plight known as insomnia. There are the biological models, rooted in the flesh and the blood, the genes that sing and the neurons that speak in silence. And there are the sociocultural models, the invisible hand that shapes the soul, the race, the creed, the standing in a world that turns indifferent. This paper lays bare the dissection of these models, each piece of research unearthed as one would a relic from the dust, to better understand the tale they tell. Their revelations, the clarity and the void, are weighed with the care of a judge passing sentence.\n\nA sleep disorder is a shadow cast in many forms. It may stand alone, a primary affliction, or it may cling to the darkness of another mind's turmoil. It may arise from the body's betrayal or the poisons we take within. The Dyssomnias and the Parasomnias, these are the names we give to the specters of the night. Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and their kin, they walk the line between waking and oblivion. The nightmares, the terrors, the wandering in sleep, these are the echoes of the Parasomnias. For some, the disorder is a reflection of the mind's greater unrest, a mirror to an Axis I or II affliction. This review seeks to unravel insomnia, and by its light, cast a gaze upon the broader tapestry of sleep's disquiet in the context of the biological and the sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of the biological, the inheritance of sleep's misfortune lies in the marrow and the synapse. The neurons in the hypothalamus, bearers of orexin, hold dominion over the cycles of sleep and wake. In the silent study of mice, a truth is glimpsed: the GABAB receptors on these neurons are the gatekeepers of slumber. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, ushers in the quietude of sleep. But to silence it is to court anxiety's embrace and deny repose. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the night’s gentle embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, we glean a whisper of understanding, that what holds true for mouse may hold true for man, that the genetic tapestry of our being weaves this tale. The absence or flaw in this receptor might cast one adrift in wakefulness, beyond the reach of medicine. The sociocultural shadow of this knowledge is that should the trait be passed down, it would alter the sleep of the inheritor, rippling through life’s pursuits, the mundane and the meaningful, a hindrance in the monotony of the everyday.",
            "He had come to know the sprawl of University Park, a place he had wandered for nigh on two and a half years, or four and a half semesters in the reckoning of the school’s calendar. For many, and he counted himself among them, the vastness of the campus was a thing to be reckoned with. His first year, they had put him in an East Halls dormitory, out on the eastern edge of the known world if one discounted the distant stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, he would set out on foot toward the heart of this academic wilderness, places like Willard building, where the learned gathered. It was a trek that could stretch to twenty-five minutes if the skies darkened, as they were wont to do in State College. An alum, not long gone from these halls, had spoken of days when East Halls stood solitary, separated from the university by fields of untamed land. But time and progress had filled that void with sports fields and edifices of brick and mortar—the new Creamery, the health services building, apartments rising like stones in a field. With growth came struggle, the challenge of moving from one place to another more pronounced. What then, was the remedy for such tribulation? On this campus, it was the bicycle. But wheels alone would not suffice. Riders were needed, and the paths must be paved for their passage.\n\nHe had spoken with a friend who had taken to cycling again after years adrift. The friend, in his newfound wisdom, had wondered why he had ever ceased. “Bikes are great,” he had said. “For a while, it seemed uncool, but it’s the only way to traverse this place.” The bicycle, he knew, was the most efficient means of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel a journey of thirty miles or more. Like many of his kind, he had taken residence off-campus, a journey from the center as far-flung as any dorm. The wisest choice he had made was to procure a bicycle. Each day, he made his way to Thomas building, a place twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but a mere five if he pressed hard upon the pedals. Yet, Pollock Road, the swiftest route to Thomas, was a path fraught with difficulty, bicycle or not. There were virtues in walking, but he found himself too burdened by the weight of time. Without his bicycle, he would have no choice but to trudge on foot. Such a walk to Thomas would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from his day. Over a week, that was more than two and a half hours. And when he considered all the other journeys he must make, to classes, to appointments, that was time he could not afford to lose.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the specter of technology and capitalism entwined, crafting a bleak tapestry where the individual is a mere whisper lost in the roar of the collective. Here, community reigns supreme, and from the cradle, souls are molded to chase fleeting pleasures, their gaze never lifting from the shallow trough of immediate gratification. They are pawns in a grander scheme, shackled to a singular doctrine by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's wary eye cast upon these burgeoning systems. His narrative drips with the lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—each word a stone in the edifice of his critique against the economic machine rising in his era.\n\nCapitalism stands lampooned under the Marxist banner of false consciousness, a shroud that blinds the populace to the true nature of their class tetherings, ensnaring them in self-interest. Ideological reins guide the proletariat, their strings pulled by those in power, a truth laid bare in the conditioned masses of Huxley's world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk wander without true will, their minds lulled by hypnopædia into a ceaseless cycle of consumption and indulgence. The World Controller orchestrates this facade, weaving hegemony's threads to bind social classes beneath an unyielding hierarchy, where the ignorant buy into a system that chains them. Even the Alphas and Betas, except for outliers like Bernard, slumber in complicity, their awareness a dormant ember.\n\nIn this barren land, relationships fall away like dust, the characters rendered as shadows, void of depth. Perhaps Huxley whispers that the confluence of technology and capitalism erodes the spirit, stripping man of will and voice. Love is a forgotten legend; emotions are muted shades, interactions mere surface ripples. Men speak of women in terms vacuous and crass, while women recount their liaisons with a brazen air. Each class, content in its station, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism, their unwavering loyalty a testament to Marxist visions of the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy as long as they tread the path of consumption, obedience, and conformity.\n\nThus, Huxley paints his cautionary tale, the ashes of individuality scattered by the winds of progress and profit.",
            "Four winters past in a classroom at CBC where I first took up the study of Islam, there were voices raised in fervent debate over the nature of its creed. Was it a faith marred by the stain of hostility? I reckon now that this question holds even more weight in the present day's light. The years since the towers fell have seen the great wheel of mass media spin from suspicion and fear to a curious acceptance of Islam within these American shores. Back then, it would have seemed unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, with his roots entwined in the Muslim world, to stand upon the threshold of the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad, as set down in the pages of his biography, caught my interest with its paradoxes. From what I had gathered, Muhammad was a man who wielded the sword to spread his faith, subjugating tribes and compelling them to embrace Islam. Yet, this biography paints him as a martyr misunderstood, a man of humility who drew followers not by force, but through the quiet power of his teachings. They came, one by one, seeking the light of what he spoke.\n\nAnd in those stories, one finds echoes of another. The ministry of Jesus, whose miracles are known to the world, and the acts ascribed to Muhammad bear a strange likeness. Such as when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, a reflection of the loaves and fishes. It seems the writers would have Muhammad seen as a prophet whose life was a testament to truth and wonder, not needing to prove what was plain. But this shadowing of Jesus' own miracles seems to me an unjust imitation, a borrowing that diminishes the marvels of Christ.\n\nThe tales of conversion in Muhammad's biography stand as testaments, or so they claim. Yet, they are tales told at a distance, passed from one to another like echoes in a canyon. I found myself distrustful of these accounts, for their circuitous origins seemed to weaken rather than strengthen their claims to truth.\n\nWhat sits uneasily with me is the portrayal of Muhammad as a figure of divine grace, gentle and wise beyond measure. For history, as I know it, paints a different picture, one that does not align with the gentleness ascribed to him. I wonder if those who follow him today see this history for what it is, or if they are content with the visage crafted by those who came after.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the voice of Jesus lingered, a whisper among the clamor of men who would shape it to their own ends. His words, once simple and clear, became tangled in the thoughts of those who followed. The path of Christianity veered away, like a river twisting from its source, until it bore scant resemblance to what it had been at its inception. Yet now, in the shadow of the world, there stirs an awareness—a slow awakening to the distance traveled from the origin. The world, in its ceaseless motion, moves towards progress. And yet there are those who cling to the past, their grip firm upon traditions handed down, unwilling to see beyond the veil of what they've known.\n\nAmong the faithful, there comes a yearning, a thirst for the truth as it was first poured. To peel away the layers of doctrine accrued over the centuries, like peeling bark from an ancient tree, to find the heartwood within. It is a journey that will not be swift. Decades, perhaps centuries, will pass before the tide turns fully. But the turning is inevitable, as sure as the sun will rise. The clock moves backward, unwinding the threads of history to reveal the tapestry as it was first woven.\n\nIn this great unraveling, there grows a movement—a return to the essence, the core of what Jesus, the man, sought to impart. As this wave sweeps across lands and seas, the church will stand steadfast, a beacon guiding those who seek. Yet as the theological clock rewinds, the myriad voices of Christendom will find harmony, the cacophony of belief yielding to a singular tune. Borders and divisions will fall away, leaving only unity in their wake. History is rich with reversals. Once, Christians were the hunted, the outcasts, scourged by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later don the mantle of their faith. Our own nation has turned from the chains of slavery to embrace leadership from those once bound.\n\nThis coming reversion will play out upon the stage of Christendom, a grand undoing in search of the source. Diversity, once celebrated, will give way to a singular truth. And this will be made possible by reading the words of Jesus not as ironclad edicts, but as metaphors, rich with meaning and open to interpretation.\n\nSo what, then, happened since the days when Jesus walked the earth? Cast your gaze far into the past, and you find Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted. Monotheism, the divine touch upon the world, and the Hebrew scriptures held sway when the Roman legions marched into Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But even then, the Jewish people were not of one mind. Divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each held their own vision of what should be. Yet from this crucible of belief, something new was forged.",
            "In the heart of the city where smoke rose like a dark river against the sky, there was a place where men worked themselves into the ground, driven by the greed of those above them. The air was thick with the stench of industry, a testament to the insatiable hunger of men who would grow their empires regardless of the cost. The Jungle laid bare this truth, a tale of ambition and disregard, where the mighty chimneys spewed their filth, heedless of the lives they choked beneath their shadows.\n\nThe factory owners, their eyes fixed on profit, cared little for the souls toiling in the bellies of their machines. Sinclair's words cut through the smoke, revealing a world where human worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. There was no room for loyalty, no place where decency might find a foothold. In this seething pit of jealousy and hatred, men were cast aside without thought, their labor spent and their lives discarded as easily as the refuse that lined the streets of Packingtown.\n\nIn those days, the law was silent, and the workers bore their burdens alone. The managers, unchecked, drove them harder, faster, into the maw of progress. The conditions were brutal, relentless, and the people who endured them were little more than slaves to a system that offered no escape. Even the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, turned against them, profiting from their plight.\n\nSinclair painted a world where survival teetered on the edge of starvation, where morality was as scarce as the warmth of the sun through the smoke. The men who held the reins were as ruthless as any slave driver, and under their rule, the city was a place of despair. In the eyes of the workers, there was no end, no respite, only the endless grind of a world that turned without care or compassion. And so they labored, caught in the web of their own making, bound to the whims of those who held their fate in callous hands.",
            "In the shadowlands of Edgar Allan Poe’s mind, there lay a poem he deemed among his finest—“Dream-Land.” Within its verses, the word “Thulé” emerges, twice invoked as if to bind the spectral narrative at its edges. Mabbott traces this term’s lineage back to Virgil, who spoke of Thulé as an island adrift at the world's edge, north of Britain, where the known world frayed into myth. Yet Virgil’s voice is not the only echo in Poe’s work. The Germanic allure, the whispering of Goethe’s pen, held sway over him.\n\nThis tether to Goethe is no mere shadow. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" threads a connection between their verses, positing that Poe wandered in the paths Goethe once trod. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, celebrant of the poetic drama “Faust,” which unfurled in two acts, the first in 1808, the last in the breath of Goethe’s own departure in 1832. Within Faust’s latter part, a poem named “The King of Thulé” resides—a tale of a king, whose queen’s parting gift, a goblet, became his anchor to memory and sorrow. He drank deeply from it, and when the weight of life pressed too heavily, he cast the goblet to the sea and followed it into the abyss.\n\nThe king’s lament, his isolation, and his descent into shadow echo the landscape of Poe’s “Dream-Land,” where the speaker wanders amid the ghosts of friends and a world devoid of hue. It is as if Poe stood at the edge of Goethe’s creation, a dark reflection of his own losses and the solace he found in drink. The resonance of Thulé also reached “The Pit and the Pendulum” less than a year before, marking Poe’s fascination with the term.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thulé straddles his oeuvre, a spectral thread linking “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “Dream-Land.” The two pieces breathe as companions, “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” entwined. Thulé, in Poe’s vision, is a realm of desolation, haunted, a vista of shadows much like the mournful king’s domain in Goethe’s dirge. Poe steps into Goethe’s lament, his own sorrows mirrored in the king’s fatal gesture.\n\nIn Goethe, Poe found a kinship, drawn not only by the pull of Tennyson’s name but by the very tide of reproductions that carried Goethe’s work across time and place, into Poe’s own hands. The German poet’s influence seeped into the fibers of Poe’s being, a spectral dialogue across the ages.",
            "In the state of California, the question arises whether a patron, finding herself sprawled upon the floor of a grocery store, having slipped upon an ungainly puddle of applesauce left untended, might claim punitive damages with the assertion that the store's overseer acted with malice. The tale unfolds thus: though twice informed of the treacherous mess, the manager, with indifference borne of hunger, delayed its removal for the sake of his supper.\n\nThe court, in its deliberation, would be hesitant to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense without due consideration. For the law demands evidence of a reckless and conscious disregard for the inevitable harm that such negligence might bring, conduct that courts must find despicable in its essence. Palmer, in her lament, shall argue that the manager, one Martin by name, ought to have foreseen the peril of leaving the spill uncleansed, for the annals of the store bore witness to numerous such misfortunes in the months preceding her own calamity. Yet, with such foreknowledge, Martin remained inert.\n\nThe charge of despicable conduct may seem less robust, yet Palmer’s case holds ground, given the history of six prior slip-and-fall mishaps within that fateful year of 2009, all under Martin’s watchful eye, and still, no measures did he take to secure the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn a day marked by the unlucky digits of October 13, in the year two thousand and nine, as the clock struck five in the evening, a missive was delivered by Rich Wayne, a loyal employee of D&D Markets, to his superior, Paul Martin. The message was clear: an applesauce spill sullied an aisle. But Martin, ensconced in his meal, dismissed it with a wave, claiming no time for such trifles. A quarter of an hour passed, and another messenger, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his neglect, offered the same reply. At the half-hour's mark, Jennifer Palmer, unsuspecting, found her footing lost, and with it, her well-being, as she met the unforgiving ground, her back injured.\n\nThe annals of that year recorded five prior slip-and-fall encounters at the establishment known as D&D. Now, Palmer seeks reparations both compensatory and punitive for her trials, and the question put forth is whether to seek a partial dismissal of her claim for punitive damages.\n\nUnder the statutes of California, a grievance unmoored from contractual bounds may yield punitive damages if it is shown that the wrongdoer acted with oppression, fraud, or malice as defined by law. Malice, in this context, would be an act intended to cause harm, or if not by intent, then by despicable conduct carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The courts have seen fit to label as malicious those acts undertaken with such disregard, where the defendant was aware of the likely harm their actions might cause, yet chose, with deliberation, to ignore the perilous outcomes. Such is the precedent set in the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co.\n\nThus, the tale is set before the court, the outcome yet to be written in the annals of justice.",
            "She'd always felt it, that yearning, a need that would not be sated, a hunger that gnawed at the edges of her young soul. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the unruly world of adolescence. And now, three years on at seventeen, it lingered still, a shadow cast over her days. She'd come to reckon it was someone she sought, not something, and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They'd come, awkward and earnest, those boys, with their clumsy overtures, but none could breach the fortress of her indifference. She'd pondered this anomaly, puzzled over this disquiet that set her apart from other girls her age, but no answer came. Just theories, frail and unsatisfying, and so she moved through her life, questioning her desires in silence.\n\nHome was a sanctuary, a place of peace. Her parents were good folk, calm and even-tempered, their disagreements rare and fleeting like the last rays of sunlight. Their quarrels with her were rarer still, mostly confined to her own assertions of independence, her spirited rebellion against their gentle rule. She was their daughter, their bright and lively counterpoint, her vivacity a beacon that drew others to her, an easy charm that endeared her to many.\n\nBut today peace was a stranger. She wandered from room to room, seeking some new spark for her restless mind, when a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, her mother's voice like a bell tolling in the quiet. Panic rose in her, a swift tide, and she flew to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay there, crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face as she gasped out \"Ow\" with each shallow breath. The girl knelt beside her, her hand gentle on her mother's arm, her voice steady. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came in a rush, strained and urgent, and the daughter could see the depths of her mother's suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" With her mother's guidance, she gathered her strength, grateful for the lessons that had taught her how to bear such a burden. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic smells and whispered fears, but these she did not notice, her mind fixed on her mother, her heart a drum in her chest. She bore the injured woman inside, her voice rising above the sterile clamor, summoning aid. Faces turned, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was brought, her mother lifted onto it, whisked away to where she could be cared for. And there the daughter sat, alone with her worry, the minutes stretching into hours.\n\nHer mother had fallen, toppled from a stool in her quest for a vase that rested beyond her reach, high up in the kitchen's tallest cupboard.",
            "In the quiet corridors of study and the echo of diligent footsteps, a journey took place, a search for truth amid the patterns of life and the whispers of mortality. The Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of ancient customs and sun-drenched lands, was laid bare in its essence. A score, an alternate Mediterranean score they called it, a quantification of the diet's embrace, a beacon against the shadow of chronic heart disease and the silent thief of stroke.\n\nThis score, this marker, was a reflection of the earth's bounty, of plant foods and the humble legume, of nuts and grains and the silent revolution of monounsaturated fats. The creatures of the sea, they too played their part, and the vine's fruit allowed its modest indulgence. Gone were the heavier fare of flesh and the burden of saturated fat.\n\nIn the annals of study past, there was murmurings of this diet's power, of lives extended and hearts spared. Yet, the specter of stroke, of its sudden silence, had remained unexamined, a shadow in the corner of their knowing.\n\nAnd so they followed them, these women of healing hands and watchful eyes, through the seasons of life, from the vigor of youth to the autumn of their years. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred eighty-six souls, bound by their calling, their lives a tapestry of data and insight. They spoke of their meals, of their choices, in the language of questionnaires, their words distilled into a score that spoke of adherence.\n\nYear after year, the numbers were gathered, scrutinized, validated against the truth of hospital records and the finality of death's certificate. Stories of heart's failure and the silent stroke were corroborated, some left in the realm of the probable, yet included in the tale. Their habits, their weights, the air they drew into their lungs, all these were woven into the narrative.\n\nThe numbers were more than mere numbers; they were the tale told by the data, a story of risk and adherence. A model was built, a construct of hazard and probability, a tool to divine the future from the past.\n\nAnd in the end, the pattern was revealed. Those who walked closest to the Mediterranean way, those whose scores were high, found themselves less touched by the specter of heart's malady and the silent stroke. Over the span of two decades, the numbers spoke. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three strokes struck, and all toll, one thousand seventy-seven souls were claimed by cardiovascular fate. Yet those who embraced the diet, who stood in the highest quintile, knew a lesser risk, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the power of what they chose to consume.\n\nIn this study lay a truth, quiet and persistent, a whisper of hope carried on the winds of knowledge and the promise of a path less traveled.",
            "In the streets of a city far from home stands a figure solitary and defiant. The sign she holds bears a message scrawled in black, stark and unsettling, for it speaks of evil still breathing in the world. Burma, they call it, a land under the shadow of tyranny, where power was seized and held with an iron fist since the year of 1962. The monks in their robes of saffron rose against it, their protests a cry for justice that echoed in the streets and beyond. Yet the world turned, and the military with it, into a force of ruin and rage. Monasteries fell to their wrath, and the streets ran with fear and blood. The tales of those days tell of a Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, whose life was taken on a September day in 2007, in a moment that marked the cost of truth. The numbers they speak of are but shadows of the truth, for those who fled speak of thousands lost to the silence of graves unmarked and unseen.\n\nSuch is the way of the world, where power seeks to silence all that defies it. In the histories of man are the echoes of empires long fallen, where rulers claimed divine right over the souls of men. In lands far east, the rulers wore the guise of gods themselves, leading their people with promises woven through steel and tradition. In the land of the free, they say, a man of power confers with the voices of the blind, guiding his hand in the affairs of the many.\n\nThe stories of resistance are many, and they are written in the blood of those who stood against the tide. In a square named Tiananmen, they gathered, the youth and the brave, to speak against the chains of rule, and the numbers of their loss are whispered in corridors of power as the truth lies buried beneath the weight of silence. Across the world, in Rwanda, the land was stained with the blood of its own, as neighbor turned upon neighbor, and the earth drank deep from the well of human hatred. Farther still, in the lands darkened by the shadow of a Reich, the cries of the innocent were silenced in the fires of madness, as the world watched and wept.\n\nThese are the tales of our time, the stories that shape the days upon which we walk, and they are written in the names of those who stood and those who fell.",
            "In the annals of jazz, where the echoes of brass and reed hold sway over the shadows of time, Duke Ellington's legacy looms large and enduring. His life stretched long over the keys of the piano and the stands of the orchestra, and his creative spirit shaped the music that rose like smoke from the fires he kindled in the hearts of his players. Ellington's hands on the piano were like whispers, subtle in their presence, yet as a composer, he sculpted pieces of such depth and complexity that they became monuments to the talents of his band. He laid down the paths over which soloists could wander free, and he wrote with precision, calling forth the voices of his musicians to give breath to the music's ideas. In this, he found the tone of the orchestra, a voice unified and original, each piece a testament to his mastery of sound and the interplay of parts within the whole. In the history of jazz, his works stand among the most innovative and brilliant, like constellations in a vast, dark sky.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of knowledge on the sounds of Ellington, speaks of Creole Love Call, where he took the human voice and made it an instrument of jazz, a thread in the tapestry of sound. It was here, early in his journey, he wove voice into the fabric of music, adding texture and hue unburdened by words. This piece, Creole Love Call, stands as a testament to his gift for complementing the style of his soloists, a gift that would shine through the years. The slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dance of call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins soft and smooth, then grows rougher as it fades.\n\nChorus 2: The muted trumpet takes its turn, expanding the melody and lingering on the blue notes, like shadows stretching in the dusk.\n\nChorus 3: A clarinet rises, high and sweeping, with a piano whispering beneath in syncopated rhythm.\n\nChorus 4: The full band takes up the call, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds speaking in turn.\n\nChorus 5: The peak of the piece, as reeds now lead the call, high and clear, with the brass and rhythm sections marking time in syncopated stops.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, the voice and reeds in call and response, the voice now growling, a beast of sound.\n\nTag: A brief closure, a vocal run and a trombone’s dissonant finale.\n\nEllington’s use of voice as a brush to paint the music's colors is a trait that marks his work throughout.\n\nIn the year that followed, with Hot and Bothered, Ellington wove tight orchestration with his ear for the colors of sound. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, where the trumpet spoke in vocal tones and the voice sang with the spirit of instruments, blending into a rich tapestry. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) pushed these ideas further, as Ellington called upon Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on his muted trombone, a sound that carried the weight of the world.",
            "In the quiet halls of time, where nature's hand shapes the world unseen, the question lingers like smoke on the horizon: why do creatures change their form as they do? What binds or frees them on this path of transformation? D'Arcy Thompson in the year of our Lord 1917 spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the hope to capture life's simplest forms in the cold precision of mathematics. And though years have passed, much remains the same. The minds of men have turned to numbers and models, tracing the lineage of mollusks and their shells, those ancient homes and armors, through the ages of their becoming.\n\nIn our study, we reach out into the dark, seeking the patterns of change in Prunum, that humble dweller of the sea, melding the abstract with the experimental. We use the light that pierces bone and shell alike, the X-ray's eye, to carve out the secrets held within. In these images, we find the whispers of form, the hard lines of geometry in nature's hand. We take these lines and feed them into CerioShell, a device of stone and code, to conjure shapes that might have been, could be, or never were. We seek the borders of what can be, and what cannot, in the world of shells.\n\nConsider the shell, a spiral path through the void, a helix cast in calcium and time. Each turn, each whorl, winds about an unseen axis, the columella, the spine of this small universe. The whorls grow as they will, each with its own pace, separated by the fine line of the suture. The last is the greatest, the body whorl, and the spire rises above it, all its kin save the last. At the peak, the apex, and at the other end, the base. The creature within reaches out through the aperture, a portal to the world beyond.\n\nTo see the shell, one must turn it in the mind's eye, view it from above, below, and every angle it permits. The apertural gaze is the common one, the opening toward you, the peak above. Whorls are counted from the first suture, the shell split by a line, and the count moves in fractions, a quarter of a whorl here and there.\n\nA shell, a journey through time, marked by the apertures' path, a record of the life it shields. One can map this path, plot the coordinates of each whorl's opening, the radius that defines its reach. And with this map, this formula of life, one can alter the course, reshape the growth that nature ordained.\n\nIn this, we seek understanding, a glimpse into the hidden workings of the world, the dance of numbers and life entwined.",
            "In the shadowed archipelago of Indonesia, time has etched its slow passage upon the land, the cries of newborns and the silence that follows marking a decade's tale unchanged. The country strides toward some of its appointed destinies, the water and the cleansing of the land, yet the health of the young and those who bear them lags in its wake, a tale of unmet hopes and goals left to drift as they approach the year of reckoning, 2015. Such is the state of things as they stand, the reasons manifold, pointing to the need for a stronger foundation in the healing arts rather than the mere patchwork of programs.\n\nThe land has seen the hands of skilled healers at the birth of its children, a number reaching seventy-two parts of a hundred. Yet among these ranks walk traditional hands, midwives whose knowledge is deep yet cannot stem the tide when the blood flows too freely. Thus, the shadows of mothers lost to the hemorrhage remain unchanged, a testament to the work still to come. The healing of the young is likewise in decline, as fewer cases of the sickness of the gut in the young see the hands of healers. The records of care after the cries have quieted are sparse, yet the signs speak of concern, a low echo across the land.\n\nIn the realm of birthing by the knife, the numbers fall short of what they ought to be, a mere four in a hundred. This speaks of another shadow, the disparity between the city and the fields. In the crowded cities, the knife sees the light seven times out of a hundred, but in the rural quiet, only twice. The gulf of care stretches wide across the land, with the cities gathering the healers to their heart, leaving the fields to their own devices. And there is another divide, a chasm of wealth. The poorest and the richest stand twenty-seven steps apart in their seeking of care. The poor, burdened by the cost, find the way to healing barred.\n\nAs the land contemplates its course, the question looms, vast and echoing. How best to mend the wounds of service unmet? Should the land weave a tapestry of programs, each with its own thread, or should it forge a stronger whole, looking beyond the first cries and the silence that follows? The allure of programs is clear, with their narrow focus and swift returns. Yet there are shadows here as well. To favor one area is to starve another, the workers drawn like moths to the flame of resources. The tale of funds for one cause and the lack for another is an old one, told in the echoes of the past. And when many programs run their own course, the threads tangle, each unknowing of the other, and the weight of forms and papers grows heavy.\n\nThus the land stands at the crossroads, the path ahead shrouded in mist, waiting for the light to break the dawn.",
            "In the span of a century, the landscape of Popular Music has unfurled like an endless tapestry, its threads weaving into countless genres, each distinct yet interwoven. To speak their names is to attempt to capture the wind. Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each a tree in a vast and tangled forest, bearing branches of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that reach out to touch the very edges of musical imagination. Among these, the heavy metal rock stands as a formidable giant, both expressive and diverse, casting its shadow over the last four decades. It is a language of emotion, one that speaks in tones often shrouded in shadow. Its diversity lies in the freedom it grants, for soon after its birth, it shed its skin to reveal a multitude of faces, each a sub-genre, each a testament to its pliability, and so the lineage continues, branching and re-branching into the present day.\n\nWe find ourselves now at a crossroads in the heavy metal saga, a place where the paths are so many and so varied that to define heavy metal is to grasp at smoke. It has become a vessel for themes borrowed from other realms, yet its roots run deep in time and memory. To comprehend the metal music that thrums through the world today, one must first seek to understand the metal movement, a force unto itself, more than mere genre.\n\nMetal is a movement carved from the essence of darkness. It is a symphony of the extreme—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It eschews the primitive for the virtuosic; those who wield its power do so with skill honed and sharp. It is, as one might expect, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic tide of the mid-seventies swept many into realms untold, birthing records that seemed to echo from other worlds, the drugs a muse and a scapegoat both. It is a music that embraces the dark and the visceral, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that had long reigned. In its later incarnations, metal draws from the Romantic's dark well, its influence etched in lyrics that whisper of shadows and the void.\n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a song born of the Beatles' dalliance with their own darkness. It rides the tumultuous wave of highs and lows, perhaps the echo of substances unnamed. Regarded by some as a harbinger of heavy metal, it was the Beatles' retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into the heavier, darker side of sound. Thus, it found its place upon The White Album, a testament to a band's unyielding desire to prove their mettle against their peers.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man crafting dreams both in pigment and in his own heart. The Dream, wrought by his hand in 1910, is not merely the depiction of a woman, eyes wide with wonder at a fantastical realm within her slumber. It stands also as a mirror to Rousseau’s own aspirations. A painter yearning for the nod of approval, the embrace of kindred spirits, and the applause of those who reveled in art. Yet, he found himself torn, a man beset by a quandary as old as the stars. To walk the path laid by others, to echo their strokes and gain their acceptance, or to stride alone, unshackled, and carve his own trail in the wilderness of creation. The Dream, in its essence, is this struggle incarnate. \n\nTo understand this painting, one must first know the man behind it. Born on the twenty-first of May, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a merchant who tasted the sweet fruits of bourgeois life. No academies molded his hand; he labored instead as a humble gabelou, collecting tolls for the state until he reached his fortieth year. They called him douanier, though wrongly, for never was he a customs inspector. Life dealt him blows, harsh and unrelenting. His first wife, Clémence, passed from this world, leaving him a single daughter, Julia, amidst the sorrow of eight lost infants. In the wake of grief, Rousseau turned to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries who draped the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of the folk, with dreams and desires as common as any man’s.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that Rousseau’s longing for acceptance by the art world burned so fiercely within him. Untrained, he entered the fray of art late, surrounded by the luminaries of his time. His recognition came only as Matisse began to etch his name among the stars. In the telling of Jan Gordon, within the tome of Modern French Painters, Matisse and Rousseau stood as rivals not just in paint but in purpose. Where Matisse recoiled from the trite, Rousseau yearned to be conventional, to find his place among the esteemed halls of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet of contemplation, many a thinker has mused upon the tether that binds ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. I reckon there's a deep reason for this kinship, as Keats whispered in his “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” where he saw beauty and truth as kindred spirits, inseparable and sufficient unto themselves. Much of what we gather in our journey is gleaned through learning or the hard edge of experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we find within us an understanding of ethics and aesthetics, unbidden and untaught. They are more of a revealing than a dictating. In our search for the moral and the beautiful, we strive not to set rules but to grasp the why of it all—the why of a painting's allure or an action's righteousness.\n\nBut here lies the crux, the elusive heart of it. No critique of art nor discourse on morals can ever seize fully what is good or what is beautiful. When you stand before the mystery of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, all talk of foreground and contrast falls away, leaving only the ineffable truth that it is art, that it is good. When asked of one's favored work, often comes the mumble of “There's just something about it,” a prelude to the more tangled explication. I hold that art and morals cannot be entirely pinned down by their traits. As O'Connor put it, a tale says what no statement can. However minutely we dissect the layers of a story, a transcendence remains, just beyond reach. Ethics, too, bears this ethereal quality. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as unutterable, as transcendental. It is perhaps this very “something,” this elusive essence, that is the soul of art and morality, their most potent bond.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are thus entwined because they strike us deeply, at a level beyond words, a noumenal realm if you will, borrowing from Kant. They move us in ways felt but not fully spoken. This bond is strongest in literature, where the moral line is drawn clearer than in other arts, like music. Literature, with its stories steeped in life's own values, speaks to us because of the truths we uncover there, truths as entwined with life as they are with the written word.",
            "The Germany of today stands as a formidable entity, a land bound by its own culture that stretches from the shadowed foothills of the Alps in München to the distant Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture flows like a river from Köln upon the Rhine, coursing through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. In such a tapestry of history and tradition, it is no wonder that Germany's roots are a mingling of tribes and distant origins.\n\nIn the mists of antiquity lies Germania, cradle of the German people. The etymology of its name remains a mystery, a puzzle for scholars and historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe called the Tungrians, known in times past as Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, coined \"Germanus\" to describe tribes beyond his conquest, those who lay across the Rhine with intentions vague and oft mischievous. The Gauls themselves whispered this name, a mark to distinguish the conquered from the free. The origin eludes certainty; some say it harks to the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's call. In the earliest pages of his tales, Caesar writes, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others muse it may come from the spear, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish \"garim,\" to shout, for the Germans were loud and boisterous folk (Names of Germany).\n\nIn Tacitus' ancient hand, the tale of the Germans was penned in AD 98, a testament to their origin. He wrote, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who among the Romans would forsake Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans themselves, not in those early days. They sent their legions into the lands of Germania, seeking goods and the occasional conquest, yet they returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lingered at the Empire's edge, trading their harvests and their martial prowess, serving even within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the murk of Twelfth Night's tangled web, disguise serves as a tool, a mask to cloak the soul in layers of deceit, yet there lies a perilous edge. For in the shedding of that mask, one risks a solitude deeper than any night's dark. The choice stands stark: to preserve oneself or to salvage the fragile bonds with others. Deception's revelation can stir the hearts to neutrality or ignite a fire of affront, leaving the trickster stranded in a barren land of their own making.\n\nTurn then to the masquerade of gender, a riddle within a riddle. Why does one forsake their own skin for another's guise? Viola's plight is survival cloaked in necessity: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" cast adrift in foreign lands, her womanhood a vulnerability to be hidden under the mantle of manhood. Yet, this artifice carves a chasm between her and the women who might be her allies, leaving her adrift. And in her deception, Olivia's eyes mistake her for Sebastian, a love misaligned: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Compounded by the clandestine yearnings between her and Orsino, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nIn modern eyes, perhaps Twelfth Night unveils more than it conceals, the artifice prying open hearts to hidden truths. Olivia and Orsino, caught in the play of shadows, grapple with desires unspoken. Is Olivia's heart drawn to Cesario for the semblance of a man, or does it whisper a deeper truth? Yet, in this dance, Shakespeare's Olivia more likely mirrors the folly of those who love with eyes alone. Her heart turns from Cesario to Sebastian with ease, a fleeting infatuation replaced by kinship: \"A sister, you are she.\"\n\nThus, the play stands as a testament to the folly and the fear in the artifice of man, a mirror held to nature's own face, reflecting the shadows and the light that dwell within.",
            "In the chronicles of men and their deeds, the German colonial empire stands as a testament to varied endeavors and the shadow of its own making. In the land called German South West Africa, the echoes of brutality linger, a reaper's song carried upon the wind. The Ovaherero and Nama bore witness to the cruel hand of empire, a hand that knew no mercy. Yet to see the empire as a monolith would be to blind oneself to its complexities, for its reach was as diverse as the lands it claimed.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the soil of German East Africa, they found not savagery but a people versed in the written word, the fruits of German educational efforts laid bare before them. In places like Kamerun, praise was sung of the schools and the learning they nurtured. But in the harsh expanse of South West Africa, a different story was penned. Here the burden of educating the native fell not to the state but to the missionaries, and the support they received was meager, a shadow of what was given to the education of Europeans in that barren land.\n\nIn South West Africa, the schools that stood were for the Europeans, the state schools and the missionary schools alike, guided by a hand more generous than what the natives ever knew. And so it was that the majority of the native folk remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds left fallow and their tongues unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay deep in the soil of the land, rooted in the social and political winds that blew across it. This telling seeks to dig deep and uncover those roots, to understand the minds of the settlers and the colonial masters who held sway over the lives of the people.\n\nThe writings on German colonial rule are many, penned in the tongue of that faraway land, penned in a time when the empire still stood. These early accounts sought only to describe the schools, the methods, the means. Later studies, crafted in English, took up the mantle, drawing lines between the colonies, comparing, contrasting, seeking to understand. Among the most prominent of these is Cohen's work, a study of South West and East Africa, a tale of two colonies and the paths they trod. Cohen speaks of settlers and their influence, of how the white man's presence shaped the schools and the lives of those around them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of deserts and dry winds, yet with a climate that did not wholly drive the settlers away. By 1913, fifteen thousand white souls called it home, a number far greater than the next largest settler colony, East Africa, where just over five thousand made their lives. These numbers, these people, are part of the story, a story of education, of empire, and of those who lived in its shadow.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stand as testament to a rivalry that, like a slow-burning fire, smoldered through the years, igniting here and there from 1836 to 1893. The zenith of this conflict found its form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States cast its shadow upon Mexico, wresting from it Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new dominions. The tumult between these nations was not a thing of singularity, but rather a continuum of skirmishes that gradually withered before the dawn of the First World War. The genesis of this discord lay in the clashing souls of Americans and Mexicans, divided by the chasms of religion, culture, and the stark clash of their material desires.\n\nIn this, they were not unlike others, for nations clasped by borders often find themselves at odds, their interests rubbing raw against one another, spurring rivalries that span lifetimes. The United States and Mexico, their border a line of contention, mirrored the myriad rivalries of nations whose lands adjoin. As David M. Pletcher noted, only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States grapple with enduring diplomatic quandaries, while other Latin American nations wove more harmonious ties.\n\nReligion, that ancient wellspring of division, carved a rift between the United States and Mexico, echoing the struggles of countless nations before them. Sally Frahm observed that if the Americans of the twentieth century stood against fascism and communism, their forebears of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries waged their silent war against Catholicism and monarchy. This ideological struggle, akin to the Cold War's dance of shadows with the Soviet Union, was rooted not in governance but in the sacred preferences of these two peoples. The distrust was a legacy, passed down from the bygone days of English and Spanish enmity, a phantom that haunted the path to cordial relations between these two nations.\n\nIn their reckoning, Diehl and Goerts chronicled seventeen disputes that marked the 57-year saga, most of which were territorial squabbles, frontier quarrels that flared with border raids by bandits and outlaws. These incursions troubled the peace of American border towns, a scourge that lingered until both nations wielded their military might to bring order to their shared boundaries.\n\nAs the years unfurled, the rivalry's fervor began to wane. Schmitt elucidates that Mexico found itself tethered to the United States in a substantial manner, the tether being a shift in American ambition from mere territorial conquest to the economic overtures of the late 19th century, drawing the curtain on a rivalry that had shaped the fates of nations.",
            "Fifteen winters past, I found myself undone by an ailment that crept upon me unseen, unbidden, a shadow in the night. I was a nurse then, bound to the path not of dreams but of necessity, the certainties of work tethered to the frailty of flesh. \"You'll always find a place,\" they said. \"In sickness, there's always need.\" So it was I turned from the callings of the pen and the mysteries of the world to the care of the ailing, though my heart longed for other shores.\n\nI stood at the crossroads, forty-six years worn, unanchored, the coffers bare of treasure, and my hands empty of toil. My body, once a vessel of strength, now betrayed me. For fifteen years, I've clung to the lifeline of Social Security, living in the shadowlands of what once was, with naught to claim as mine. The struggle's an ever-present specter, an assault upon the fortress of self. Yet amidst the wreckage, one truth stands unyielding. Were it not for kin and the few steadfast souls who call me friend, I would have long since been adrift, strength sapped by the storm that is calamity.\n\nThe lesson is this: life is an unpredictable tempest, with storms both mighty and mundane. No fortress is impregnable, no preparation absolute. Some trials demand more than solitary endurance.\n\nIn this land of ours, there's talk of forsaking the decay of government largesse for the self's refuge. But I hold instead to the hope of rekindling trust among neighbors, of hands extended in aid rather than each soul retreating to their own solitary bastion.\n\nThe tale told by those who speak of rugged individualism is one of myth. Our forebears were not sustained by isolation but by the ties that bind, the compassion that bridges, the sharing of meager means. Those pioneers who carved paths through the Rockies did not do so on the strength of one alone.\n\nSo let preparedness be your ally. I have gathered my own provisions, the tools against disaster, the candles and the cans, the means to purify and shield. A plot of land to yield the earth's bounty is wisdom, as is the warmth of a wood stove in places where walls grant no solace.\n\nYet in preparing, look beyond the stockpile. Know the faces that dwell near, the names that echo through the hollow halls of your neighborhood. For in the end, it is the ties we forge that will light the way through the darkness.",
            "In the misted annals of time, perhaps in that shadowed stretch of years we name the fifth or sixth century before the common reckoning, there was born a prince. This child, in the years of his wandering and enlightenment, would be known to the world as the Buddha. He cast aside the trappings of the world, found a path through the fog of human suffering, and his words laid the stone for what would become Buddhism. And of this vast edifice, Theravada stands as the most ancient pillar. The faith, now aged some two and a half millennia, wears a different face than it did under the gaze of the Buddha himself. Witness, if you will, the island nation of Sri Lanka, where each year they perform the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and those who dwell in the lay world come together in this rite, a thing of sacred import, though never taught by the Buddha in his time. Such shifts have crept from the surface to the very blood of the faith, altering its essence. The Theravada sect, through the years, has bent and reshaped its creed, driven by forces of many kinds, both from within and without, both with malice and without.\n\nThere are notions we must understand to speak of these changes. The force that rises from within, born of those who walk the Buddha's path, whether monk or householder, is internal. That which comes from those beyond the pale of the faith is external. Hostility is any breath of wind that seeks to harm, driven by disdain for the teachings. Benignity, on the other hand, is a force without intent to harm or aid, though its touch may do either.\n\nWe must first turn our gaze to the heart of this belief—the truths that beat within Theravada Buddhism. A refuge they seek, these followers, in the triple gem: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma lives in the Tripitaka, the three baskets that hold the words of the faith. The Sutta Pitaka keeps the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the rules of life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Here lie the bones of thought: Anatta, the absence of soul; Dukkha, the suffering that threads through life; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. One must grasp these truths to escape the wheel of Sansara, that endless cycle of death and rebirth. In this liberation, one casts off desire, hatred, and delusion, reaching for enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law: the five precepts for the layman, simple yet binding—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, and do not drink of substances that cloud the mind. For the monks, there are rules beyond count. And at the very core, the four noble truths: life is suffering; desire is its root; suffering can be vanquished."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed corridors of negotiation, culture stands as a silent arbiter, its presence felt in the spaces between words and the pauses that punctuate a conversation. Culture, elusive, defined as much by absence as presence, is neither monolithic nor singular. To declare all Russians obstinate or all Japanese yielding is to paint with a brush too broad and too simple. The wise negotiator perceives the contours of a culture not as unyielding barriers but as landscapes to navigate, understanding the subtle shifts and undercurrents that might sway the discourse at hand.\n\nTo enter the realm of another's culture is to see through the lenses of one's own, to draw comparisons that come unbidden. The path to understanding winds through history and prejudice alike, and judgment finds no purchase here. One must accept the world as it is, negotiate within its bounds, especially when one's footing is unsure, when the ground is unfamiliar. On foreign soil, respect for what is sacred and enduring becomes a bridge over the gulf of difference, guiding the players towards common ground.\n\nCulture, like a river, does not cleave neatly along national banks. Within the walls of a company, a culture of its own takes root, shaped by the hours demanded, the clothes worn, the words spoken or unspoken. Corporate culture, too, has its rituals, its codes, its silent agreements. Across the American landscape, from one corporation to the next, from urban sprawl to suburban quiet, diversity of thought flourishes. Where some cultures present a smoother surface, seeming uniform to an outsider’s gaze, they invite a deeper delve into the hidden depths below.\n\nTo grasp the essence of a culture is to understand the values that animate it. If a culture prizes honor or the harmony of the collective, a negotiator will guard against shaming his kin in the pursuit of victory. In contrast, a culture that values the hard bargain will not rush to a swift settlement. These truths are the backdrop to the play of negotiation, a stage set before the first words are spoken. Yet, beyond the broad strokes of culture, it behooves the negotiator to seek the man behind the mask, to understand the person across the table, for therein lies the key to fruitful dialogue.",
            "In the dim chambers of thought where men ponder the divine, two voices rise, ancient and solemn. The first belongs to Anselm, who speaks of God as a certainty within the heart's confines. He whispers that the divine does not wander in the realms beyond but dwells within, a truth unshaken by the winds of doubt. God, he says, exists in our understanding, so deeply wrought that to think Him not is to tread a path of impossibility. Anselm beckons us to seek not beyond the shadowed walls of our own soul, for there lies the proof, untouched by the world's clamor. Faith, he names it, this knowing without seeing, this light in the dark where reason falters.\n\nYet there comes another voice, that of Aquinas, who walks not by faith alone but by the hard stones of reason. He bids us look to the world, to the change and causation that mark its passage, to the degrees of being and the harmony that binds it all. He lays before us five paths, each a thread to the divine, spun from the fabric of logic itself. In this tapestry, God is not a whisper of the heart but a necessity of the mind, a piece in the puzzle unseen yet undeniable. To Aquinas, the world itself cries out the existence of God, needing no leap of faith but only the clear gaze of reason.\n\nAnd so, these two stand, their voices mingling in the echoes of time. Each speaks of God, yet in their telling, the divine wears different garbs. One whispers of faith's quiet certainty, the other of reason's steadfast march. And we are left to ponder their words, to wonder if the truth of God lies within or without, or if perhaps it is woven from both, a mystery both seen and unseen.",
            "In the world of letters, there are many ways to cast a shadow or a light upon the themes that haunt a story. Some methods strike deeper than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, he crafts his tale with a deft hand, employing a tapestry of techniques to evoke a sense of feeling or mood. At times, Fitzgerald marries words in a way that would seem strange, an adjective clinging to a noun, painting a scene with an aura all its own. Other times, he breathes life into symbols, colors that pulse with meaning. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink—all take on a life in his story. In his tale, Fitzgerald shapes the essence of these colors, white and gray, red and pink, folding them into the narrative like a subtle reminder of something felt but not seen.\n\nThe hues of white and gray become a canvas for uniformity, white tinged with a sheen of class, gray with the weight of age. From the story’s first breath, these colors whisper their meaning. Daisy and Jordan move like specters in their white dresses (8)—white is the color of choice. Nick dons white flannels (41) for Gatsby’s revelry, Tom’s shirt is white when he meets Myrtle (36), and Catherine’s face is powdered a milky white (30). When Nick surveys Gatsby’s party, the garish splash of primary colors breaks the spell of white (40). Fitzgerald casts white and gray over the ordinary, the mundane: the “white chasms of lower New York” where Nick toils (56), the names at Gatsby’s fêtes reduced to “gray names” (61), Catherine’s home a mere slice in “a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28). Common folk and places wear these hues as if they were a uniform: the “white girlhood” of Jordan and Daisy (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” of the valley of ashes (23), the “Italian child” steeped in gray (26), the dog-seller an old gray man (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sown the seeds of meaning within these colors, he turns them upon the characters, signaling their insignificance or conformity. Daisy becomes a specter in her “white” roadster, a ghost of desire that Gatsby chases (74). She fades to the background, a uniform shade against which longing is thrown into relief. The “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash (115), all serve to remind the reader of her spectral form, a figure made of longing and loss.",
            "In the sunlit scape of San Diego County, where the land breathes mildness and the sky lingers in perpetual azure, the earth yields its bounty. Tomatoes and citrus, greens that stretch leafy and bright under the golden arc of day, squash and broccoli, herbs and trees laden with peaches and lemons. Berries and honey and the sharp warmth of peppers. A land where organic dreams find root and flourish, their promise whispered among the groves and fields. Here, the earth's pulse beats with the rhythm of organic toil, and the market waits, hungry and hopeful, for the fruits of this labor. Eggs and milk, the rich yield of nature's gentle hand, find their way to eager tables. Farms open their gates to those who seek the solace of the land, the quiet joy of watching birds flit through the trees, the peace of a path untrodden but by the wild. \n\nThis is a land that makes its claim not only upon the soil, but upon the heart, drawing those who wish to shape its bounty with their sweat and vision. Programs abound to aid those who would walk this path, who would see the land not just as a field to plow, but as a tapestry to weave with care. They seek to marry the ancient whisper of the earth with the new hope of profit and purpose. \n\nYet, the path is not easy. Organic farming demands of the farmer what the earth demands of the seed—patience, labor, the willingness to nurture without the easy crutch of chemical aid. The land takes its toll in time and effort, each weed and pest a challenge to be met with hands and heart. The cost is high, the losses sometimes heavy, and the small farm stands alone against the might of larger foes. But there is beauty in the struggle, a richness in the diversity that blooms where chemicals dare not tread. \n\nThis landscape, this 160-acre sprawl of chaparral and oak, grasslands that whisper of the Mediterranean, this is where the dream takes shape. It lies at the border of the Cleveland National Forest, a breath of wilderness in the East County Southern Foothills. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its shadow here, a guardian of over a hundred voices of the wild—plants and creatures, some teetering on the brink, others already lost to time's relentless march. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies and birds, all hold their fragile court here. \n\nOnce, this land knew the tread of Native American feet, the lowing of cattle, the steady ring of axes hewing wood. It was homestead and livelihood, a place where hands shaped the earth for survival. Now, it waits for new tales to be written in its soil. I sought out this land, this place of possibility, and through the lens of a real estate screen, I imagined what might be. I found a farm, organic and hopeful, nestled in the same land, a beacon for what might come to pass.",
            "In the world, there exists a bond between brothers that is as immutable as stone and as binding as the earth itself. Within this bond lies a tumult of emotions: love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, emotions that weave through their lives like the roots of ancient trees. Brothers, they know each other as no other soul could, seeing themselves reflected in the eyes of the other. It is in the moments of deepest despair that the true nature of this bond surfaces, revealing its face whether it be benevolent or malevolent. And in such revelations lies a steep cost. To truly grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link, one must face the consequences they drag in their wake. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not through the lens of others but as he truly is. It is in the actions they take and the aftermath of those actions where their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers tread this path, exploring the tumultuous emotions that bind them. Through a landscape lush and vivid with life, they embark on a journey doomed from its inception. In the final act, bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride, leaving only one brother to walk away. The theme is drawn out through the stark characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, seen through the narrator's eyes, communicating the complexity of feelings that envelop the protagonist's world, shaping his every deed.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a singular force: pride. From the outset, when he first ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated outing, pride festers within him. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart his worldly skills, like holding his breath and running and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such fantasies crumbled to dust in the face of Doodle’s frailty. Born with a heart as fragile as spun glass, it was a wonder he survived at all, and to partake in such vigorous pursuits was beyond the realm of possibility. For the young protagonist, with his head full of dreams, such a revelation was a crushing blow. In his anger, he even contemplated the unthinkable act of smothering the life from the small child beneath a pillow. What kind of child entertains the notion of infanticide? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle bestows upon him a simple smile. A gesture so small, yet it kindles a flame of hope within him. His conviction, it seems, was never as strong as he believed, for deep within, there lay a primordial affection for his brother.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a wonder stands cloaked in mystery. As the world spun on its axis and the days unfurled into years, the way we likened this intricate organ to the world around us shifted and turned. Once it was but a wax tablet, then a papyrus, then a tome, and finally a machine of silicon and wires. Yet in this journey of understanding, let us not be deceived by these metaphors, for they hold truths as fragile as a spider’s web.\n\nThe dance of perception begins with the world’s touch upon our senses. The caress of air, the warmth of light, the murmur of sound—they are transformed into whispers of electric currents. The brain, with its unknowable algorithms, spins this raw tapestry into a vision. Through the lens of bottom-up and top-down processes, we piece together the world. A simple black box upon a canvas of white becomes more than mere shapes and colors. It is seen and known, not as a void but as form.\n\nYet, amidst this torrent of sensation, a sentinel stands guard—attention. It chooses what to heed and what to cast aside. Though the earth and sky may teem with countless details, our mind, in its wisdom, discerns the essential from the inconsequential. Like a name called out in a bustling hall, some signals pierce through the noise.\n\nFor the mind to weave its wonders, it must hold fast to memory. From the fleeting to the eternal, it stores its treasures. Each word, each sight, is encoded, preserved in the lattice of neurons or the dance of proteins. Memory lives in layers, ephemeral as a summer breeze or enduring as the mountains.\n\nIn seeking to understand this enigma, many have ventured forth with models and theories. Networks of meaning where thoughts are linked like stars in a constellation. A chair, a table, a wooden beam—all connected in the web of the mind, each node a beacon of understanding.\n\nAnd so, we journey on, into the depths of our own creation, seeking to know what cannot be fully known, to map the unchartable terrains of the human soul.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the throes of a merciless financial catastrophe. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market crumbled to dust, and titans of industry lay prostrate in the dirt, their foundations shaken to the core. The recession holds its grip even now, and thus we are compelled to question: what dark alchemy birthed this crisis, and how might we stave off its return? The tale is one of avarice and folly, of political machinations that drove banks and firms to cast sub-prime loans into a fragile and nascent financial edifice. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those monolithic entities, were not spared the pressure; they were driven to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into labyrinthine constructs of CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers faltered, as they were wont to do, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, and the ensuing chaos rippled through the repackaged mortgages, spilling forth into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the waning years of the Clinton era, in the year 1999. The President, his eyes set on a second term, sought to bolster his standing by loosening the chains of lending restrictions, thus sowing the seeds of the sub-prime crisis that would bloom seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a portentous tale in 1999: “Fannie Mae, the nation's mighty underwriter of home mortgages, has come under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to broaden the scope of mortgage loans among the lowly and the moderate, all the while feeling the weight of stockholders’ demands for continued profit growth.” Holmes’ words, like a prophet’s, foresaw the unraveling: “The government-subsidized corporation may find itself in peril should an economic storm gather, leading to a rescue reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.” And so it came to pass, as ill-fated lending practices laid waste to the economy.\n\nA multitude of forces conspired to cast the economy into a downward spiral, among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and the dread collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) wove themselves into the fabric of the housing market, entwining financial sectors with a perilous intimacy. The U.S. households, and indeed the financial markets at large, found themselves overextended, teetering on the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest tremor in pricing.\n\nAnd tremor it did. The housing bubble, engorged with false promise, finally burst, leaving financial institutions that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities to reckon with their hubris. The five great investment banks of the U.S. stood burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for a staggering 30 percent of the nation's GDP. The reckoning was swift and unforgiving: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were driven to seek refuge as commercial banks, their wings clipped by regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in $5 trillion of mortgage debt, were finally seized by the government’s hand in September of 2008.",
            "In the telling of tales there comes a moment when the writer stands poised at the precipice of creation, wings unfurled in the vast expanse of possibility. There, amidst the weaving of words, lies the perilous ground of exposition. A place where the unwary scribe may fall prey to the siren call of verbosity, drowning their readers in a deluge of facts and figures until the story itself is lost in a fog of needless detail.\n\nBeware, for exposition is a treacherous guide.\n\nThe wise among you have learned the lesson well: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even the most learned can falter, their pages heavy with the weight of words that neither move nor breathe. For exposition is a sly deceiver, whispering that the road to understanding is paved with the stones of history, that the past must be laid bare before the tale can take flight. But heed not its counsel, for therein lies the path to stagnation.\n\nConsider the tale of a woman and her love. Told in sparse lines, they met beneath a wide and open sky, were wed in grand celebration, and in one cruel stroke, he was taken from her. Such is the skeleton of the story, stark and bare. But to breathe life into these bones, one must attend to the heart of the matter, to the words unspoken and the moments shared. It is not enough to know they loved; we must see it in their eyes, hear it in their voices, feel it in the quiet spaces between.\n\nIn the weaving of their tale, the writer must draw the reader into the circle of their lives, binding them with threads of empathy and understanding. To know the man not by the fact of his existence, but by the warmth of his smile and the strength of his embrace. To see the woman through his eyes, and in her grief, find echoes of our own. Only then can the story take root, growing beyond the page into a living, breathing thing.\n\nSo, as you set forth upon your own journey, take heed. Do not rush to fill the silence with noise. Let the story unfold in its own time, each moment a step upon the path to revelation. For in the quiet spaces, in the pauses between words, lies the true heart of the tale. And it is there that the magic happens, when the story becomes not just a telling, but a living memory, etched upon the soul.",
            "In the early light of a day born of discord, I watched the flickering screen cast its shadows across the room, the voice from Columbus, Ohio, speaking of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had turned the dark of night darker still with a knife’s cruel edge. Ashley, Ohio bore witness to his hand, and they showed his face, a visage of unrepentant malevolence. They spared but a breath on him, the tale still unfurling like some poisonous vine around the morning hour, the scant details of a life cut and an arrest made.\n\nThe story shifted to another place, another soul, Travis Buyers, eighteen, left on the brink in Sharon Woods where the sun rose slow and heavy. No arrests, no faces to put to his pain. The SWAT team prowled the shadowed streets, and yet the story was brief, too brief, and I thought of how the world moves quick past the darkened skin of a man, the tales of their suffering muted in the din. The world watches when the fair-skinned fall, their stories a cacophony, but for others, silence.\n\nThere was talk of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet ripping the air, a .22 caliber that marked its passage through metal and sky. They offered five thousand dollars for the name of the one who pulled the trigger, a bounty on shadows.\n\nThe sky brooded over the weekend, rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties. A fleeting mention, a lure to keep eyes on the screen, the weather yet another player in the day’s unfolding drama.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, the Clime Road UDF in Columbus, a man cloaked in black skin and a hoodie. They lingered on his hue, the darkness of him, as if it were the crime itself. Six feet tall, one hundred fifty pounds, a specter in the night.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin from Texas, his empire crumbled by the law. Marijuana, they said, flowing from the south to Ohio, a river of green. Twenty-five years he would serve, they said, but called it three hundred months, as if the weight of years bore more heavily in numbers. Hispanic, they named him, though what the color of his skin had to do with the tale, I could not say.\n\nThe stories spun together, a tapestry of darkness and light, the screen a window to a world as distant as it was near.",
            "In the world of markets and trades, there exists a creature known as the ETF, an exchange traded fund. It is not unlike a ghostly shadow of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, mirroring their movements but with a grace of its own, dancing on the exchange floor as freely as any stock. The ETF carries within it the promise of diversification, the spread of risk across many, yet allows you the singular command of a lone stock. You can sell it short, buy on margin, own but a single share if you wish. And in this, it offers allure. Its expenses are but whispers compared to the clamor of mutual funds. Yet, every rose has its thorn, and here you must pay a commission each time you trade it, as you would with any stock. A cornucopia of choices lies before you, as varied as the stars, yet the wise must always question. Do these benefits, these promises of diversification, truly hold? And to what extent? \n\nOur gaze turns now to the ETF known as IHF, and we shall weigh it against the ten pillars that form its foundation. We seek to know if in owning this single entity, one might touch the same heights as holding a varied portfolio of ten stocks. Or perhaps, by rearranging these same stones, we might fashion a structure with greater strength or return. \n\nTo unravel this, we focus only on the chief ten holdings, which together form 63.58% of the ETF's entirety. Here, we present these ten, their presence marked in the landscape of assets.\n\nTo understand how these ten stand for the whole of IHF, we take their current standing, normalize it to a full hundred, and thus calculate each one's offering to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were they to stand alone in the proportions dictated by the ETF's design. These numbers, these calculations of Beta and return, are laid bare below.\n\nFrom this tableau, it becomes clear. A portfolio of these ten alone promises a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a leap of 16%. The Beta too, sits lower by .12 than that of the ETF entire. It seems then, a portfolio of these ten might offer more bounty with less risk. Yet, we must ponder if the means of these two, ETF and Ten, are truly different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern this, we turn to the deviations, the measure of each of the ten's wanderings from the path, and normalize these too to a hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF itself.",
            "In the third month, the numbers fell away like autumn leaves, and when one looked to the figure, there it was, plain as day. A drop precipitous and unbidden, and hard to reckon why. When winter settles upon New England, the cold turns folk away from their bicycles and their boots, and maybe that accounts for some of it. December, a season when the fall semester winds to its end, and minds are burdened with the weight of schoolwork and grades and the myriad tasks that fill the days. Perhaps those commuter logs slipped away into the shadows of forgetfulness. Then comes the holiday, a busy time, and with it a long respite from the halls of learning, a time when students and professors alike find no need to tread upon the campus grounds. When January comes, the classes resume, and therein perhaps lies a hint to the scarcity of logs for that month. Yet February remains a mystery, its numbers low, unexplained. Perhaps, as with all projects, there is a fervor at the beginning, an energy that wanes with time. To counter this, we fashioned a Carpool Challenge Week, a surge in March to stir the embers anew, and it bore fruit, the logs rising once more. And so it was that we found ourselves grappling with the ebb and flow of engagement, the natural decline, and the breaks that punctuate the academic calendar.  \nAnother trial was the lure of the open road, the freedom and ease that come with one's own vehicle, a love woven into the very fabric of our being. Incentives were needed, and so we offered them, prizes aplenty, gift certificates to local haunts and distant chains alike. Yet one wonders how the stakes might change with grander offerings—a fine bicycle, a gleaming hybrid, an electric steed. Would such temptations have staved off the lull we faced? The prizes remained constant, but had they grown in worth as the months wore on, there might have been a difference. Gift cards served us well at the start, but had we announced new prizes in December—a bicycle or two, and then in January, the promise of a car—one can only ponder if the tide might have turned, if the logs might have swelled instead of dwindling.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon the dusty scrolls of early Edison films, each frame a whisper from an era long past. Among these, a peculiar breed caught my eye, the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These were crafted with an alchemist's hand, employing the sorcery of the cut to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My journey through these flickering ghosts was one of charting the language of trickery, noting those few that strayed from the fold as the years waned. At the heart of these films lay a steadfast adherence to a world framed by the proscenium, static and unyielding, where each film was but a single breath, a solitary shot.\n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, confined within its painted borders, the camera an unwavering sentinel, fixed as fate. It was a tableau drawn from the theater, from vaudeville, from the dusty boards where magicians plied their craft. The actors moved as if bound to the earth, side to side, never daring to approach the lens that captured their antics. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) stands as a testament, its players entering from the right, traversing the horizontal as if the world itself were but a narrow strip. Even when they vanished beyond the frame's edge, the camera held its ground, unmoving.\n\nThese films were composed in long shots, the rare medium shot a whisper of intimacy never fully realized. The close-up was an unknown land, unexplored, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville left the audience at a distance, observing the whole of the stage at once. The actors remained in the middle ground, the camera a distant observer, never inviting a closer gaze.\n\nMost trick films found their life in a singular concept, a lone shot that defined the whole. Their brevity was as a breath held, seldom more than a minute in length, each frame a flicker of vaudevillian spectacle—magic acts, vanishing illusions, transformations—bereft of narrative weight. Yet, within these films, a shot to the viewer's eye was not always as it seemed. The illusion demanded a deft hand, stitching together fragments of reality to conjure the impossible. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a cunning example, the moment of her doomed head's severance buried within the cut, a single shot to the untrained eye, yet a patchwork of frames beneath the surface.",
            "In the shadows of literature's past, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction, an \"Old-New\" conundrum as Ian Watt might have it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic form has wandered through the halls of critique, derided and praised, its depths questioned, yet its 'terrible sublime' nature extolled (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto gave birth to this genre, melding the ancient with the modern, forging a new path in the wilderness of words. Walpole drew from the old stage with its dramatic echoes and the new mimicry of nature found in the 'modern' novels to weave what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This Gothic tale hearkens back to the medieval echoes of theatre, architecture, traditions. Even in the twilight of Otranto's release, \"gothic\" was a term cast upon many peoples, styles, epochs. Seen as old, unsophisticated against the bright mirror of \"modern\" progress, it clung to its theatrical roots even as it embraced the novel's new form, allowing the reader to peer into the souls of its characters. Thus, Gothic endured, timeless yet obsolete, new to the eyes of readers lost in the web of time.\n\nWithin these Gothic tomes, the notion of Chivalry looms large. This medieval path of the knight, both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, for Gothic writers, stood as a beacon of what was once noble and brave and capable, a reflection of what they deemed absent in their world. The chivalric past, idealized, romanticized, whispers of the Gothic's future dance with Romanticism, striving to mold the present anew. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil, despaired for the days to come. Swathed in politics and shadowed by accusations, he perhaps pondered, if not openly, the loss of inherent morality, the 'goodness' of the Gothic age, now vanished in the hearts of his contemporaries. This struggle breathes through his characters, as seen in Frederic. Before Frederic steps into the light, the reader senses his chivalric aura; a prince, wounded by life, touched by tragedy, presumed lost to the infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" his image swells with exaggeration, heralding the Gothic excess yet to come (66).",
            "In the vast sprawl of commerce where the world drags its goods from one end of the earth to the other, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. This stream of processes, born from the mind of Keith Oliver in the year 1982, moves like a river that knows no rest, carrying the burdens of order from the moment a customer desires to the raw pulse of materials, through the labor of hands and machines, to the place where the goods find their peace in the hands of those who want them. There are six stone pillars upon which this edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of those who guide the chain, the managers who bend the will of the world to offer service to those who ask it.\n\nProduction begins the tale, the first note in a symphony. It is the foundation upon which all else rests, the moment when the thoughts of what, when, where, and how take shape. It demands a keen eye on the market, the silent whisper of the people's desires, a guide in the wilderness. Here, decisions are made, the future drawn up in numbers and plans, the where and the how taking form as managers ponder the place and the machinery, the rhythm of time and the wear of tools. It is a step heavy with import, each misstep a cost of time and fortune. In the world of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the design, the booklet, the process that guides every hand and every step, a map in the wilderness of commerce. It is this clarity that keeps the wheels turning, the confusion at bay.\n\nNext comes the matter of supply, the second stone in the chain. Here lie the strategic decisions, the core capabilities that define a place, the partnerships that grow like vines from decisions made. A company may split its soul, dividing the labor across many lands and hands, each with its own tools and talents. Here, the manager decides where to place the burden, which division or partner shall carry the weight. They may choose to let another carry the load, to outsource the work, and in this choice find speed, find flexibility, while holding the costs at bay.\n\nAnd so the chain winds on, a path through the wilds of commerce, each step a dance, each decision a note in the song of the world.",
            "In the grim tapestry of Victorian literature, where the minutiae of societal hierarchy often stand as the canvas, there exists a divergence in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like strange constellations in the night sky, bear the mysteries and the grotesqueries that set them apart from their contemporaries, infusing their characters with the haunted depth of dreams and enigmas. Here, motivations and emotions are laid bare as if under the light of a spectral moon.\n\nIn Oliver’s world, there is no peace. Ideas swarm his mind like spectres, and he walks not in the company of the living but with the echoes of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a discordant symphony in his ears. Even as he speaks, it is not to the world around him but to the phantoms of his consciousness. A gunshot rings out, shattering the air, and he is swept away by an unseen force, a maelstrom of sound and chaos engulfing him. Through this tumult, a gnawing pain lurks, an ever-present torment that knows no respite. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels paint the landscape of mystery often with the brush of dreams or the dreamlike, each stroke differing in its intent and revelation. In Oliver Twist, these visions unveil the hidden corridors of Oliver's soul, the shadows of his anguish, and the dawning of his understanding of the world’s cruel truths. In the retelling of his shooting, Oliver is ensnared in a vivid reverie, seeking aid in a world that spins beyond his grasp. The passage underscores his impotence amidst the chaos that surrounds him, the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit a testament to the abyss in his spirit. He is borne away, numb to the touch of the unseen hand, experiencing anew the despair born not from the sting of pain but from the fear that clings to his bones. The specter of this event raises the question of whose will guides his fate, for it is not his own. The shooting becomes a mirror to his helplessness, a reflection of his inability to seize control even as death looms. There is a whisper of defeat in this narrative, as if Fagin's shadow has begun to claim him, thrusting him deeper into a chasm of despair, shackling his will to resist. Otherwise, one might presume he would have struggled for the sake of survival, if only to grasp at life’s fleeting promise.\n\nTime ebbs and flows, neither day nor night holding dominion. Time is a specter, gone as soon as it arrives, and night descends once more; a night that stretches endlessly in its oppressive silence, yet slips away in its brief, haunted hours.",
            "In the dimming years past, I found myself in the hushed corridors of an after-school program, a haven for children seeking solace in books and numbers. Among them was a boy, Adrian by name, caught in a struggle with the written word. He was a small thing, perhaps in his third or fourth year of schooling, and the letters danced before him like shadows on a wall, some clear as a bell, others lost in a haze. He was Latino, that much was true, yet his English was as flawless as the summer sky.\n\nWe battled on, Adrian and I, until the day his mother came. I was minding the stragglers left behind from a field trip when she walked through the door. Her tongue was Spanish, mine barely so, but we exchanged what we could in broken phrases. It struck me then, like a sudden thunderclap, that Adrian's foe was not the words but the alphabet itself. He was a boy adrift between two worlds, and I wondered if my revelation brought him any peace. I hope, in the quiet moments, that it did.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light on the silent barrier that is language in our schools, especially here in California. It is a barrier unseen, even to those who speak the tongue with ease. For Adrian, the cure was simple: tutoring in the letters and sounds of English. But for others, those whose voices are new to this land, the path is twisted and long. There is no single answer. The dual language system, immersion, tutors, ESL classes—none alone will mend this tear. It is in their weaving together that hope lies.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child, but for all. Studies whisper of its success, of children who rise above their peers. Fear hovers over this notion, fear that it is folly, a waste. But it is not so. If we embraced this as the way, rather than the exception, all children might flourish. How then do we proceed? Must every teacher wield two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot place by their side aides, tutors, call them what you will, who speak in two voices.",
            "From the time we are children, we are told of things vast and incomprehensible, whispers of something greater that looms just beyond the reach of our understanding. Some are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still others search within the confines of their own hearts for the answers. Many of us embrace the faiths handed down by those before us, while some cast them aside, denying anything beyond the orbit of their own solitary universe. We may cling to one set of beliefs only to shed them for another as we wander. Whatever path is chosen, the journey shapes us, guided by our own visions of the divine. We seek a beacon in the darkness, a light to lead us from the shadows into the day.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch of our house, the rain a relentless tide upon the tin roof above, cigarettes between our fingers. The gutters spilled their burden, drowning the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a stare that seemed to reach for something unseen, part quest, part memory. He had grown thinner, his clothes draping his frame like a forgotten memory. His hair, too, had waned, sparser than I recalled. He avoided my eyes, gazing into the rain as if it might offer answers. I felt the solitude of that moment, fear clinging to me as I realized I could not speak of how much I would miss him. Words would give weight to the reality we both wished to deny. I embraced him, drew my chair nearer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father departed this world in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased his pain, merely stretched his days beyond what the doctors foresaw. I pondered what value lay in such suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered in the solitude of night. I uttered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased to heed my voice long ago.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. So I did not. I could not bear to watch the life that gave me breath as it flickered out. I wanted to hold the memory of his living, not his dying. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin. I knew he would not want me as a witness to his end. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nAnd no one even called.",
            "In the early days of this great land, there was a man named John Taylor of Caroline, a soul deeply tethered to the soil, who spoke with fervor for the cause of Republicanism. Though his hands were calloused by the plow, his brief brush with the relentless winds of politics shaped him into a figure known for his steadfastness and his voice, ever rising in defense of the liberty of men and the governance that would allow it. His creed lay in the furrows of the earth, for it was the agrarian life he held above all, believing it to be the noblest of pursuits, and it was this belief that painted his views on the nature of sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the courts of law.\n\nTaylor held within him a vision of a land unshackled by the chains of history. He saw a nation where the absence of ancient traditions was not a void but a canvas to inscribe a new order, a self-governance that could stand as a beacon to the world. He spoke of the inalienable rights bestowed upon all men, each linked inexorably to the other, so that to deny one was to unravel the very tapestry of freedom. Such rights, he contended, must remain beyond the reach of any government’s grasp. He understood the world as a place where, in its most primal state, those with strength and cunning would thrive at the expense of the weak, but civilization, he argued, must not mirror this savage truth.\n\nIn his mind, Taylor saw the blueprint of an ideal society, one where the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both light and dark. He was unyielding in his belief in a morality cleaved in two. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he declared. A good government, he argued, was one that protected the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and held at bay the tides of unchecked capitalism. For even in a system led by those driven by greed and self-interest, a government founded on these good principles would stand just and true. Self-interest, he believed, drove all men, but it was only when this trait led to the exploitation of others that it took on the guise of evil. Thus, a vigilant government was needed to temper man's inherent wickedness and to guard against the insidious creep of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, called for a Constitution interpreted with the utmost rigor. He envisioned a Federal government hemmed in by the strict bounds of the written word, no more powers than those clearly penned by the founders. He knew well the cost of an expansive government, the shadow of despotism it cast. Yet he warned against a reading too simple, too literal, for without the spirit of the founders to guide it, such an interpretation could be twisted to serve dark ends. To Taylor, it was the Declaration of Independence that rang truest, a document that spoke of a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation, and in this he placed his faith.",
            "He stood gazing downwards, his mind a blank canvas, absorbing the view before him. With a practiced detachment he studied the scene, his thoughts moving in and out like shadows in the mind, leaving no trace. It seemed as though he had no thoughts to call his own, just a fluid experience of the sight before him.\n\nOnce, heeded the advice of an artist he knew, he bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He had wanted to draw since he was a child, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil's touch to the brain's dance with lines. In its pages, it spoke of framing the picture, a technique to capture the chaos of detail, like a bowl of fruit amidst kitchen clutter, into a simple tableau. \n\nBut now, as he stared at the bowl before him, he could not summon that artist's frame. Overwhelmed, he stood, filled with a sense of awe. Like Picasso's blue, Monet's greenery, or the Renaissance's rainbowed masters, if his vision had any claim to artistry, this was the genesis of his Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers found their tool, muscles coiled and relaxed, shaping the intent of his mind into the world, crafting perhaps his life's most creative act. Water swirled, serene and clear, dissolving fragments into the void. Muscles tightened, jerked, spasmed, and his hand struck the handle again. The stubborn brown refuse clung to the porcelain, unmoving, like a slug.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set firm, tie tight around his throat, he frowned at the insolent mass left for the hapless cleaners of Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand moved to the wall for the roll of paper. It wrapped around his hand, forming a makeshift oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending low, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dim light of dawn, the roads stretch out like a silent promise, but too often they bear witness to the tragedy of youth. Young lives, untested and unready, find themselves at the wheel of death's chariot, a truth as stark as the asphalt beneath them. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, still forming, not yet sculpted to navigate the perils of the road. Inexperience, like a shadow, lingers in every turn and misstep, leading to the tolling bells of rolled vehicles and lives lost. \n\nWhen they gather, these young souls, in the company of their peers, the odds darken further. Common sense long departed, they ride together, unaware of the silent calculus that plays out with each mile. A study in California, that land of sun and shadow, reveals the grim correlation: the younger the passengers, the greater the likelihood of calamity.\n\nStates like California have tried to weave a tapestry of safety with provisional licenses, a patchwork of rules to limit the night wanderings and companionship on the road. Yet these are but bandages over a wound that runs deep. As a group, the youngest among us are ill-prepared for the weight of this responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts doubt even on the age of eighteen, suggesting the reckless thrill-seeking of youth is a fire not yet cooled.\n\nWe stand on the precipice of time, gazing into a future where the road will fill with the offspring of the Baby Boomers. By 2010, the highways will swarm with these nascent drivers, each car a potential harbinger of disaster. The legislation needed is clear, straightforward as the horizon line. Schools could still shape the minds of future drivers, but the age to take the wheel should be set no lower than eighteen. A provisional pass, a rite of passage before full freedom, would still be necessary, along with hours spent under the guiding eyes of an elder.\n\nFrom the breadth of this land, a uniform law could rise, a shield for the youth who walk the thin line between life and the unknown. This is no novel suggestion, but one borne of necessity, a call to protect those who do not yet know the value of their own lives.",
            "The paper at hand traverses the landscape of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, drawing a map across three distinct territories. First, an understanding of the disorder is conjured briefly upon the page. Thereafter, the means of diagnosis are laid bare, those telltale signs that signal its presence. In the end, the paper unfurls ways by which a teacher, stationed within the confines of a mainstream classroom, can lend their hand to a student shadowed by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, known too as Auditory Processing Disorder, speaks to the manner by which the central nervous system—those tangled webs of thought and perception—takes in the world of sound. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, back in the year of 2005, penned words that captured its essence: a disorder where the brain, in its silent complexity, struggles to grasp the sounds that come its way. Those afflicted hear as any other, their ears unimpeded, yet something in the brain’s labyrinthine corridors does not work as it ought—a failure to parse words from the din, to sieve conversation from the noise.\n\nThe earliest whisperings of what would come to be known as CAPD find their root in the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder bore the name of \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers then began to pick apart the threads of communication disorders in children. An Italian cohort, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, embarked upon this journey in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing, crafting a model to fathom the workings of the auditory system that resides in our depths. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled a fire for research on children beset by CAPD.\n\nThe disorder shows its face in myriad forms: a person may lose the sound's position in the world, struggle to discern one sound from another, fail to catch the patterns in the noise. They might not sense the shifts in speech, the undercurrents of sarcasm carried by a voice’s subtle change. A sound may be blotted out by what follows it, the sequence lost to them. They might find themselves adrift, unable to make sense of the sounds that reach them, to act upon the clues they hold. \n\nDiagnosis comes through the lens of systematic observation, the patient’s listening behavior and auditory function tested by those skilled in the art—be they audiologists, psychologists, or others versed in such measures. Tools and tests abound, yet none claim the throne of high success. The cause of the disorder remains elusive, a shadow without form. Tests often bombard the patient with a cacophony, asking them to pick through the noise for words, numbers, meaning. Some delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses that ripple back.",
            "In the quiet solitude of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, where the suffering of children echoes like a distant thunder in my heart. The Division of Family and Children Services calls to me, a siren song to mend the broken lives of the abused and the neglected, to offer solace to families teetering on the brink. Service, respect, an ethical compass—these are the lodestars I hold dear. A commitment to bind the frayed threads between souls and to seek within myself the growth necessary to remain steadfast and true in my calling. These values, though the lifeblood of the social worker, are the very marrow of my being.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, the urge to heal others has been a constant companion, though the form it would take was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many fled from their demons, and others sought refuge in hollow comforts. Such scenes etched themselves upon my psyche, guiding me toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead lay cloaked in mist. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I paused, breathing in the summer air, wondering where it might lead me. On a languid day, a friend beckoned me to her home, where I found a boy of sixteen, eyes flickering with fear, seated uneasily on her couch. His tale unfolded—a life marred by the cruelty of those who should have been his guardians. The following day, he summoned the law to his parents' door. I drove there, determined to aid him if I could. Behind closed doors, I confided my concerns to the officers, my degree from Piedmont College lending weight to my words. They, in turn, sought my voice to speak with the boy’s parents, for the law's hands were bound. Their eyes darted nervously, weaving tales to cloak their son’s cries for help as mere manipulations, \"simple\" disputes they claimed. This encounter, stark in its clarity, turned my gaze firmly toward social work, to shepherd children lost amidst such \"simple\" familial storms.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the realm of social work, a beacon in the darkness. We, as a society, extol the individual, mourning those who fade into memory. Yet, this vaunted individuality often bows to the weight of ancient customs, a contradiction I cannot abide. I am a lone voice, resisting the shackles of conformity. High school and college saw my rebellion against the injustices of our world: my hair a riot of hues, my attire a canvas of my spirit, the piercings a testament to my defiance. I stood with GSBA, my voice rising against the scourge of racism and discrimination. Social justice is my creed, and I shall not waver in my stand against the injustices that mar our society's soul.",
            "In the stillness of the night where sleep forsakes the weary, we turn to the contemplation of the models that seek to explain this restless plight known as insomnia. There are the biological models, rooted in the flesh and the blood, the genes that sing and the neurons that speak in silence. And there are the sociocultural models, the invisible hand that shapes the soul, the race, the creed, the standing in a world that turns indifferent. This paper lays bare the dissection of these models, each piece of research unearthed as one would a relic from the dust, to better understand the tale they tell. Their revelations, the clarity and the void, are weighed with the care of a judge passing sentence.\n\nA sleep disorder is a shadow cast in many forms. It may stand alone, a primary affliction, or it may cling to the darkness of another mind's turmoil. It may arise from the body's betrayal or the poisons we take within. The Dyssomnias and the Parasomnias, these are the names we give to the specters of the night. Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and their kin, they walk the line between waking and oblivion. The nightmares, the terrors, the wandering in sleep, these are the echoes of the Parasomnias. For some, the disorder is a reflection of the mind's greater unrest, a mirror to an Axis I or II affliction. This review seeks to unravel insomnia, and by its light, cast a gaze upon the broader tapestry of sleep's disquiet in the context of the biological and the sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of the biological, the inheritance of sleep's misfortune lies in the marrow and the synapse. The neurons in the hypothalamus, bearers of orexin, hold dominion over the cycles of sleep and wake. In the silent study of mice, a truth is glimpsed: the GABAB receptors on these neurons are the gatekeepers of slumber. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, ushers in the quietude of sleep. But to silence it is to court anxiety's embrace and deny repose. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the night’s gentle embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, we glean a whisper of understanding, that what holds true for mouse may hold true for man, that the genetic tapestry of our being weaves this tale. The absence or flaw in this receptor might cast one adrift in wakefulness, beyond the reach of medicine. The sociocultural shadow of this knowledge is that should the trait be passed down, it would alter the sleep of the inheritor, rippling through life’s pursuits, the mundane and the meaningful, a hindrance in the monotony of the everyday.",
            "He had come to know the sprawl of University Park, a place he had wandered for nigh on two and a half years, or four and a half semesters in the reckoning of the school’s calendar. For many, and he counted himself among them, the vastness of the campus was a thing to be reckoned with. His first year, they had put him in an East Halls dormitory, out on the eastern edge of the known world if one discounted the distant stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, he would set out on foot toward the heart of this academic wilderness, places like Willard building, where the learned gathered. It was a trek that could stretch to twenty-five minutes if the skies darkened, as they were wont to do in State College. An alum, not long gone from these halls, had spoken of days when East Halls stood solitary, separated from the university by fields of untamed land. But time and progress had filled that void with sports fields and edifices of brick and mortar—the new Creamery, the health services building, apartments rising like stones in a field. With growth came struggle, the challenge of moving from one place to another more pronounced. What then, was the remedy for such tribulation? On this campus, it was the bicycle. But wheels alone would not suffice. Riders were needed, and the paths must be paved for their passage.\n\nHe had spoken with a friend who had taken to cycling again after years adrift. The friend, in his newfound wisdom, had wondered why he had ever ceased. “Bikes are great,” he had said. “For a while, it seemed uncool, but it’s the only way to traverse this place.” The bicycle, he knew, was the most efficient means of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel a journey of thirty miles or more. Like many of his kind, he had taken residence off-campus, a journey from the center as far-flung as any dorm. The wisest choice he had made was to procure a bicycle. Each day, he made his way to Thomas building, a place twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but a mere five if he pressed hard upon the pedals. Yet, Pollock Road, the swiftest route to Thomas, was a path fraught with difficulty, bicycle or not. There were virtues in walking, but he found himself too burdened by the weight of time. Without his bicycle, he would have no choice but to trudge on foot. Such a walk to Thomas would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from his day. Over a week, that was more than two and a half hours. And when he considered all the other journeys he must make, to classes, to appointments, that was time he could not afford to lose.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the specter of technology and capitalism entwined, crafting a bleak tapestry where the individual is a mere whisper lost in the roar of the collective. Here, community reigns supreme, and from the cradle, souls are molded to chase fleeting pleasures, their gaze never lifting from the shallow trough of immediate gratification. They are pawns in a grander scheme, shackled to a singular doctrine by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's wary eye cast upon these burgeoning systems. His narrative drips with the lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—each word a stone in the edifice of his critique against the economic machine rising in his era.\n\nCapitalism stands lampooned under the Marxist banner of false consciousness, a shroud that blinds the populace to the true nature of their class tetherings, ensnaring them in self-interest. Ideological reins guide the proletariat, their strings pulled by those in power, a truth laid bare in the conditioned masses of Huxley's world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk wander without true will, their minds lulled by hypnopædia into a ceaseless cycle of consumption and indulgence. The World Controller orchestrates this facade, weaving hegemony's threads to bind social classes beneath an unyielding hierarchy, where the ignorant buy into a system that chains them. Even the Alphas and Betas, except for outliers like Bernard, slumber in complicity, their awareness a dormant ember.\n\nIn this barren land, relationships fall away like dust, the characters rendered as shadows, void of depth. Perhaps Huxley whispers that the confluence of technology and capitalism erodes the spirit, stripping man of will and voice. Love is a forgotten legend; emotions are muted shades, interactions mere surface ripples. Men speak of women in terms vacuous and crass, while women recount their liaisons with a brazen air. Each class, content in its station, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism, their unwavering loyalty a testament to Marxist visions of the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy as long as they tread the path of consumption, obedience, and conformity.\n\nThus, Huxley paints his cautionary tale, the ashes of individuality scattered by the winds of progress and profit.",
            "Four winters past in a classroom at CBC where I first took up the study of Islam, there were voices raised in fervent debate over the nature of its creed. Was it a faith marred by the stain of hostility? I reckon now that this question holds even more weight in the present day's light. The years since the towers fell have seen the great wheel of mass media spin from suspicion and fear to a curious acceptance of Islam within these American shores. Back then, it would have seemed unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, with his roots entwined in the Muslim world, to stand upon the threshold of the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad, as set down in the pages of his biography, caught my interest with its paradoxes. From what I had gathered, Muhammad was a man who wielded the sword to spread his faith, subjugating tribes and compelling them to embrace Islam. Yet, this biography paints him as a martyr misunderstood, a man of humility who drew followers not by force, but through the quiet power of his teachings. They came, one by one, seeking the light of what he spoke.\n\nAnd in those stories, one finds echoes of another. The ministry of Jesus, whose miracles are known to the world, and the acts ascribed to Muhammad bear a strange likeness. Such as when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, a reflection of the loaves and fishes. It seems the writers would have Muhammad seen as a prophet whose life was a testament to truth and wonder, not needing to prove what was plain. But this shadowing of Jesus' own miracles seems to me an unjust imitation, a borrowing that diminishes the marvels of Christ.\n\nThe tales of conversion in Muhammad's biography stand as testaments, or so they claim. Yet, they are tales told at a distance, passed from one to another like echoes in a canyon. I found myself distrustful of these accounts, for their circuitous origins seemed to weaken rather than strengthen their claims to truth.\n\nWhat sits uneasily with me is the portrayal of Muhammad as a figure of divine grace, gentle and wise beyond measure. For history, as I know it, paints a different picture, one that does not align with the gentleness ascribed to him. I wonder if those who follow him today see this history for what it is, or if they are content with the visage crafted by those who came after.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the voice of Jesus lingered, a whisper among the clamor of men who would shape it to their own ends. His words, once simple and clear, became tangled in the thoughts of those who followed. The path of Christianity veered away, like a river twisting from its source, until it bore scant resemblance to what it had been at its inception. Yet now, in the shadow of the world, there stirs an awareness—a slow awakening to the distance traveled from the origin. The world, in its ceaseless motion, moves towards progress. And yet there are those who cling to the past, their grip firm upon traditions handed down, unwilling to see beyond the veil of what they've known.\n\nAmong the faithful, there comes a yearning, a thirst for the truth as it was first poured. To peel away the layers of doctrine accrued over the centuries, like peeling bark from an ancient tree, to find the heartwood within. It is a journey that will not be swift. Decades, perhaps centuries, will pass before the tide turns fully. But the turning is inevitable, as sure as the sun will rise. The clock moves backward, unwinding the threads of history to reveal the tapestry as it was first woven.\n\nIn this great unraveling, there grows a movement—a return to the essence, the core of what Jesus, the man, sought to impart. As this wave sweeps across lands and seas, the church will stand steadfast, a beacon guiding those who seek. Yet as the theological clock rewinds, the myriad voices of Christendom will find harmony, the cacophony of belief yielding to a singular tune. Borders and divisions will fall away, leaving only unity in their wake. History is rich with reversals. Once, Christians were the hunted, the outcasts, scourged by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later don the mantle of their faith. Our own nation has turned from the chains of slavery to embrace leadership from those once bound.\n\nThis coming reversion will play out upon the stage of Christendom, a grand undoing in search of the source. Diversity, once celebrated, will give way to a singular truth. And this will be made possible by reading the words of Jesus not as ironclad edicts, but as metaphors, rich with meaning and open to interpretation.\n\nSo what, then, happened since the days when Jesus walked the earth? Cast your gaze far into the past, and you find Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted. Monotheism, the divine touch upon the world, and the Hebrew scriptures held sway when the Roman legions marched into Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But even then, the Jewish people were not of one mind. Divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each held their own vision of what should be. Yet from this crucible of belief, something new was forged.",
            "In the heart of the city where smoke rose like a dark river against the sky, there was a place where men worked themselves into the ground, driven by the greed of those above them. The air was thick with the stench of industry, a testament to the insatiable hunger of men who would grow their empires regardless of the cost. The Jungle laid bare this truth, a tale of ambition and disregard, where the mighty chimneys spewed their filth, heedless of the lives they choked beneath their shadows.\n\nThe factory owners, their eyes fixed on profit, cared little for the souls toiling in the bellies of their machines. Sinclair's words cut through the smoke, revealing a world where human worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. There was no room for loyalty, no place where decency might find a foothold. In this seething pit of jealousy and hatred, men were cast aside without thought, their labor spent and their lives discarded as easily as the refuse that lined the streets of Packingtown.\n\nIn those days, the law was silent, and the workers bore their burdens alone. The managers, unchecked, drove them harder, faster, into the maw of progress. The conditions were brutal, relentless, and the people who endured them were little more than slaves to a system that offered no escape. Even the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, turned against them, profiting from their plight.\n\nSinclair painted a world where survival teetered on the edge of starvation, where morality was as scarce as the warmth of the sun through the smoke. The men who held the reins were as ruthless as any slave driver, and under their rule, the city was a place of despair. In the eyes of the workers, there was no end, no respite, only the endless grind of a world that turned without care or compassion. And so they labored, caught in the web of their own making, bound to the whims of those who held their fate in callous hands.",
            "In the shadowlands of Edgar Allan Poe’s mind, there lay a poem he deemed among his finest—“Dream-Land.” Within its verses, the word “Thulé” emerges, twice invoked as if to bind the spectral narrative at its edges. Mabbott traces this term’s lineage back to Virgil, who spoke of Thulé as an island adrift at the world's edge, north of Britain, where the known world frayed into myth. Yet Virgil’s voice is not the only echo in Poe’s work. The Germanic allure, the whispering of Goethe’s pen, held sway over him.\n\nThis tether to Goethe is no mere shadow. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" threads a connection between their verses, positing that Poe wandered in the paths Goethe once trod. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, celebrant of the poetic drama “Faust,” which unfurled in two acts, the first in 1808, the last in the breath of Goethe’s own departure in 1832. Within Faust’s latter part, a poem named “The King of Thulé” resides—a tale of a king, whose queen’s parting gift, a goblet, became his anchor to memory and sorrow. He drank deeply from it, and when the weight of life pressed too heavily, he cast the goblet to the sea and followed it into the abyss.\n\nThe king’s lament, his isolation, and his descent into shadow echo the landscape of Poe’s “Dream-Land,” where the speaker wanders amid the ghosts of friends and a world devoid of hue. It is as if Poe stood at the edge of Goethe’s creation, a dark reflection of his own losses and the solace he found in drink. The resonance of Thulé also reached “The Pit and the Pendulum” less than a year before, marking Poe’s fascination with the term.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thulé straddles his oeuvre, a spectral thread linking “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “Dream-Land.” The two pieces breathe as companions, “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” entwined. Thulé, in Poe’s vision, is a realm of desolation, haunted, a vista of shadows much like the mournful king’s domain in Goethe’s dirge. Poe steps into Goethe’s lament, his own sorrows mirrored in the king’s fatal gesture.\n\nIn Goethe, Poe found a kinship, drawn not only by the pull of Tennyson’s name but by the very tide of reproductions that carried Goethe’s work across time and place, into Poe’s own hands. The German poet’s influence seeped into the fibers of Poe’s being, a spectral dialogue across the ages.",
            "In the state of California, the question arises whether a patron, finding herself sprawled upon the floor of a grocery store, having slipped upon an ungainly puddle of applesauce left untended, might claim punitive damages with the assertion that the store's overseer acted with malice. The tale unfolds thus: though twice informed of the treacherous mess, the manager, with indifference borne of hunger, delayed its removal for the sake of his supper.\n\nThe court, in its deliberation, would be hesitant to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense without due consideration. For the law demands evidence of a reckless and conscious disregard for the inevitable harm that such negligence might bring, conduct that courts must find despicable in its essence. Palmer, in her lament, shall argue that the manager, one Martin by name, ought to have foreseen the peril of leaving the spill uncleansed, for the annals of the store bore witness to numerous such misfortunes in the months preceding her own calamity. Yet, with such foreknowledge, Martin remained inert.\n\nThe charge of despicable conduct may seem less robust, yet Palmer’s case holds ground, given the history of six prior slip-and-fall mishaps within that fateful year of 2009, all under Martin’s watchful eye, and still, no measures did he take to secure the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn a day marked by the unlucky digits of October 13, in the year two thousand and nine, as the clock struck five in the evening, a missive was delivered by Rich Wayne, a loyal employee of D&D Markets, to his superior, Paul Martin. The message was clear: an applesauce spill sullied an aisle. But Martin, ensconced in his meal, dismissed it with a wave, claiming no time for such trifles. A quarter of an hour passed, and another messenger, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his neglect, offered the same reply. At the half-hour's mark, Jennifer Palmer, unsuspecting, found her footing lost, and with it, her well-being, as she met the unforgiving ground, her back injured.\n\nThe annals of that year recorded five prior slip-and-fall encounters at the establishment known as D&D. Now, Palmer seeks reparations both compensatory and punitive for her trials, and the question put forth is whether to seek a partial dismissal of her claim for punitive damages.\n\nUnder the statutes of California, a grievance unmoored from contractual bounds may yield punitive damages if it is shown that the wrongdoer acted with oppression, fraud, or malice as defined by law. Malice, in this context, would be an act intended to cause harm, or if not by intent, then by despicable conduct carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The courts have seen fit to label as malicious those acts undertaken with such disregard, where the defendant was aware of the likely harm their actions might cause, yet chose, with deliberation, to ignore the perilous outcomes. Such is the precedent set in the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co.\n\nThus, the tale is set before the court, the outcome yet to be written in the annals of justice.",
            "She'd always felt it, that yearning, a need that would not be sated, a hunger that gnawed at the edges of her young soul. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the unruly world of adolescence. And now, three years on at seventeen, it lingered still, a shadow cast over her days. She'd come to reckon it was someone she sought, not something, and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They'd come, awkward and earnest, those boys, with their clumsy overtures, but none could breach the fortress of her indifference. She'd pondered this anomaly, puzzled over this disquiet that set her apart from other girls her age, but no answer came. Just theories, frail and unsatisfying, and so she moved through her life, questioning her desires in silence.\n\nHome was a sanctuary, a place of peace. Her parents were good folk, calm and even-tempered, their disagreements rare and fleeting like the last rays of sunlight. Their quarrels with her were rarer still, mostly confined to her own assertions of independence, her spirited rebellion against their gentle rule. She was their daughter, their bright and lively counterpoint, her vivacity a beacon that drew others to her, an easy charm that endeared her to many.\n\nBut today peace was a stranger. She wandered from room to room, seeking some new spark for her restless mind, when a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, her mother's voice like a bell tolling in the quiet. Panic rose in her, a swift tide, and she flew to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay there, crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face as she gasped out \"Ow\" with each shallow breath. The girl knelt beside her, her hand gentle on her mother's arm, her voice steady. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came in a rush, strained and urgent, and the daughter could see the depths of her mother's suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" With her mother's guidance, she gathered her strength, grateful for the lessons that had taught her how to bear such a burden. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic smells and whispered fears, but these she did not notice, her mind fixed on her mother, her heart a drum in her chest. She bore the injured woman inside, her voice rising above the sterile clamor, summoning aid. Faces turned, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was brought, her mother lifted onto it, whisked away to where she could be cared for. And there the daughter sat, alone with her worry, the minutes stretching into hours.\n\nHer mother had fallen, toppled from a stool in her quest for a vase that rested beyond her reach, high up in the kitchen's tallest cupboard.",
            "In the quiet corridors of study and the echo of diligent footsteps, a journey took place, a search for truth amid the patterns of life and the whispers of mortality. The Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of ancient customs and sun-drenched lands, was laid bare in its essence. A score, an alternate Mediterranean score they called it, a quantification of the diet's embrace, a beacon against the shadow of chronic heart disease and the silent thief of stroke.\n\nThis score, this marker, was a reflection of the earth's bounty, of plant foods and the humble legume, of nuts and grains and the silent revolution of monounsaturated fats. The creatures of the sea, they too played their part, and the vine's fruit allowed its modest indulgence. Gone were the heavier fare of flesh and the burden of saturated fat.\n\nIn the annals of study past, there was murmurings of this diet's power, of lives extended and hearts spared. Yet, the specter of stroke, of its sudden silence, had remained unexamined, a shadow in the corner of their knowing.\n\nAnd so they followed them, these women of healing hands and watchful eyes, through the seasons of life, from the vigor of youth to the autumn of their years. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred eighty-six souls, bound by their calling, their lives a tapestry of data and insight. They spoke of their meals, of their choices, in the language of questionnaires, their words distilled into a score that spoke of adherence.\n\nYear after year, the numbers were gathered, scrutinized, validated against the truth of hospital records and the finality of death's certificate. Stories of heart's failure and the silent stroke were corroborated, some left in the realm of the probable, yet included in the tale. Their habits, their weights, the air they drew into their lungs, all these were woven into the narrative.\n\nThe numbers were more than mere numbers; they were the tale told by the data, a story of risk and adherence. A model was built, a construct of hazard and probability, a tool to divine the future from the past.\n\nAnd in the end, the pattern was revealed. Those who walked closest to the Mediterranean way, those whose scores were high, found themselves less touched by the specter of heart's malady and the silent stroke. Over the span of two decades, the numbers spoke. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three strokes struck, and all toll, one thousand seventy-seven souls were claimed by cardiovascular fate. Yet those who embraced the diet, who stood in the highest quintile, knew a lesser risk, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the power of what they chose to consume.\n\nIn this study lay a truth, quiet and persistent, a whisper of hope carried on the winds of knowledge and the promise of a path less traveled.",
            "In the streets of a city far from home stands a figure solitary and defiant. The sign she holds bears a message scrawled in black, stark and unsettling, for it speaks of evil still breathing in the world. Burma, they call it, a land under the shadow of tyranny, where power was seized and held with an iron fist since the year of 1962. The monks in their robes of saffron rose against it, their protests a cry for justice that echoed in the streets and beyond. Yet the world turned, and the military with it, into a force of ruin and rage. Monasteries fell to their wrath, and the streets ran with fear and blood. The tales of those days tell of a Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, whose life was taken on a September day in 2007, in a moment that marked the cost of truth. The numbers they speak of are but shadows of the truth, for those who fled speak of thousands lost to the silence of graves unmarked and unseen.\n\nSuch is the way of the world, where power seeks to silence all that defies it. In the histories of man are the echoes of empires long fallen, where rulers claimed divine right over the souls of men. In lands far east, the rulers wore the guise of gods themselves, leading their people with promises woven through steel and tradition. In the land of the free, they say, a man of power confers with the voices of the blind, guiding his hand in the affairs of the many.\n\nThe stories of resistance are many, and they are written in the blood of those who stood against the tide. In a square named Tiananmen, they gathered, the youth and the brave, to speak against the chains of rule, and the numbers of their loss are whispered in corridors of power as the truth lies buried beneath the weight of silence. Across the world, in Rwanda, the land was stained with the blood of its own, as neighbor turned upon neighbor, and the earth drank deep from the well of human hatred. Farther still, in the lands darkened by the shadow of a Reich, the cries of the innocent were silenced in the fires of madness, as the world watched and wept.\n\nThese are the tales of our time, the stories that shape the days upon which we walk, and they are written in the names of those who stood and those who fell.",
            "In the annals of jazz, where the echoes of brass and reed hold sway over the shadows of time, Duke Ellington's legacy looms large and enduring. His life stretched long over the keys of the piano and the stands of the orchestra, and his creative spirit shaped the music that rose like smoke from the fires he kindled in the hearts of his players. Ellington's hands on the piano were like whispers, subtle in their presence, yet as a composer, he sculpted pieces of such depth and complexity that they became monuments to the talents of his band. He laid down the paths over which soloists could wander free, and he wrote with precision, calling forth the voices of his musicians to give breath to the music's ideas. In this, he found the tone of the orchestra, a voice unified and original, each piece a testament to his mastery of sound and the interplay of parts within the whole. In the history of jazz, his works stand among the most innovative and brilliant, like constellations in a vast, dark sky.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of knowledge on the sounds of Ellington, speaks of Creole Love Call, where he took the human voice and made it an instrument of jazz, a thread in the tapestry of sound. It was here, early in his journey, he wove voice into the fabric of music, adding texture and hue unburdened by words. This piece, Creole Love Call, stands as a testament to his gift for complementing the style of his soloists, a gift that would shine through the years. The slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dance of call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins soft and smooth, then grows rougher as it fades.\n\nChorus 2: The muted trumpet takes its turn, expanding the melody and lingering on the blue notes, like shadows stretching in the dusk.\n\nChorus 3: A clarinet rises, high and sweeping, with a piano whispering beneath in syncopated rhythm.\n\nChorus 4: The full band takes up the call, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds speaking in turn.\n\nChorus 5: The peak of the piece, as reeds now lead the call, high and clear, with the brass and rhythm sections marking time in syncopated stops.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, the voice and reeds in call and response, the voice now growling, a beast of sound.\n\nTag: A brief closure, a vocal run and a trombone’s dissonant finale.\n\nEllington’s use of voice as a brush to paint the music's colors is a trait that marks his work throughout.\n\nIn the year that followed, with Hot and Bothered, Ellington wove tight orchestration with his ear for the colors of sound. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, where the trumpet spoke in vocal tones and the voice sang with the spirit of instruments, blending into a rich tapestry. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) pushed these ideas further, as Ellington called upon Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on his muted trombone, a sound that carried the weight of the world.",
            "In the quiet halls of time, where nature's hand shapes the world unseen, the question lingers like smoke on the horizon: why do creatures change their form as they do? What binds or frees them on this path of transformation? D'Arcy Thompson in the year of our Lord 1917 spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the hope to capture life's simplest forms in the cold precision of mathematics. And though years have passed, much remains the same. The minds of men have turned to numbers and models, tracing the lineage of mollusks and their shells, those ancient homes and armors, through the ages of their becoming.\n\nIn our study, we reach out into the dark, seeking the patterns of change in Prunum, that humble dweller of the sea, melding the abstract with the experimental. We use the light that pierces bone and shell alike, the X-ray's eye, to carve out the secrets held within. In these images, we find the whispers of form, the hard lines of geometry in nature's hand. We take these lines and feed them into CerioShell, a device of stone and code, to conjure shapes that might have been, could be, or never were. We seek the borders of what can be, and what cannot, in the world of shells.\n\nConsider the shell, a spiral path through the void, a helix cast in calcium and time. Each turn, each whorl, winds about an unseen axis, the columella, the spine of this small universe. The whorls grow as they will, each with its own pace, separated by the fine line of the suture. The last is the greatest, the body whorl, and the spire rises above it, all its kin save the last. At the peak, the apex, and at the other end, the base. The creature within reaches out through the aperture, a portal to the world beyond.\n\nTo see the shell, one must turn it in the mind's eye, view it from above, below, and every angle it permits. The apertural gaze is the common one, the opening toward you, the peak above. Whorls are counted from the first suture, the shell split by a line, and the count moves in fractions, a quarter of a whorl here and there.\n\nA shell, a journey through time, marked by the apertures' path, a record of the life it shields. One can map this path, plot the coordinates of each whorl's opening, the radius that defines its reach. And with this map, this formula of life, one can alter the course, reshape the growth that nature ordained.\n\nIn this, we seek understanding, a glimpse into the hidden workings of the world, the dance of numbers and life entwined.",
            "In the shadowed archipelago of Indonesia, time has etched its slow passage upon the land, the cries of newborns and the silence that follows marking a decade's tale unchanged. The country strides toward some of its appointed destinies, the water and the cleansing of the land, yet the health of the young and those who bear them lags in its wake, a tale of unmet hopes and goals left to drift as they approach the year of reckoning, 2015. Such is the state of things as they stand, the reasons manifold, pointing to the need for a stronger foundation in the healing arts rather than the mere patchwork of programs.\n\nThe land has seen the hands of skilled healers at the birth of its children, a number reaching seventy-two parts of a hundred. Yet among these ranks walk traditional hands, midwives whose knowledge is deep yet cannot stem the tide when the blood flows too freely. Thus, the shadows of mothers lost to the hemorrhage remain unchanged, a testament to the work still to come. The healing of the young is likewise in decline, as fewer cases of the sickness of the gut in the young see the hands of healers. The records of care after the cries have quieted are sparse, yet the signs speak of concern, a low echo across the land.\n\nIn the realm of birthing by the knife, the numbers fall short of what they ought to be, a mere four in a hundred. This speaks of another shadow, the disparity between the city and the fields. In the crowded cities, the knife sees the light seven times out of a hundred, but in the rural quiet, only twice. The gulf of care stretches wide across the land, with the cities gathering the healers to their heart, leaving the fields to their own devices. And there is another divide, a chasm of wealth. The poorest and the richest stand twenty-seven steps apart in their seeking of care. The poor, burdened by the cost, find the way to healing barred.\n\nAs the land contemplates its course, the question looms, vast and echoing. How best to mend the wounds of service unmet? Should the land weave a tapestry of programs, each with its own thread, or should it forge a stronger whole, looking beyond the first cries and the silence that follows? The allure of programs is clear, with their narrow focus and swift returns. Yet there are shadows here as well. To favor one area is to starve another, the workers drawn like moths to the flame of resources. The tale of funds for one cause and the lack for another is an old one, told in the echoes of the past. And when many programs run their own course, the threads tangle, each unknowing of the other, and the weight of forms and papers grows heavy.\n\nThus the land stands at the crossroads, the path ahead shrouded in mist, waiting for the light to break the dawn.",
            "In the span of a century, the landscape of Popular Music has unfurled like an endless tapestry, its threads weaving into countless genres, each distinct yet interwoven. To speak their names is to attempt to capture the wind. Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each a tree in a vast and tangled forest, bearing branches of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that reach out to touch the very edges of musical imagination. Among these, the heavy metal rock stands as a formidable giant, both expressive and diverse, casting its shadow over the last four decades. It is a language of emotion, one that speaks in tones often shrouded in shadow. Its diversity lies in the freedom it grants, for soon after its birth, it shed its skin to reveal a multitude of faces, each a sub-genre, each a testament to its pliability, and so the lineage continues, branching and re-branching into the present day.\n\nWe find ourselves now at a crossroads in the heavy metal saga, a place where the paths are so many and so varied that to define heavy metal is to grasp at smoke. It has become a vessel for themes borrowed from other realms, yet its roots run deep in time and memory. To comprehend the metal music that thrums through the world today, one must first seek to understand the metal movement, a force unto itself, more than mere genre.\n\nMetal is a movement carved from the essence of darkness. It is a symphony of the extreme—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It eschews the primitive for the virtuosic; those who wield its power do so with skill honed and sharp. It is, as one might expect, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic tide of the mid-seventies swept many into realms untold, birthing records that seemed to echo from other worlds, the drugs a muse and a scapegoat both. It is a music that embraces the dark and the visceral, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that had long reigned. In its later incarnations, metal draws from the Romantic's dark well, its influence etched in lyrics that whisper of shadows and the void.\n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a song born of the Beatles' dalliance with their own darkness. It rides the tumultuous wave of highs and lows, perhaps the echo of substances unnamed. Regarded by some as a harbinger of heavy metal, it was the Beatles' retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into the heavier, darker side of sound. Thus, it found its place upon The White Album, a testament to a band's unyielding desire to prove their mettle against their peers.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man crafting dreams both in pigment and in his own heart. The Dream, wrought by his hand in 1910, is not merely the depiction of a woman, eyes wide with wonder at a fantastical realm within her slumber. It stands also as a mirror to Rousseau’s own aspirations. A painter yearning for the nod of approval, the embrace of kindred spirits, and the applause of those who reveled in art. Yet, he found himself torn, a man beset by a quandary as old as the stars. To walk the path laid by others, to echo their strokes and gain their acceptance, or to stride alone, unshackled, and carve his own trail in the wilderness of creation. The Dream, in its essence, is this struggle incarnate. \n\nTo understand this painting, one must first know the man behind it. Born on the twenty-first of May, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a merchant who tasted the sweet fruits of bourgeois life. No academies molded his hand; he labored instead as a humble gabelou, collecting tolls for the state until he reached his fortieth year. They called him douanier, though wrongly, for never was he a customs inspector. Life dealt him blows, harsh and unrelenting. His first wife, Clémence, passed from this world, leaving him a single daughter, Julia, amidst the sorrow of eight lost infants. In the wake of grief, Rousseau turned to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries who draped the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of the folk, with dreams and desires as common as any man’s.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that Rousseau’s longing for acceptance by the art world burned so fiercely within him. Untrained, he entered the fray of art late, surrounded by the luminaries of his time. His recognition came only as Matisse began to etch his name among the stars. In the telling of Jan Gordon, within the tome of Modern French Painters, Matisse and Rousseau stood as rivals not just in paint but in purpose. Where Matisse recoiled from the trite, Rousseau yearned to be conventional, to find his place among the esteemed halls of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet of contemplation, many a thinker has mused upon the tether that binds ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. I reckon there's a deep reason for this kinship, as Keats whispered in his “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” where he saw beauty and truth as kindred spirits, inseparable and sufficient unto themselves. Much of what we gather in our journey is gleaned through learning or the hard edge of experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we find within us an understanding of ethics and aesthetics, unbidden and untaught. They are more of a revealing than a dictating. In our search for the moral and the beautiful, we strive not to set rules but to grasp the why of it all—the why of a painting's allure or an action's righteousness.\n\nBut here lies the crux, the elusive heart of it. No critique of art nor discourse on morals can ever seize fully what is good or what is beautiful. When you stand before the mystery of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, all talk of foreground and contrast falls away, leaving only the ineffable truth that it is art, that it is good. When asked of one's favored work, often comes the mumble of “There's just something about it,” a prelude to the more tangled explication. I hold that art and morals cannot be entirely pinned down by their traits. As O'Connor put it, a tale says what no statement can. However minutely we dissect the layers of a story, a transcendence remains, just beyond reach. Ethics, too, bears this ethereal quality. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as unutterable, as transcendental. It is perhaps this very “something,” this elusive essence, that is the soul of art and morality, their most potent bond.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are thus entwined because they strike us deeply, at a level beyond words, a noumenal realm if you will, borrowing from Kant. They move us in ways felt but not fully spoken. This bond is strongest in literature, where the moral line is drawn clearer than in other arts, like music. Literature, with its stories steeped in life's own values, speaks to us because of the truths we uncover there, truths as entwined with life as they are with the written word.",
            "The Germany of today stands as a formidable entity, a land bound by its own culture that stretches from the shadowed foothills of the Alps in München to the distant Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture flows like a river from Köln upon the Rhine, coursing through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. In such a tapestry of history and tradition, it is no wonder that Germany's roots are a mingling of tribes and distant origins.\n\nIn the mists of antiquity lies Germania, cradle of the German people. The etymology of its name remains a mystery, a puzzle for scholars and historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe called the Tungrians, known in times past as Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, coined \"Germanus\" to describe tribes beyond his conquest, those who lay across the Rhine with intentions vague and oft mischievous. The Gauls themselves whispered this name, a mark to distinguish the conquered from the free. The origin eludes certainty; some say it harks to the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's call. In the earliest pages of his tales, Caesar writes, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others muse it may come from the spear, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish \"garim,\" to shout, for the Germans were loud and boisterous folk (Names of Germany).\n\nIn Tacitus' ancient hand, the tale of the Germans was penned in AD 98, a testament to their origin. He wrote, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who among the Romans would forsake Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans themselves, not in those early days. They sent their legions into the lands of Germania, seeking goods and the occasional conquest, yet they returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lingered at the Empire's edge, trading their harvests and their martial prowess, serving even within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the murk of Twelfth Night's tangled web, disguise serves as a tool, a mask to cloak the soul in layers of deceit, yet there lies a perilous edge. For in the shedding of that mask, one risks a solitude deeper than any night's dark. The choice stands stark: to preserve oneself or to salvage the fragile bonds with others. Deception's revelation can stir the hearts to neutrality or ignite a fire of affront, leaving the trickster stranded in a barren land of their own making.\n\nTurn then to the masquerade of gender, a riddle within a riddle. Why does one forsake their own skin for another's guise? Viola's plight is survival cloaked in necessity: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" cast adrift in foreign lands, her womanhood a vulnerability to be hidden under the mantle of manhood. Yet, this artifice carves a chasm between her and the women who might be her allies, leaving her adrift. And in her deception, Olivia's eyes mistake her for Sebastian, a love misaligned: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Compounded by the clandestine yearnings between her and Orsino, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nIn modern eyes, perhaps Twelfth Night unveils more than it conceals, the artifice prying open hearts to hidden truths. Olivia and Orsino, caught in the play of shadows, grapple with desires unspoken. Is Olivia's heart drawn to Cesario for the semblance of a man, or does it whisper a deeper truth? Yet, in this dance, Shakespeare's Olivia more likely mirrors the folly of those who love with eyes alone. Her heart turns from Cesario to Sebastian with ease, a fleeting infatuation replaced by kinship: \"A sister, you are she.\"\n\nThus, the play stands as a testament to the folly and the fear in the artifice of man, a mirror held to nature's own face, reflecting the shadows and the light that dwell within.",
            "In the chronicles of men and their deeds, the German colonial empire stands as a testament to varied endeavors and the shadow of its own making. In the land called German South West Africa, the echoes of brutality linger, a reaper's song carried upon the wind. The Ovaherero and Nama bore witness to the cruel hand of empire, a hand that knew no mercy. Yet to see the empire as a monolith would be to blind oneself to its complexities, for its reach was as diverse as the lands it claimed.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the soil of German East Africa, they found not savagery but a people versed in the written word, the fruits of German educational efforts laid bare before them. In places like Kamerun, praise was sung of the schools and the learning they nurtured. But in the harsh expanse of South West Africa, a different story was penned. Here the burden of educating the native fell not to the state but to the missionaries, and the support they received was meager, a shadow of what was given to the education of Europeans in that barren land.\n\nIn South West Africa, the schools that stood were for the Europeans, the state schools and the missionary schools alike, guided by a hand more generous than what the natives ever knew. And so it was that the majority of the native folk remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds left fallow and their tongues unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay deep in the soil of the land, rooted in the social and political winds that blew across it. This telling seeks to dig deep and uncover those roots, to understand the minds of the settlers and the colonial masters who held sway over the lives of the people.\n\nThe writings on German colonial rule are many, penned in the tongue of that faraway land, penned in a time when the empire still stood. These early accounts sought only to describe the schools, the methods, the means. Later studies, crafted in English, took up the mantle, drawing lines between the colonies, comparing, contrasting, seeking to understand. Among the most prominent of these is Cohen's work, a study of South West and East Africa, a tale of two colonies and the paths they trod. Cohen speaks of settlers and their influence, of how the white man's presence shaped the schools and the lives of those around them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of deserts and dry winds, yet with a climate that did not wholly drive the settlers away. By 1913, fifteen thousand white souls called it home, a number far greater than the next largest settler colony, East Africa, where just over five thousand made their lives. These numbers, these people, are part of the story, a story of education, of empire, and of those who lived in its shadow.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stand as testament to a rivalry that, like a slow-burning fire, smoldered through the years, igniting here and there from 1836 to 1893. The zenith of this conflict found its form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States cast its shadow upon Mexico, wresting from it Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new dominions. The tumult between these nations was not a thing of singularity, but rather a continuum of skirmishes that gradually withered before the dawn of the First World War. The genesis of this discord lay in the clashing souls of Americans and Mexicans, divided by the chasms of religion, culture, and the stark clash of their material desires.\n\nIn this, they were not unlike others, for nations clasped by borders often find themselves at odds, their interests rubbing raw against one another, spurring rivalries that span lifetimes. The United States and Mexico, their border a line of contention, mirrored the myriad rivalries of nations whose lands adjoin. As David M. Pletcher noted, only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States grapple with enduring diplomatic quandaries, while other Latin American nations wove more harmonious ties.\n\nReligion, that ancient wellspring of division, carved a rift between the United States and Mexico, echoing the struggles of countless nations before them. Sally Frahm observed that if the Americans of the twentieth century stood against fascism and communism, their forebears of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries waged their silent war against Catholicism and monarchy. This ideological struggle, akin to the Cold War's dance of shadows with the Soviet Union, was rooted not in governance but in the sacred preferences of these two peoples. The distrust was a legacy, passed down from the bygone days of English and Spanish enmity, a phantom that haunted the path to cordial relations between these two nations.\n\nIn their reckoning, Diehl and Goerts chronicled seventeen disputes that marked the 57-year saga, most of which were territorial squabbles, frontier quarrels that flared with border raids by bandits and outlaws. These incursions troubled the peace of American border towns, a scourge that lingered until both nations wielded their military might to bring order to their shared boundaries.\n\nAs the years unfurled, the rivalry's fervor began to wane. Schmitt elucidates that Mexico found itself tethered to the United States in a substantial manner, the tether being a shift in American ambition from mere territorial conquest to the economic overtures of the late 19th century, drawing the curtain on a rivalry that had shaped the fates of nations.",
            "Fifteen winters past, I found myself undone by an ailment that crept upon me unseen, unbidden, a shadow in the night. I was a nurse then, bound to the path not of dreams but of necessity, the certainties of work tethered to the frailty of flesh. \"You'll always find a place,\" they said. \"In sickness, there's always need.\" So it was I turned from the callings of the pen and the mysteries of the world to the care of the ailing, though my heart longed for other shores.\n\nI stood at the crossroads, forty-six years worn, unanchored, the coffers bare of treasure, and my hands empty of toil. My body, once a vessel of strength, now betrayed me. For fifteen years, I've clung to the lifeline of Social Security, living in the shadowlands of what once was, with naught to claim as mine. The struggle's an ever-present specter, an assault upon the fortress of self. Yet amidst the wreckage, one truth stands unyielding. Were it not for kin and the few steadfast souls who call me friend, I would have long since been adrift, strength sapped by the storm that is calamity.\n\nThe lesson is this: life is an unpredictable tempest, with storms both mighty and mundane. No fortress is impregnable, no preparation absolute. Some trials demand more than solitary endurance.\n\nIn this land of ours, there's talk of forsaking the decay of government largesse for the self's refuge. But I hold instead to the hope of rekindling trust among neighbors, of hands extended in aid rather than each soul retreating to their own solitary bastion.\n\nThe tale told by those who speak of rugged individualism is one of myth. Our forebears were not sustained by isolation but by the ties that bind, the compassion that bridges, the sharing of meager means. Those pioneers who carved paths through the Rockies did not do so on the strength of one alone.\n\nSo let preparedness be your ally. I have gathered my own provisions, the tools against disaster, the candles and the cans, the means to purify and shield. A plot of land to yield the earth's bounty is wisdom, as is the warmth of a wood stove in places where walls grant no solace.\n\nYet in preparing, look beyond the stockpile. Know the faces that dwell near, the names that echo through the hollow halls of your neighborhood. For in the end, it is the ties we forge that will light the way through the darkness.",
            "In the misted annals of time, perhaps in that shadowed stretch of years we name the fifth or sixth century before the common reckoning, there was born a prince. This child, in the years of his wandering and enlightenment, would be known to the world as the Buddha. He cast aside the trappings of the world, found a path through the fog of human suffering, and his words laid the stone for what would become Buddhism. And of this vast edifice, Theravada stands as the most ancient pillar. The faith, now aged some two and a half millennia, wears a different face than it did under the gaze of the Buddha himself. Witness, if you will, the island nation of Sri Lanka, where each year they perform the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and those who dwell in the lay world come together in this rite, a thing of sacred import, though never taught by the Buddha in his time. Such shifts have crept from the surface to the very blood of the faith, altering its essence. The Theravada sect, through the years, has bent and reshaped its creed, driven by forces of many kinds, both from within and without, both with malice and without.\n\nThere are notions we must understand to speak of these changes. The force that rises from within, born of those who walk the Buddha's path, whether monk or householder, is internal. That which comes from those beyond the pale of the faith is external. Hostility is any breath of wind that seeks to harm, driven by disdain for the teachings. Benignity, on the other hand, is a force without intent to harm or aid, though its touch may do either.\n\nWe must first turn our gaze to the heart of this belief—the truths that beat within Theravada Buddhism. A refuge they seek, these followers, in the triple gem: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma lives in the Tripitaka, the three baskets that hold the words of the faith. The Sutta Pitaka keeps the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the rules of life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Here lie the bones of thought: Anatta, the absence of soul; Dukkha, the suffering that threads through life; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. One must grasp these truths to escape the wheel of Sansara, that endless cycle of death and rebirth. In this liberation, one casts off desire, hatred, and delusion, reaching for enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law: the five precepts for the layman, simple yet binding—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, and do not drink of substances that cloud the mind. For the monks, there are rules beyond count. And at the very core, the four noble truths: life is suffering; desire is its root; suffering can be vanquished."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the shadowed corridors of negotiation, culture stands as a silent arbiter, its presence felt in the spaces between words and the pauses that punctuate a conversation. Culture, elusive, defined as much by absence as presence, is neither monolithic nor singular. To declare all Russians obstinate or all Japanese yielding is to paint with a brush too broad and too simple. The wise negotiator perceives the contours of a culture not as unyielding barriers but as landscapes to navigate, understanding the subtle shifts and undercurrents that might sway the discourse at hand.\n\nTo enter the realm of another's culture is to see through the lenses of one's own, to draw comparisons that come unbidden. The path to understanding winds through history and prejudice alike, and judgment finds no purchase here. One must accept the world as it is, negotiate within its bounds, especially when one's footing is unsure, when the ground is unfamiliar. On foreign soil, respect for what is sacred and enduring becomes a bridge over the gulf of difference, guiding the players towards common ground.\n\nCulture, like a river, does not cleave neatly along national banks. Within the walls of a company, a culture of its own takes root, shaped by the hours demanded, the clothes worn, the words spoken or unspoken. Corporate culture, too, has its rituals, its codes, its silent agreements. Across the American landscape, from one corporation to the next, from urban sprawl to suburban quiet, diversity of thought flourishes. Where some cultures present a smoother surface, seeming uniform to an outsider’s gaze, they invite a deeper delve into the hidden depths below.\n\nTo grasp the essence of a culture is to understand the values that animate it. If a culture prizes honor or the harmony of the collective, a negotiator will guard against shaming his kin in the pursuit of victory. In contrast, a culture that values the hard bargain will not rush to a swift settlement. These truths are the backdrop to the play of negotiation, a stage set before the first words are spoken. Yet, beyond the broad strokes of culture, it behooves the negotiator to seek the man behind the mask, to understand the person across the table, for therein lies the key to fruitful dialogue.",
            "In the dim chambers of thought where men ponder the divine, two voices rise, ancient and solemn. The first belongs to Anselm, who speaks of God as a certainty within the heart's confines. He whispers that the divine does not wander in the realms beyond but dwells within, a truth unshaken by the winds of doubt. God, he says, exists in our understanding, so deeply wrought that to think Him not is to tread a path of impossibility. Anselm beckons us to seek not beyond the shadowed walls of our own soul, for there lies the proof, untouched by the world's clamor. Faith, he names it, this knowing without seeing, this light in the dark where reason falters.\n\nYet there comes another voice, that of Aquinas, who walks not by faith alone but by the hard stones of reason. He bids us look to the world, to the change and causation that mark its passage, to the degrees of being and the harmony that binds it all. He lays before us five paths, each a thread to the divine, spun from the fabric of logic itself. In this tapestry, God is not a whisper of the heart but a necessity of the mind, a piece in the puzzle unseen yet undeniable. To Aquinas, the world itself cries out the existence of God, needing no leap of faith but only the clear gaze of reason.\n\nAnd so, these two stand, their voices mingling in the echoes of time. Each speaks of God, yet in their telling, the divine wears different garbs. One whispers of faith's quiet certainty, the other of reason's steadfast march. And we are left to ponder their words, to wonder if the truth of God lies within or without, or if perhaps it is woven from both, a mystery both seen and unseen.",
            "In the world of letters, there are many ways to cast a shadow or a light upon the themes that haunt a story. Some methods strike deeper than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, he crafts his tale with a deft hand, employing a tapestry of techniques to evoke a sense of feeling or mood. At times, Fitzgerald marries words in a way that would seem strange, an adjective clinging to a noun, painting a scene with an aura all its own. Other times, he breathes life into symbols, colors that pulse with meaning. Gold, green, the pallor of white and gray, the flush of red and pink—all take on a life in his story. In his tale, Fitzgerald shapes the essence of these colors, white and gray, red and pink, folding them into the narrative like a subtle reminder of something felt but not seen.\n\nThe hues of white and gray become a canvas for uniformity, white tinged with a sheen of class, gray with the weight of age. From the story’s first breath, these colors whisper their meaning. Daisy and Jordan move like specters in their white dresses (8)—white is the color of choice. Nick dons white flannels (41) for Gatsby’s revelry, Tom’s shirt is white when he meets Myrtle (36), and Catherine’s face is powdered a milky white (30). When Nick surveys Gatsby’s party, the garish splash of primary colors breaks the spell of white (40). Fitzgerald casts white and gray over the ordinary, the mundane: the “white chasms of lower New York” where Nick toils (56), the names at Gatsby’s fêtes reduced to “gray names” (61), Catherine’s home a mere slice in “a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28). Common folk and places wear these hues as if they were a uniform: the “white girlhood” of Jordan and Daisy (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” of the valley of ashes (23), the “Italian child” steeped in gray (26), the dog-seller an old gray man (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sown the seeds of meaning within these colors, he turns them upon the characters, signaling their insignificance or conformity. Daisy becomes a specter in her “white” roadster, a ghost of desire that Gatsby chases (74). She fades to the background, a uniform shade against which longing is thrown into relief. The “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash (115), all serve to remind the reader of her spectral form, a figure made of longing and loss.",
            "In the sunlit scape of San Diego County, where the land breathes mildness and the sky lingers in perpetual azure, the earth yields its bounty. Tomatoes and citrus, greens that stretch leafy and bright under the golden arc of day, squash and broccoli, herbs and trees laden with peaches and lemons. Berries and honey and the sharp warmth of peppers. A land where organic dreams find root and flourish, their promise whispered among the groves and fields. Here, the earth's pulse beats with the rhythm of organic toil, and the market waits, hungry and hopeful, for the fruits of this labor. Eggs and milk, the rich yield of nature's gentle hand, find their way to eager tables. Farms open their gates to those who seek the solace of the land, the quiet joy of watching birds flit through the trees, the peace of a path untrodden but by the wild. \n\nThis is a land that makes its claim not only upon the soil, but upon the heart, drawing those who wish to shape its bounty with their sweat and vision. Programs abound to aid those who would walk this path, who would see the land not just as a field to plow, but as a tapestry to weave with care. They seek to marry the ancient whisper of the earth with the new hope of profit and purpose. \n\nYet, the path is not easy. Organic farming demands of the farmer what the earth demands of the seed—patience, labor, the willingness to nurture without the easy crutch of chemical aid. The land takes its toll in time and effort, each weed and pest a challenge to be met with hands and heart. The cost is high, the losses sometimes heavy, and the small farm stands alone against the might of larger foes. But there is beauty in the struggle, a richness in the diversity that blooms where chemicals dare not tread. \n\nThis landscape, this 160-acre sprawl of chaparral and oak, grasslands that whisper of the Mediterranean, this is where the dream takes shape. It lies at the border of the Cleveland National Forest, a breath of wilderness in the East County Southern Foothills. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its shadow here, a guardian of over a hundred voices of the wild—plants and creatures, some teetering on the brink, others already lost to time's relentless march. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies and birds, all hold their fragile court here. \n\nOnce, this land knew the tread of Native American feet, the lowing of cattle, the steady ring of axes hewing wood. It was homestead and livelihood, a place where hands shaped the earth for survival. Now, it waits for new tales to be written in its soil. I sought out this land, this place of possibility, and through the lens of a real estate screen, I imagined what might be. I found a farm, organic and hopeful, nestled in the same land, a beacon for what might come to pass.",
            "In the world, there exists a bond between brothers that is as immutable as stone and as binding as the earth itself. Within this bond lies a tumult of emotions: love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, emotions that weave through their lives like the roots of ancient trees. Brothers, they know each other as no other soul could, seeing themselves reflected in the eyes of the other. It is in the moments of deepest despair that the true nature of this bond surfaces, revealing its face whether it be benevolent or malevolent. And in such revelations lies a steep cost. To truly grasp the emotions born of this fraternal link, one must face the consequences they drag in their wake. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not through the lens of others but as he truly is. It is in the actions they take and the aftermath of those actions where their true character lies. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers tread this path, exploring the tumultuous emotions that bind them. Through a landscape lush and vivid with life, they embark on a journey doomed from its inception. In the final act, bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride, leaving only one brother to walk away. The theme is drawn out through the stark characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their shared moments, seen through the narrator's eyes, communicating the complexity of feelings that envelop the protagonist's world, shaping his every deed.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a singular force: pride. From the outset, when he first ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their last ill-fated outing, pride festers within him. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart his worldly skills, like holding his breath and running and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. But such fantasies crumbled to dust in the face of Doodle’s frailty. Born with a heart as fragile as spun glass, it was a wonder he survived at all, and to partake in such vigorous pursuits was beyond the realm of possibility. For the young protagonist, with his head full of dreams, such a revelation was a crushing blow. In his anger, he even contemplated the unthinkable act of smothering the life from the small child beneath a pillow. What kind of child entertains the notion of infanticide? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle bestows upon him a simple smile. A gesture so small, yet it kindles a flame of hope within him. His conviction, it seems, was never as strong as he believed, for deep within, there lay a primordial affection for his brother.",
            "In the vast labyrinth of the human mind, a wonder stands cloaked in mystery. As the world spun on its axis and the days unfurled into years, the way we likened this intricate organ to the world around us shifted and turned. Once it was but a wax tablet, then a papyrus, then a tome, and finally a machine of silicon and wires. Yet in this journey of understanding, let us not be deceived by these metaphors, for they hold truths as fragile as a spider’s web.\n\nThe dance of perception begins with the world’s touch upon our senses. The caress of air, the warmth of light, the murmur of sound—they are transformed into whispers of electric currents. The brain, with its unknowable algorithms, spins this raw tapestry into a vision. Through the lens of bottom-up and top-down processes, we piece together the world. A simple black box upon a canvas of white becomes more than mere shapes and colors. It is seen and known, not as a void but as form.\n\nYet, amidst this torrent of sensation, a sentinel stands guard—attention. It chooses what to heed and what to cast aside. Though the earth and sky may teem with countless details, our mind, in its wisdom, discerns the essential from the inconsequential. Like a name called out in a bustling hall, some signals pierce through the noise.\n\nFor the mind to weave its wonders, it must hold fast to memory. From the fleeting to the eternal, it stores its treasures. Each word, each sight, is encoded, preserved in the lattice of neurons or the dance of proteins. Memory lives in layers, ephemeral as a summer breeze or enduring as the mountains.\n\nIn seeking to understand this enigma, many have ventured forth with models and theories. Networks of meaning where thoughts are linked like stars in a constellation. A chair, a table, a wooden beam—all connected in the web of the mind, each node a beacon of understanding.\n\nAnd so, we journey on, into the depths of our own creation, seeking to know what cannot be fully known, to map the unchartable terrains of the human soul.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the throes of a merciless financial catastrophe. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market crumbled to dust, and titans of industry lay prostrate in the dirt, their foundations shaken to the core. The recession holds its grip even now, and thus we are compelled to question: what dark alchemy birthed this crisis, and how might we stave off its return? The tale is one of avarice and folly, of political machinations that drove banks and firms to cast sub-prime loans into a fragile and nascent financial edifice. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those monolithic entities, were not spared the pressure; they were driven to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into labyrinthine constructs of CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers faltered, as they were wont to do, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, and the ensuing chaos rippled through the repackaged mortgages, spilling forth into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the waning years of the Clinton era, in the year 1999. The President, his eyes set on a second term, sought to bolster his standing by loosening the chains of lending restrictions, thus sowing the seeds of the sub-prime crisis that would bloom seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a portentous tale in 1999: “Fannie Mae, the nation's mighty underwriter of home mortgages, has come under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to broaden the scope of mortgage loans among the lowly and the moderate, all the while feeling the weight of stockholders’ demands for continued profit growth.” Holmes’ words, like a prophet’s, foresaw the unraveling: “The government-subsidized corporation may find itself in peril should an economic storm gather, leading to a rescue reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.” And so it came to pass, as ill-fated lending practices laid waste to the economy.\n\nA multitude of forces conspired to cast the economy into a downward spiral, among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and the dread collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) wove themselves into the fabric of the housing market, entwining financial sectors with a perilous intimacy. The U.S. households, and indeed the financial markets at large, found themselves overextended, teetering on the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest tremor in pricing.\n\nAnd tremor it did. The housing bubble, engorged with false promise, finally burst, leaving financial institutions that had feasted on mortgage-backed securities to reckon with their hubris. The five great investment banks of the U.S. stood burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for a staggering 30 percent of the nation's GDP. The reckoning was swift and unforgiving: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were driven to seek refuge as commercial banks, their wings clipped by regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in $5 trillion of mortgage debt, were finally seized by the government’s hand in September of 2008.",
            "In the telling of tales there comes a moment when the writer stands poised at the precipice of creation, wings unfurled in the vast expanse of possibility. There, amidst the weaving of words, lies the perilous ground of exposition. A place where the unwary scribe may fall prey to the siren call of verbosity, drowning their readers in a deluge of facts and figures until the story itself is lost in a fog of needless detail.\n\nBeware, for exposition is a treacherous guide.\n\nThe wise among you have learned the lesson well: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even the most learned can falter, their pages heavy with the weight of words that neither move nor breathe. For exposition is a sly deceiver, whispering that the road to understanding is paved with the stones of history, that the past must be laid bare before the tale can take flight. But heed not its counsel, for therein lies the path to stagnation.\n\nConsider the tale of a woman and her love. Told in sparse lines, they met beneath a wide and open sky, were wed in grand celebration, and in one cruel stroke, he was taken from her. Such is the skeleton of the story, stark and bare. But to breathe life into these bones, one must attend to the heart of the matter, to the words unspoken and the moments shared. It is not enough to know they loved; we must see it in their eyes, hear it in their voices, feel it in the quiet spaces between.\n\nIn the weaving of their tale, the writer must draw the reader into the circle of their lives, binding them with threads of empathy and understanding. To know the man not by the fact of his existence, but by the warmth of his smile and the strength of his embrace. To see the woman through his eyes, and in her grief, find echoes of our own. Only then can the story take root, growing beyond the page into a living, breathing thing.\n\nSo, as you set forth upon your own journey, take heed. Do not rush to fill the silence with noise. Let the story unfold in its own time, each moment a step upon the path to revelation. For in the quiet spaces, in the pauses between words, lies the true heart of the tale. And it is there that the magic happens, when the story becomes not just a telling, but a living memory, etched upon the soul.",
            "In the early light of a day born of discord, I watched the flickering screen cast its shadows across the room, the voice from Columbus, Ohio, speaking of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had turned the dark of night darker still with a knife’s cruel edge. Ashley, Ohio bore witness to his hand, and they showed his face, a visage of unrepentant malevolence. They spared but a breath on him, the tale still unfurling like some poisonous vine around the morning hour, the scant details of a life cut and an arrest made.\n\nThe story shifted to another place, another soul, Travis Buyers, eighteen, left on the brink in Sharon Woods where the sun rose slow and heavy. No arrests, no faces to put to his pain. The SWAT team prowled the shadowed streets, and yet the story was brief, too brief, and I thought of how the world moves quick past the darkened skin of a man, the tales of their suffering muted in the din. The world watches when the fair-skinned fall, their stories a cacophony, but for others, silence.\n\nThere was talk of a Med-Flight helicopter, a bullet ripping the air, a .22 caliber that marked its passage through metal and sky. They offered five thousand dollars for the name of the one who pulled the trigger, a bounty on shadows.\n\nThe sky brooded over the weekend, rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties. A fleeting mention, a lure to keep eyes on the screen, the weather yet another player in the day’s unfolding drama.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, the Clime Road UDF in Columbus, a man cloaked in black skin and a hoodie. They lingered on his hue, the darkness of him, as if it were the crime itself. Six feet tall, one hundred fifty pounds, a specter in the night.\n\nAnd then there was Rene Rodriguez, a kingpin from Texas, his empire crumbled by the law. Marijuana, they said, flowing from the south to Ohio, a river of green. Twenty-five years he would serve, they said, but called it three hundred months, as if the weight of years bore more heavily in numbers. Hispanic, they named him, though what the color of his skin had to do with the tale, I could not say.\n\nThe stories spun together, a tapestry of darkness and light, the screen a window to a world as distant as it was near.",
            "In the world of markets and trades, there exists a creature known as the ETF, an exchange traded fund. It is not unlike a ghostly shadow of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, mirroring their movements but with a grace of its own, dancing on the exchange floor as freely as any stock. The ETF carries within it the promise of diversification, the spread of risk across many, yet allows you the singular command of a lone stock. You can sell it short, buy on margin, own but a single share if you wish. And in this, it offers allure. Its expenses are but whispers compared to the clamor of mutual funds. Yet, every rose has its thorn, and here you must pay a commission each time you trade it, as you would with any stock. A cornucopia of choices lies before you, as varied as the stars, yet the wise must always question. Do these benefits, these promises of diversification, truly hold? And to what extent? \n\nOur gaze turns now to the ETF known as IHF, and we shall weigh it against the ten pillars that form its foundation. We seek to know if in owning this single entity, one might touch the same heights as holding a varied portfolio of ten stocks. Or perhaps, by rearranging these same stones, we might fashion a structure with greater strength or return. \n\nTo unravel this, we focus only on the chief ten holdings, which together form 63.58% of the ETF's entirety. Here, we present these ten, their presence marked in the landscape of assets.\n\nTo understand how these ten stand for the whole of IHF, we take their current standing, normalize it to a full hundred, and thus calculate each one's offering to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were they to stand alone in the proportions dictated by the ETF's design. These numbers, these calculations of Beta and return, are laid bare below.\n\nFrom this tableau, it becomes clear. A portfolio of these ten alone promises a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a leap of 16%. The Beta too, sits lower by .12 than that of the ETF entire. It seems then, a portfolio of these ten might offer more bounty with less risk. Yet, we must ponder if the means of these two, ETF and Ten, are truly different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern this, we turn to the deviations, the measure of each of the ten's wanderings from the path, and normalize these too to a hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF itself.",
            "In the third month, the numbers fell away like autumn leaves, and when one looked to the figure, there it was, plain as day. A drop precipitous and unbidden, and hard to reckon why. When winter settles upon New England, the cold turns folk away from their bicycles and their boots, and maybe that accounts for some of it. December, a season when the fall semester winds to its end, and minds are burdened with the weight of schoolwork and grades and the myriad tasks that fill the days. Perhaps those commuter logs slipped away into the shadows of forgetfulness. Then comes the holiday, a busy time, and with it a long respite from the halls of learning, a time when students and professors alike find no need to tread upon the campus grounds. When January comes, the classes resume, and therein perhaps lies a hint to the scarcity of logs for that month. Yet February remains a mystery, its numbers low, unexplained. Perhaps, as with all projects, there is a fervor at the beginning, an energy that wanes with time. To counter this, we fashioned a Carpool Challenge Week, a surge in March to stir the embers anew, and it bore fruit, the logs rising once more. And so it was that we found ourselves grappling with the ebb and flow of engagement, the natural decline, and the breaks that punctuate the academic calendar.  \nAnother trial was the lure of the open road, the freedom and ease that come with one's own vehicle, a love woven into the very fabric of our being. Incentives were needed, and so we offered them, prizes aplenty, gift certificates to local haunts and distant chains alike. Yet one wonders how the stakes might change with grander offerings—a fine bicycle, a gleaming hybrid, an electric steed. Would such temptations have staved off the lull we faced? The prizes remained constant, but had they grown in worth as the months wore on, there might have been a difference. Gift cards served us well at the start, but had we announced new prizes in December—a bicycle or two, and then in January, the promise of a car—one can only ponder if the tide might have turned, if the logs might have swelled instead of dwindling.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I came upon the dusty scrolls of early Edison films, each frame a whisper from an era long past. Among these, a peculiar breed caught my eye, the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These were crafted with an alchemist's hand, employing the sorcery of the cut to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My journey through these flickering ghosts was one of charting the language of trickery, noting those few that strayed from the fold as the years waned. At the heart of these films lay a steadfast adherence to a world framed by the proscenium, static and unyielding, where each film was but a single breath, a solitary shot.\n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, confined within its painted borders, the camera an unwavering sentinel, fixed as fate. It was a tableau drawn from the theater, from vaudeville, from the dusty boards where magicians plied their craft. The actors moved as if bound to the earth, side to side, never daring to approach the lens that captured their antics. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) stands as a testament, its players entering from the right, traversing the horizontal as if the world itself were but a narrow strip. Even when they vanished beyond the frame's edge, the camera held its ground, unmoving.\n\nThese films were composed in long shots, the rare medium shot a whisper of intimacy never fully realized. The close-up was an unknown land, unexplored, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville left the audience at a distance, observing the whole of the stage at once. The actors remained in the middle ground, the camera a distant observer, never inviting a closer gaze.\n\nMost trick films found their life in a singular concept, a lone shot that defined the whole. Their brevity was as a breath held, seldom more than a minute in length, each frame a flicker of vaudevillian spectacle—magic acts, vanishing illusions, transformations—bereft of narrative weight. Yet, within these films, a shot to the viewer's eye was not always as it seemed. The illusion demanded a deft hand, stitching together fragments of reality to conjure the impossible. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) serves as a cunning example, the moment of her doomed head's severance buried within the cut, a single shot to the untrained eye, yet a patchwork of frames beneath the surface.",
            "In the shadows of literature's past, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction, an \"Old-New\" conundrum as Ian Watt might have it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic form has wandered through the halls of critique, derided and praised, its depths questioned, yet its 'terrible sublime' nature extolled (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto gave birth to this genre, melding the ancient with the modern, forging a new path in the wilderness of words. Walpole drew from the old stage with its dramatic echoes and the new mimicry of nature found in the 'modern' novels to weave what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This Gothic tale hearkens back to the medieval echoes of theatre, architecture, traditions. Even in the twilight of Otranto's release, \"gothic\" was a term cast upon many peoples, styles, epochs. Seen as old, unsophisticated against the bright mirror of \"modern\" progress, it clung to its theatrical roots even as it embraced the novel's new form, allowing the reader to peer into the souls of its characters. Thus, Gothic endured, timeless yet obsolete, new to the eyes of readers lost in the web of time.\n\nWithin these Gothic tomes, the notion of Chivalry looms large. This medieval path of the knight, both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, for Gothic writers, stood as a beacon of what was once noble and brave and capable, a reflection of what they deemed absent in their world. The chivalric past, idealized, romanticized, whispers of the Gothic's future dance with Romanticism, striving to mold the present anew. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil, despaired for the days to come. Swathed in politics and shadowed by accusations, he perhaps pondered, if not openly, the loss of inherent morality, the 'goodness' of the Gothic age, now vanished in the hearts of his contemporaries. This struggle breathes through his characters, as seen in Frederic. Before Frederic steps into the light, the reader senses his chivalric aura; a prince, wounded by life, touched by tragedy, presumed lost to the infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" his image swells with exaggeration, heralding the Gothic excess yet to come (66).",
            "In the vast sprawl of commerce where the world drags its goods from one end of the earth to the other, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. This stream of processes, born from the mind of Keith Oliver in the year 1982, moves like a river that knows no rest, carrying the burdens of order from the moment a customer desires to the raw pulse of materials, through the labor of hands and machines, to the place where the goods find their peace in the hands of those who want them. There are six stone pillars upon which this edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of those who guide the chain, the managers who bend the will of the world to offer service to those who ask it.\n\nProduction begins the tale, the first note in a symphony. It is the foundation upon which all else rests, the moment when the thoughts of what, when, where, and how take shape. It demands a keen eye on the market, the silent whisper of the people's desires, a guide in the wilderness. Here, decisions are made, the future drawn up in numbers and plans, the where and the how taking form as managers ponder the place and the machinery, the rhythm of time and the wear of tools. It is a step heavy with import, each misstep a cost of time and fortune. In the world of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the design, the booklet, the process that guides every hand and every step, a map in the wilderness of commerce. It is this clarity that keeps the wheels turning, the confusion at bay.\n\nNext comes the matter of supply, the second stone in the chain. Here lie the strategic decisions, the core capabilities that define a place, the partnerships that grow like vines from decisions made. A company may split its soul, dividing the labor across many lands and hands, each with its own tools and talents. Here, the manager decides where to place the burden, which division or partner shall carry the weight. They may choose to let another carry the load, to outsource the work, and in this choice find speed, find flexibility, while holding the costs at bay.\n\nAnd so the chain winds on, a path through the wilds of commerce, each step a dance, each decision a note in the song of the world.",
            "In the grim tapestry of Victorian literature, where the minutiae of societal hierarchy often stand as the canvas, there exists a divergence in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, like strange constellations in the night sky, bear the mysteries and the grotesqueries that set them apart from their contemporaries, infusing their characters with the haunted depth of dreams and enigmas. Here, motivations and emotions are laid bare as if under the light of a spectral moon.\n\nIn Oliver’s world, there is no peace. Ideas swarm his mind like spectres, and he walks not in the company of the living but with the echoes of Sikes and Crackit, their voices a discordant symphony in his ears. Even as he speaks, it is not to the world around him but to the phantoms of his consciousness. A gunshot rings out, shattering the air, and he is swept away by an unseen force, a maelstrom of sound and chaos engulfing him. Through this tumult, a gnawing pain lurks, an ever-present torment that knows no respite. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels paint the landscape of mystery often with the brush of dreams or the dreamlike, each stroke differing in its intent and revelation. In Oliver Twist, these visions unveil the hidden corridors of Oliver's soul, the shadows of his anguish, and the dawning of his understanding of the world’s cruel truths. In the retelling of his shooting, Oliver is ensnared in a vivid reverie, seeking aid in a world that spins beyond his grasp. The passage underscores his impotence amidst the chaos that surrounds him, the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit a testament to the abyss in his spirit. He is borne away, numb to the touch of the unseen hand, experiencing anew the despair born not from the sting of pain but from the fear that clings to his bones. The specter of this event raises the question of whose will guides his fate, for it is not his own. The shooting becomes a mirror to his helplessness, a reflection of his inability to seize control even as death looms. There is a whisper of defeat in this narrative, as if Fagin's shadow has begun to claim him, thrusting him deeper into a chasm of despair, shackling his will to resist. Otherwise, one might presume he would have struggled for the sake of survival, if only to grasp at life’s fleeting promise.\n\nTime ebbs and flows, neither day nor night holding dominion. Time is a specter, gone as soon as it arrives, and night descends once more; a night that stretches endlessly in its oppressive silence, yet slips away in its brief, haunted hours.",
            "In the dimming years past, I found myself in the hushed corridors of an after-school program, a haven for children seeking solace in books and numbers. Among them was a boy, Adrian by name, caught in a struggle with the written word. He was a small thing, perhaps in his third or fourth year of schooling, and the letters danced before him like shadows on a wall, some clear as a bell, others lost in a haze. He was Latino, that much was true, yet his English was as flawless as the summer sky.\n\nWe battled on, Adrian and I, until the day his mother came. I was minding the stragglers left behind from a field trip when she walked through the door. Her tongue was Spanish, mine barely so, but we exchanged what we could in broken phrases. It struck me then, like a sudden thunderclap, that Adrian's foe was not the words but the alphabet itself. He was a boy adrift between two worlds, and I wondered if my revelation brought him any peace. I hope, in the quiet moments, that it did.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light on the silent barrier that is language in our schools, especially here in California. It is a barrier unseen, even to those who speak the tongue with ease. For Adrian, the cure was simple: tutoring in the letters and sounds of English. But for others, those whose voices are new to this land, the path is twisted and long. There is no single answer. The dual language system, immersion, tutors, ESL classes—none alone will mend this tear. It is in their weaving together that hope lies.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child, but for all. Studies whisper of its success, of children who rise above their peers. Fear hovers over this notion, fear that it is folly, a waste. But it is not so. If we embraced this as the way, rather than the exception, all children might flourish. How then do we proceed? Must every teacher wield two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot place by their side aides, tutors, call them what you will, who speak in two voices.",
            "From the time we are children, we are told of things vast and incomprehensible, whispers of something greater that looms just beyond the reach of our understanding. Some are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still others search within the confines of their own hearts for the answers. Many of us embrace the faiths handed down by those before us, while some cast them aside, denying anything beyond the orbit of their own solitary universe. We may cling to one set of beliefs only to shed them for another as we wander. Whatever path is chosen, the journey shapes us, guided by our own visions of the divine. We seek a beacon in the darkness, a light to lead us from the shadows into the day.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch of our house, the rain a relentless tide upon the tin roof above, cigarettes between our fingers. The gutters spilled their burden, drowning the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a stare that seemed to reach for something unseen, part quest, part memory. He had grown thinner, his clothes draping his frame like a forgotten memory. His hair, too, had waned, sparser than I recalled. He avoided my eyes, gazing into the rain as if it might offer answers. I felt the solitude of that moment, fear clinging to me as I realized I could not speak of how much I would miss him. Words would give weight to the reality we both wished to deny. I embraced him, drew my chair nearer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father departed this world in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased his pain, merely stretched his days beyond what the doctors foresaw. I pondered what value lay in such suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered in the solitude of night. I uttered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased to heed my voice long ago.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. So I did not. I could not bear to watch the life that gave me breath as it flickered out. I wanted to hold the memory of his living, not his dying. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin. I knew he would not want me as a witness to his end. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nAnd no one even called.",
            "In the early days of this great land, there was a man named John Taylor of Caroline, a soul deeply tethered to the soil, who spoke with fervor for the cause of Republicanism. Though his hands were calloused by the plow, his brief brush with the relentless winds of politics shaped him into a figure known for his steadfastness and his voice, ever rising in defense of the liberty of men and the governance that would allow it. His creed lay in the furrows of the earth, for it was the agrarian life he held above all, believing it to be the noblest of pursuits, and it was this belief that painted his views on the nature of sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the courts of law.\n\nTaylor held within him a vision of a land unshackled by the chains of history. He saw a nation where the absence of ancient traditions was not a void but a canvas to inscribe a new order, a self-governance that could stand as a beacon to the world. He spoke of the inalienable rights bestowed upon all men, each linked inexorably to the other, so that to deny one was to unravel the very tapestry of freedom. Such rights, he contended, must remain beyond the reach of any government’s grasp. He understood the world as a place where, in its most primal state, those with strength and cunning would thrive at the expense of the weak, but civilization, he argued, must not mirror this savage truth.\n\nIn his mind, Taylor saw the blueprint of an ideal society, one where the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both light and dark. He was unyielding in his belief in a morality cleaved in two. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he declared. A good government, he argued, was one that protected the sanctity of private property, nurtured the land, and held at bay the tides of unchecked capitalism. For even in a system led by those driven by greed and self-interest, a government founded on these good principles would stand just and true. Self-interest, he believed, drove all men, but it was only when this trait led to the exploitation of others that it took on the guise of evil. Thus, a vigilant government was needed to temper man's inherent wickedness and to guard against the insidious creep of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, called for a Constitution interpreted with the utmost rigor. He envisioned a Federal government hemmed in by the strict bounds of the written word, no more powers than those clearly penned by the founders. He knew well the cost of an expansive government, the shadow of despotism it cast. Yet he warned against a reading too simple, too literal, for without the spirit of the founders to guide it, such an interpretation could be twisted to serve dark ends. To Taylor, it was the Declaration of Independence that rang truest, a document that spoke of a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation, and in this he placed his faith.",
            "He stood gazing downwards, his mind a blank canvas, absorbing the view before him. With a practiced detachment he studied the scene, his thoughts moving in and out like shadows in the mind, leaving no trace. It seemed as though he had no thoughts to call his own, just a fluid experience of the sight before him.\n\nOnce, heeded the advice of an artist he knew, he bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He had wanted to draw since he was a child, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil's touch to the brain's dance with lines. In its pages, it spoke of framing the picture, a technique to capture the chaos of detail, like a bowl of fruit amidst kitchen clutter, into a simple tableau. \n\nBut now, as he stared at the bowl before him, he could not summon that artist's frame. Overwhelmed, he stood, filled with a sense of awe. Like Picasso's blue, Monet's greenery, or the Renaissance's rainbowed masters, if his vision had any claim to artistry, this was the genesis of his Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingers found their tool, muscles coiled and relaxed, shaping the intent of his mind into the world, crafting perhaps his life's most creative act. Water swirled, serene and clear, dissolving fragments into the void. Muscles tightened, jerked, spasmed, and his hand struck the handle again. The stubborn brown refuse clung to the porcelain, unmoving, like a slug.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set firm, tie tight around his throat, he frowned at the insolent mass left for the hapless cleaners of Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand moved to the wall for the roll of paper. It wrapped around his hand, forming a makeshift oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending low, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dim light of dawn, the roads stretch out like a silent promise, but too often they bear witness to the tragedy of youth. Young lives, untested and unready, find themselves at the wheel of death's chariot, a truth as stark as the asphalt beneath them. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, still forming, not yet sculpted to navigate the perils of the road. Inexperience, like a shadow, lingers in every turn and misstep, leading to the tolling bells of rolled vehicles and lives lost. \n\nWhen they gather, these young souls, in the company of their peers, the odds darken further. Common sense long departed, they ride together, unaware of the silent calculus that plays out with each mile. A study in California, that land of sun and shadow, reveals the grim correlation: the younger the passengers, the greater the likelihood of calamity.\n\nStates like California have tried to weave a tapestry of safety with provisional licenses, a patchwork of rules to limit the night wanderings and companionship on the road. Yet these are but bandages over a wound that runs deep. As a group, the youngest among us are ill-prepared for the weight of this responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts doubt even on the age of eighteen, suggesting the reckless thrill-seeking of youth is a fire not yet cooled.\n\nWe stand on the precipice of time, gazing into a future where the road will fill with the offspring of the Baby Boomers. By 2010, the highways will swarm with these nascent drivers, each car a potential harbinger of disaster. The legislation needed is clear, straightforward as the horizon line. Schools could still shape the minds of future drivers, but the age to take the wheel should be set no lower than eighteen. A provisional pass, a rite of passage before full freedom, would still be necessary, along with hours spent under the guiding eyes of an elder.\n\nFrom the breadth of this land, a uniform law could rise, a shield for the youth who walk the thin line between life and the unknown. This is no novel suggestion, but one borne of necessity, a call to protect those who do not yet know the value of their own lives.",
            "The paper at hand traverses the landscape of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, drawing a map across three distinct territories. First, an understanding of the disorder is conjured briefly upon the page. Thereafter, the means of diagnosis are laid bare, those telltale signs that signal its presence. In the end, the paper unfurls ways by which a teacher, stationed within the confines of a mainstream classroom, can lend their hand to a student shadowed by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, known too as Auditory Processing Disorder, speaks to the manner by which the central nervous system—those tangled webs of thought and perception—takes in the world of sound. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, back in the year of 2005, penned words that captured its essence: a disorder where the brain, in its silent complexity, struggles to grasp the sounds that come its way. Those afflicted hear as any other, their ears unimpeded, yet something in the brain’s labyrinthine corridors does not work as it ought—a failure to parse words from the din, to sieve conversation from the noise.\n\nThe earliest whisperings of what would come to be known as CAPD find their root in the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder bore the name of \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers then began to pick apart the threads of communication disorders in children. An Italian cohort, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, embarked upon this journey in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing, crafting a model to fathom the workings of the auditory system that resides in our depths. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled a fire for research on children beset by CAPD.\n\nThe disorder shows its face in myriad forms: a person may lose the sound's position in the world, struggle to discern one sound from another, fail to catch the patterns in the noise. They might not sense the shifts in speech, the undercurrents of sarcasm carried by a voice’s subtle change. A sound may be blotted out by what follows it, the sequence lost to them. They might find themselves adrift, unable to make sense of the sounds that reach them, to act upon the clues they hold. \n\nDiagnosis comes through the lens of systematic observation, the patient’s listening behavior and auditory function tested by those skilled in the art—be they audiologists, psychologists, or others versed in such measures. Tools and tests abound, yet none claim the throne of high success. The cause of the disorder remains elusive, a shadow without form. Tests often bombard the patient with a cacophony, asking them to pick through the noise for words, numbers, meaning. Some delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses that ripple back.",
            "In the quiet solitude of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, where the suffering of children echoes like a distant thunder in my heart. The Division of Family and Children Services calls to me, a siren song to mend the broken lives of the abused and the neglected, to offer solace to families teetering on the brink. Service, respect, an ethical compass—these are the lodestars I hold dear. A commitment to bind the frayed threads between souls and to seek within myself the growth necessary to remain steadfast and true in my calling. These values, though the lifeblood of the social worker, are the very marrow of my being.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, the urge to heal others has been a constant companion, though the form it would take was shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many fled from their demons, and others sought refuge in hollow comforts. Such scenes etched themselves upon my psyche, guiding me toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead lay cloaked in mist. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I paused, breathing in the summer air, wondering where it might lead me. On a languid day, a friend beckoned me to her home, where I found a boy of sixteen, eyes flickering with fear, seated uneasily on her couch. His tale unfolded—a life marred by the cruelty of those who should have been his guardians. The following day, he summoned the law to his parents' door. I drove there, determined to aid him if I could. Behind closed doors, I confided my concerns to the officers, my degree from Piedmont College lending weight to my words. They, in turn, sought my voice to speak with the boy’s parents, for the law's hands were bound. Their eyes darted nervously, weaving tales to cloak their son’s cries for help as mere manipulations, \"simple\" disputes they claimed. This encounter, stark in its clarity, turned my gaze firmly toward social work, to shepherd children lost amidst such \"simple\" familial storms.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the realm of social work, a beacon in the darkness. We, as a society, extol the individual, mourning those who fade into memory. Yet, this vaunted individuality often bows to the weight of ancient customs, a contradiction I cannot abide. I am a lone voice, resisting the shackles of conformity. High school and college saw my rebellion against the injustices of our world: my hair a riot of hues, my attire a canvas of my spirit, the piercings a testament to my defiance. I stood with GSBA, my voice rising against the scourge of racism and discrimination. Social justice is my creed, and I shall not waver in my stand against the injustices that mar our society's soul.",
            "In the stillness of the night where sleep forsakes the weary, we turn to the contemplation of the models that seek to explain this restless plight known as insomnia. There are the biological models, rooted in the flesh and the blood, the genes that sing and the neurons that speak in silence. And there are the sociocultural models, the invisible hand that shapes the soul, the race, the creed, the standing in a world that turns indifferent. This paper lays bare the dissection of these models, each piece of research unearthed as one would a relic from the dust, to better understand the tale they tell. Their revelations, the clarity and the void, are weighed with the care of a judge passing sentence.\n\nA sleep disorder is a shadow cast in many forms. It may stand alone, a primary affliction, or it may cling to the darkness of another mind's turmoil. It may arise from the body's betrayal or the poisons we take within. The Dyssomnias and the Parasomnias, these are the names we give to the specters of the night. Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and their kin, they walk the line between waking and oblivion. The nightmares, the terrors, the wandering in sleep, these are the echoes of the Parasomnias. For some, the disorder is a reflection of the mind's greater unrest, a mirror to an Axis I or II affliction. This review seeks to unravel insomnia, and by its light, cast a gaze upon the broader tapestry of sleep's disquiet in the context of the biological and the sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of the biological, the inheritance of sleep's misfortune lies in the marrow and the synapse. The neurons in the hypothalamus, bearers of orexin, hold dominion over the cycles of sleep and wake. In the silent study of mice, a truth is glimpsed: the GABAB receptors on these neurons are the gatekeepers of slumber. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, ushers in the quietude of sleep. But to silence it is to court anxiety's embrace and deny repose. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the night’s gentle embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). From this, we glean a whisper of understanding, that what holds true for mouse may hold true for man, that the genetic tapestry of our being weaves this tale. The absence or flaw in this receptor might cast one adrift in wakefulness, beyond the reach of medicine. The sociocultural shadow of this knowledge is that should the trait be passed down, it would alter the sleep of the inheritor, rippling through life’s pursuits, the mundane and the meaningful, a hindrance in the monotony of the everyday.",
            "He had come to know the sprawl of University Park, a place he had wandered for nigh on two and a half years, or four and a half semesters in the reckoning of the school’s calendar. For many, and he counted himself among them, the vastness of the campus was a thing to be reckoned with. His first year, they had put him in an East Halls dormitory, out on the eastern edge of the known world if one discounted the distant stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, he would set out on foot toward the heart of this academic wilderness, places like Willard building, where the learned gathered. It was a trek that could stretch to twenty-five minutes if the skies darkened, as they were wont to do in State College. An alum, not long gone from these halls, had spoken of days when East Halls stood solitary, separated from the university by fields of untamed land. But time and progress had filled that void with sports fields and edifices of brick and mortar—the new Creamery, the health services building, apartments rising like stones in a field. With growth came struggle, the challenge of moving from one place to another more pronounced. What then, was the remedy for such tribulation? On this campus, it was the bicycle. But wheels alone would not suffice. Riders were needed, and the paths must be paved for their passage.\n\nHe had spoken with a friend who had taken to cycling again after years adrift. The friend, in his newfound wisdom, had wondered why he had ever ceased. “Bikes are great,” he had said. “For a while, it seemed uncool, but it’s the only way to traverse this place.” The bicycle, he knew, was the most efficient means of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel a journey of thirty miles or more. Like many of his kind, he had taken residence off-campus, a journey from the center as far-flung as any dorm. The wisest choice he had made was to procure a bicycle. Each day, he made his way to Thomas building, a place twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but a mere five if he pressed hard upon the pedals. Yet, Pollock Road, the swiftest route to Thomas, was a path fraught with difficulty, bicycle or not. There were virtues in walking, but he found himself too burdened by the weight of time. Without his bicycle, he would have no choice but to trudge on foot. Such a walk to Thomas would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from his day. Over a week, that was more than two and a half hours. And when he considered all the other journeys he must make, to classes, to appointments, that was time he could not afford to lose.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the specter of technology and capitalism entwined, crafting a bleak tapestry where the individual is a mere whisper lost in the roar of the collective. Here, community reigns supreme, and from the cradle, souls are molded to chase fleeting pleasures, their gaze never lifting from the shallow trough of immediate gratification. They are pawns in a grander scheme, shackled to a singular doctrine by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's wary eye cast upon these burgeoning systems. His narrative drips with the lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—each word a stone in the edifice of his critique against the economic machine rising in his era.\n\nCapitalism stands lampooned under the Marxist banner of false consciousness, a shroud that blinds the populace to the true nature of their class tetherings, ensnaring them in self-interest. Ideological reins guide the proletariat, their strings pulled by those in power, a truth laid bare in the conditioned masses of Huxley's world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk wander without true will, their minds lulled by hypnopædia into a ceaseless cycle of consumption and indulgence. The World Controller orchestrates this facade, weaving hegemony's threads to bind social classes beneath an unyielding hierarchy, where the ignorant buy into a system that chains them. Even the Alphas and Betas, except for outliers like Bernard, slumber in complicity, their awareness a dormant ember.\n\nIn this barren land, relationships fall away like dust, the characters rendered as shadows, void of depth. Perhaps Huxley whispers that the confluence of technology and capitalism erodes the spirit, stripping man of will and voice. Love is a forgotten legend; emotions are muted shades, interactions mere surface ripples. Men speak of women in terms vacuous and crass, while women recount their liaisons with a brazen air. Each class, content in its station, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism, their unwavering loyalty a testament to Marxist visions of the proletariat, convinced of their supremacy as long as they tread the path of consumption, obedience, and conformity.\n\nThus, Huxley paints his cautionary tale, the ashes of individuality scattered by the winds of progress and profit.",
            "Four winters past in a classroom at CBC where I first took up the study of Islam, there were voices raised in fervent debate over the nature of its creed. Was it a faith marred by the stain of hostility? I reckon now that this question holds even more weight in the present day's light. The years since the towers fell have seen the great wheel of mass media spin from suspicion and fear to a curious acceptance of Islam within these American shores. Back then, it would have seemed unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, with his roots entwined in the Muslim world, to stand upon the threshold of the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad, as set down in the pages of his biography, caught my interest with its paradoxes. From what I had gathered, Muhammad was a man who wielded the sword to spread his faith, subjugating tribes and compelling them to embrace Islam. Yet, this biography paints him as a martyr misunderstood, a man of humility who drew followers not by force, but through the quiet power of his teachings. They came, one by one, seeking the light of what he spoke.\n\nAnd in those stories, one finds echoes of another. The ministry of Jesus, whose miracles are known to the world, and the acts ascribed to Muhammad bear a strange likeness. Such as when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, a reflection of the loaves and fishes. It seems the writers would have Muhammad seen as a prophet whose life was a testament to truth and wonder, not needing to prove what was plain. But this shadowing of Jesus' own miracles seems to me an unjust imitation, a borrowing that diminishes the marvels of Christ.\n\nThe tales of conversion in Muhammad's biography stand as testaments, or so they claim. Yet, they are tales told at a distance, passed from one to another like echoes in a canyon. I found myself distrustful of these accounts, for their circuitous origins seemed to weaken rather than strengthen their claims to truth.\n\nWhat sits uneasily with me is the portrayal of Muhammad as a figure of divine grace, gentle and wise beyond measure. For history, as I know it, paints a different picture, one that does not align with the gentleness ascribed to him. I wonder if those who follow him today see this history for what it is, or if they are content with the visage crafted by those who came after.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the voice of Jesus lingered, a whisper among the clamor of men who would shape it to their own ends. His words, once simple and clear, became tangled in the thoughts of those who followed. The path of Christianity veered away, like a river twisting from its source, until it bore scant resemblance to what it had been at its inception. Yet now, in the shadow of the world, there stirs an awareness—a slow awakening to the distance traveled from the origin. The world, in its ceaseless motion, moves towards progress. And yet there are those who cling to the past, their grip firm upon traditions handed down, unwilling to see beyond the veil of what they've known.\n\nAmong the faithful, there comes a yearning, a thirst for the truth as it was first poured. To peel away the layers of doctrine accrued over the centuries, like peeling bark from an ancient tree, to find the heartwood within. It is a journey that will not be swift. Decades, perhaps centuries, will pass before the tide turns fully. But the turning is inevitable, as sure as the sun will rise. The clock moves backward, unwinding the threads of history to reveal the tapestry as it was first woven.\n\nIn this great unraveling, there grows a movement—a return to the essence, the core of what Jesus, the man, sought to impart. As this wave sweeps across lands and seas, the church will stand steadfast, a beacon guiding those who seek. Yet as the theological clock rewinds, the myriad voices of Christendom will find harmony, the cacophony of belief yielding to a singular tune. Borders and divisions will fall away, leaving only unity in their wake. History is rich with reversals. Once, Christians were the hunted, the outcasts, scourged by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later don the mantle of their faith. Our own nation has turned from the chains of slavery to embrace leadership from those once bound.\n\nThis coming reversion will play out upon the stage of Christendom, a grand undoing in search of the source. Diversity, once celebrated, will give way to a singular truth. And this will be made possible by reading the words of Jesus not as ironclad edicts, but as metaphors, rich with meaning and open to interpretation.\n\nSo what, then, happened since the days when Jesus walked the earth? Cast your gaze far into the past, and you find Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted. Monotheism, the divine touch upon the world, and the Hebrew scriptures held sway when the Roman legions marched into Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But even then, the Jewish people were not of one mind. Divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each held their own vision of what should be. Yet from this crucible of belief, something new was forged.",
            "In the heart of the city where smoke rose like a dark river against the sky, there was a place where men worked themselves into the ground, driven by the greed of those above them. The air was thick with the stench of industry, a testament to the insatiable hunger of men who would grow their empires regardless of the cost. The Jungle laid bare this truth, a tale of ambition and disregard, where the mighty chimneys spewed their filth, heedless of the lives they choked beneath their shadows.\n\nThe factory owners, their eyes fixed on profit, cared little for the souls toiling in the bellies of their machines. Sinclair's words cut through the smoke, revealing a world where human worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. There was no room for loyalty, no place where decency might find a foothold. In this seething pit of jealousy and hatred, men were cast aside without thought, their labor spent and their lives discarded as easily as the refuse that lined the streets of Packingtown.\n\nIn those days, the law was silent, and the workers bore their burdens alone. The managers, unchecked, drove them harder, faster, into the maw of progress. The conditions were brutal, relentless, and the people who endured them were little more than slaves to a system that offered no escape. Even the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, turned against them, profiting from their plight.\n\nSinclair painted a world where survival teetered on the edge of starvation, where morality was as scarce as the warmth of the sun through the smoke. The men who held the reins were as ruthless as any slave driver, and under their rule, the city was a place of despair. In the eyes of the workers, there was no end, no respite, only the endless grind of a world that turned without care or compassion. And so they labored, caught in the web of their own making, bound to the whims of those who held their fate in callous hands.",
            "In the shadowlands of Edgar Allan Poe’s mind, there lay a poem he deemed among his finest—“Dream-Land.” Within its verses, the word “Thulé” emerges, twice invoked as if to bind the spectral narrative at its edges. Mabbott traces this term’s lineage back to Virgil, who spoke of Thulé as an island adrift at the world's edge, north of Britain, where the known world frayed into myth. Yet Virgil’s voice is not the only echo in Poe’s work. The Germanic allure, the whispering of Goethe’s pen, held sway over him.\n\nThis tether to Goethe is no mere shadow. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" threads a connection between their verses, positing that Poe wandered in the paths Goethe once trod. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, celebrant of the poetic drama “Faust,” which unfurled in two acts, the first in 1808, the last in the breath of Goethe’s own departure in 1832. Within Faust’s latter part, a poem named “The King of Thulé” resides—a tale of a king, whose queen’s parting gift, a goblet, became his anchor to memory and sorrow. He drank deeply from it, and when the weight of life pressed too heavily, he cast the goblet to the sea and followed it into the abyss.\n\nThe king’s lament, his isolation, and his descent into shadow echo the landscape of Poe’s “Dream-Land,” where the speaker wanders amid the ghosts of friends and a world devoid of hue. It is as if Poe stood at the edge of Goethe’s creation, a dark reflection of his own losses and the solace he found in drink. The resonance of Thulé also reached “The Pit and the Pendulum” less than a year before, marking Poe’s fascination with the term.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thulé straddles his oeuvre, a spectral thread linking “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “Dream-Land.” The two pieces breathe as companions, “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” entwined. Thulé, in Poe’s vision, is a realm of desolation, haunted, a vista of shadows much like the mournful king’s domain in Goethe’s dirge. Poe steps into Goethe’s lament, his own sorrows mirrored in the king’s fatal gesture.\n\nIn Goethe, Poe found a kinship, drawn not only by the pull of Tennyson’s name but by the very tide of reproductions that carried Goethe’s work across time and place, into Poe’s own hands. The German poet’s influence seeped into the fibers of Poe’s being, a spectral dialogue across the ages.",
            "In the state of California, the question arises whether a patron, finding herself sprawled upon the floor of a grocery store, having slipped upon an ungainly puddle of applesauce left untended, might claim punitive damages with the assertion that the store's overseer acted with malice. The tale unfolds thus: though twice informed of the treacherous mess, the manager, with indifference borne of hunger, delayed its removal for the sake of his supper.\n\nThe court, in its deliberation, would be hesitant to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense without due consideration. For the law demands evidence of a reckless and conscious disregard for the inevitable harm that such negligence might bring, conduct that courts must find despicable in its essence. Palmer, in her lament, shall argue that the manager, one Martin by name, ought to have foreseen the peril of leaving the spill uncleansed, for the annals of the store bore witness to numerous such misfortunes in the months preceding her own calamity. Yet, with such foreknowledge, Martin remained inert.\n\nThe charge of despicable conduct may seem less robust, yet Palmer’s case holds ground, given the history of six prior slip-and-fall mishaps within that fateful year of 2009, all under Martin’s watchful eye, and still, no measures did he take to secure the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn a day marked by the unlucky digits of October 13, in the year two thousand and nine, as the clock struck five in the evening, a missive was delivered by Rich Wayne, a loyal employee of D&D Markets, to his superior, Paul Martin. The message was clear: an applesauce spill sullied an aisle. But Martin, ensconced in his meal, dismissed it with a wave, claiming no time for such trifles. A quarter of an hour passed, and another messenger, Mary J. Haddigan, brought the same warning. Yet Martin, steadfast in his neglect, offered the same reply. At the half-hour's mark, Jennifer Palmer, unsuspecting, found her footing lost, and with it, her well-being, as she met the unforgiving ground, her back injured.\n\nThe annals of that year recorded five prior slip-and-fall encounters at the establishment known as D&D. Now, Palmer seeks reparations both compensatory and punitive for her trials, and the question put forth is whether to seek a partial dismissal of her claim for punitive damages.\n\nUnder the statutes of California, a grievance unmoored from contractual bounds may yield punitive damages if it is shown that the wrongdoer acted with oppression, fraud, or malice as defined by law. Malice, in this context, would be an act intended to cause harm, or if not by intent, then by despicable conduct carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The courts have seen fit to label as malicious those acts undertaken with such disregard, where the defendant was aware of the likely harm their actions might cause, yet chose, with deliberation, to ignore the perilous outcomes. Such is the precedent set in the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co.\n\nThus, the tale is set before the court, the outcome yet to be written in the annals of justice.",
            "She'd always felt it, that yearning, a need that would not be sated, a hunger that gnawed at the edges of her young soul. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the unruly world of adolescence. And now, three years on at seventeen, it lingered still, a shadow cast over her days. She'd come to reckon it was someone she sought, not something, and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They'd come, awkward and earnest, those boys, with their clumsy overtures, but none could breach the fortress of her indifference. She'd pondered this anomaly, puzzled over this disquiet that set her apart from other girls her age, but no answer came. Just theories, frail and unsatisfying, and so she moved through her life, questioning her desires in silence.\n\nHome was a sanctuary, a place of peace. Her parents were good folk, calm and even-tempered, their disagreements rare and fleeting like the last rays of sunlight. Their quarrels with her were rarer still, mostly confined to her own assertions of independence, her spirited rebellion against their gentle rule. She was their daughter, their bright and lively counterpoint, her vivacity a beacon that drew others to her, an easy charm that endeared her to many.\n\nBut today peace was a stranger. She wandered from room to room, seeking some new spark for her restless mind, when a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, her mother's voice like a bell tolling in the quiet. Panic rose in her, a swift tide, and she flew to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay there, crumpled on the floor, pain etched across her face as she gasped out \"Ow\" with each shallow breath. The girl knelt beside her, her hand gentle on her mother's arm, her voice steady. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came in a rush, strained and urgent, and the daughter could see the depths of her mother's suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" With her mother's guidance, she gathered her strength, grateful for the lessons that had taught her how to bear such a burden. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic smells and whispered fears, but these she did not notice, her mind fixed on her mother, her heart a drum in her chest. She bore the injured woman inside, her voice rising above the sterile clamor, summoning aid. Faces turned, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was brought, her mother lifted onto it, whisked away to where she could be cared for. And there the daughter sat, alone with her worry, the minutes stretching into hours.\n\nHer mother had fallen, toppled from a stool in her quest for a vase that rested beyond her reach, high up in the kitchen's tallest cupboard.",
            "In the quiet corridors of study and the echo of diligent footsteps, a journey took place, a search for truth amid the patterns of life and the whispers of mortality. The Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of ancient customs and sun-drenched lands, was laid bare in its essence. A score, an alternate Mediterranean score they called it, a quantification of the diet's embrace, a beacon against the shadow of chronic heart disease and the silent thief of stroke.\n\nThis score, this marker, was a reflection of the earth's bounty, of plant foods and the humble legume, of nuts and grains and the silent revolution of monounsaturated fats. The creatures of the sea, they too played their part, and the vine's fruit allowed its modest indulgence. Gone were the heavier fare of flesh and the burden of saturated fat.\n\nIn the annals of study past, there was murmurings of this diet's power, of lives extended and hearts spared. Yet, the specter of stroke, of its sudden silence, had remained unexamined, a shadow in the corner of their knowing.\n\nAnd so they followed them, these women of healing hands and watchful eyes, through the seasons of life, from the vigor of youth to the autumn of their years. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred eighty-six souls, bound by their calling, their lives a tapestry of data and insight. They spoke of their meals, of their choices, in the language of questionnaires, their words distilled into a score that spoke of adherence.\n\nYear after year, the numbers were gathered, scrutinized, validated against the truth of hospital records and the finality of death's certificate. Stories of heart's failure and the silent stroke were corroborated, some left in the realm of the probable, yet included in the tale. Their habits, their weights, the air they drew into their lungs, all these were woven into the narrative.\n\nThe numbers were more than mere numbers; they were the tale told by the data, a story of risk and adherence. A model was built, a construct of hazard and probability, a tool to divine the future from the past.\n\nAnd in the end, the pattern was revealed. Those who walked closest to the Mediterranean way, those whose scores were high, found themselves less touched by the specter of heart's malady and the silent stroke. Over the span of two decades, the numbers spoke. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three strokes struck, and all toll, one thousand seventy-seven souls were claimed by cardiovascular fate. Yet those who embraced the diet, who stood in the highest quintile, knew a lesser risk, a relative risk of 0.71, a testament to the power of what they chose to consume.\n\nIn this study lay a truth, quiet and persistent, a whisper of hope carried on the winds of knowledge and the promise of a path less traveled.",
            "In the streets of a city far from home stands a figure solitary and defiant. The sign she holds bears a message scrawled in black, stark and unsettling, for it speaks of evil still breathing in the world. Burma, they call it, a land under the shadow of tyranny, where power was seized and held with an iron fist since the year of 1962. The monks in their robes of saffron rose against it, their protests a cry for justice that echoed in the streets and beyond. Yet the world turned, and the military with it, into a force of ruin and rage. Monasteries fell to their wrath, and the streets ran with fear and blood. The tales of those days tell of a Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, whose life was taken on a September day in 2007, in a moment that marked the cost of truth. The numbers they speak of are but shadows of the truth, for those who fled speak of thousands lost to the silence of graves unmarked and unseen.\n\nSuch is the way of the world, where power seeks to silence all that defies it. In the histories of man are the echoes of empires long fallen, where rulers claimed divine right over the souls of men. In lands far east, the rulers wore the guise of gods themselves, leading their people with promises woven through steel and tradition. In the land of the free, they say, a man of power confers with the voices of the blind, guiding his hand in the affairs of the many.\n\nThe stories of resistance are many, and they are written in the blood of those who stood against the tide. In a square named Tiananmen, they gathered, the youth and the brave, to speak against the chains of rule, and the numbers of their loss are whispered in corridors of power as the truth lies buried beneath the weight of silence. Across the world, in Rwanda, the land was stained with the blood of its own, as neighbor turned upon neighbor, and the earth drank deep from the well of human hatred. Farther still, in the lands darkened by the shadow of a Reich, the cries of the innocent were silenced in the fires of madness, as the world watched and wept.\n\nThese are the tales of our time, the stories that shape the days upon which we walk, and they are written in the names of those who stood and those who fell.",
            "In the annals of jazz, where the echoes of brass and reed hold sway over the shadows of time, Duke Ellington's legacy looms large and enduring. His life stretched long over the keys of the piano and the stands of the orchestra, and his creative spirit shaped the music that rose like smoke from the fires he kindled in the hearts of his players. Ellington's hands on the piano were like whispers, subtle in their presence, yet as a composer, he sculpted pieces of such depth and complexity that they became monuments to the talents of his band. He laid down the paths over which soloists could wander free, and he wrote with precision, calling forth the voices of his musicians to give breath to the music's ideas. In this, he found the tone of the orchestra, a voice unified and original, each piece a testament to his mastery of sound and the interplay of parts within the whole. In the history of jazz, his works stand among the most innovative and brilliant, like constellations in a vast, dark sky.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of knowledge on the sounds of Ellington, speaks of Creole Love Call, where he took the human voice and made it an instrument of jazz, a thread in the tapestry of sound. It was here, early in his journey, he wove voice into the fabric of music, adding texture and hue unburdened by words. This piece, Creole Love Call, stands as a testament to his gift for complementing the style of his soloists, a gift that would shine through the years. The slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A dance of call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins soft and smooth, then grows rougher as it fades.\n\nChorus 2: The muted trumpet takes its turn, expanding the melody and lingering on the blue notes, like shadows stretching in the dusk.\n\nChorus 3: A clarinet rises, high and sweeping, with a piano whispering beneath in syncopated rhythm.\n\nChorus 4: The full band takes up the call, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds speaking in turn.\n\nChorus 5: The peak of the piece, as reeds now lead the call, high and clear, with the brass and rhythm sections marking time in syncopated stops.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, the voice and reeds in call and response, the voice now growling, a beast of sound.\n\nTag: A brief closure, a vocal run and a trombone’s dissonant finale.\n\nEllington’s use of voice as a brush to paint the music's colors is a trait that marks his work throughout.\n\nIn the year that followed, with Hot and Bothered, Ellington wove tight orchestration with his ear for the colors of sound. A call and response between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, where the trumpet spoke in vocal tones and the voice sang with the spirit of instruments, blending into a rich tapestry. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) pushed these ideas further, as Ellington called upon Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on his muted trombone, a sound that carried the weight of the world.",
            "In the quiet halls of time, where nature's hand shapes the world unseen, the question lingers like smoke on the horizon: why do creatures change their form as they do? What binds or frees them on this path of transformation? D'Arcy Thompson in the year of our Lord 1917 spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the hope to capture life's simplest forms in the cold precision of mathematics. And though years have passed, much remains the same. The minds of men have turned to numbers and models, tracing the lineage of mollusks and their shells, those ancient homes and armors, through the ages of their becoming.\n\nIn our study, we reach out into the dark, seeking the patterns of change in Prunum, that humble dweller of the sea, melding the abstract with the experimental. We use the light that pierces bone and shell alike, the X-ray's eye, to carve out the secrets held within. In these images, we find the whispers of form, the hard lines of geometry in nature's hand. We take these lines and feed them into CerioShell, a device of stone and code, to conjure shapes that might have been, could be, or never were. We seek the borders of what can be, and what cannot, in the world of shells.\n\nConsider the shell, a spiral path through the void, a helix cast in calcium and time. Each turn, each whorl, winds about an unseen axis, the columella, the spine of this small universe. The whorls grow as they will, each with its own pace, separated by the fine line of the suture. The last is the greatest, the body whorl, and the spire rises above it, all its kin save the last. At the peak, the apex, and at the other end, the base. The creature within reaches out through the aperture, a portal to the world beyond.\n\nTo see the shell, one must turn it in the mind's eye, view it from above, below, and every angle it permits. The apertural gaze is the common one, the opening toward you, the peak above. Whorls are counted from the first suture, the shell split by a line, and the count moves in fractions, a quarter of a whorl here and there.\n\nA shell, a journey through time, marked by the apertures' path, a record of the life it shields. One can map this path, plot the coordinates of each whorl's opening, the radius that defines its reach. And with this map, this formula of life, one can alter the course, reshape the growth that nature ordained.\n\nIn this, we seek understanding, a glimpse into the hidden workings of the world, the dance of numbers and life entwined.",
            "In the shadowed archipelago of Indonesia, time has etched its slow passage upon the land, the cries of newborns and the silence that follows marking a decade's tale unchanged. The country strides toward some of its appointed destinies, the water and the cleansing of the land, yet the health of the young and those who bear them lags in its wake, a tale of unmet hopes and goals left to drift as they approach the year of reckoning, 2015. Such is the state of things as they stand, the reasons manifold, pointing to the need for a stronger foundation in the healing arts rather than the mere patchwork of programs.\n\nThe land has seen the hands of skilled healers at the birth of its children, a number reaching seventy-two parts of a hundred. Yet among these ranks walk traditional hands, midwives whose knowledge is deep yet cannot stem the tide when the blood flows too freely. Thus, the shadows of mothers lost to the hemorrhage remain unchanged, a testament to the work still to come. The healing of the young is likewise in decline, as fewer cases of the sickness of the gut in the young see the hands of healers. The records of care after the cries have quieted are sparse, yet the signs speak of concern, a low echo across the land.\n\nIn the realm of birthing by the knife, the numbers fall short of what they ought to be, a mere four in a hundred. This speaks of another shadow, the disparity between the city and the fields. In the crowded cities, the knife sees the light seven times out of a hundred, but in the rural quiet, only twice. The gulf of care stretches wide across the land, with the cities gathering the healers to their heart, leaving the fields to their own devices. And there is another divide, a chasm of wealth. The poorest and the richest stand twenty-seven steps apart in their seeking of care. The poor, burdened by the cost, find the way to healing barred.\n\nAs the land contemplates its course, the question looms, vast and echoing. How best to mend the wounds of service unmet? Should the land weave a tapestry of programs, each with its own thread, or should it forge a stronger whole, looking beyond the first cries and the silence that follows? The allure of programs is clear, with their narrow focus and swift returns. Yet there are shadows here as well. To favor one area is to starve another, the workers drawn like moths to the flame of resources. The tale of funds for one cause and the lack for another is an old one, told in the echoes of the past. And when many programs run their own course, the threads tangle, each unknowing of the other, and the weight of forms and papers grows heavy.\n\nThus the land stands at the crossroads, the path ahead shrouded in mist, waiting for the light to break the dawn.",
            "In the span of a century, the landscape of Popular Music has unfurled like an endless tapestry, its threads weaving into countless genres, each distinct yet interwoven. To speak their names is to attempt to capture the wind. Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—each a tree in a vast and tangled forest, bearing branches of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that reach out to touch the very edges of musical imagination. Among these, the heavy metal rock stands as a formidable giant, both expressive and diverse, casting its shadow over the last four decades. It is a language of emotion, one that speaks in tones often shrouded in shadow. Its diversity lies in the freedom it grants, for soon after its birth, it shed its skin to reveal a multitude of faces, each a sub-genre, each a testament to its pliability, and so the lineage continues, branching and re-branching into the present day.\n\nWe find ourselves now at a crossroads in the heavy metal saga, a place where the paths are so many and so varied that to define heavy metal is to grasp at smoke. It has become a vessel for themes borrowed from other realms, yet its roots run deep in time and memory. To comprehend the metal music that thrums through the world today, one must first seek to understand the metal movement, a force unto itself, more than mere genre.\n\nMetal is a movement carved from the essence of darkness. It is a symphony of the extreme—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It eschews the primitive for the virtuosic; those who wield its power do so with skill honed and sharp. It is, as one might expect, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic tide of the mid-seventies swept many into realms untold, birthing records that seemed to echo from other worlds, the drugs a muse and a scapegoat both. It is a music that embraces the dark and the visceral, a stark contrast to the sunlit melodies that had long reigned. In its later incarnations, metal draws from the Romantic's dark well, its influence etched in lyrics that whisper of shadows and the void.\n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a song born of the Beatles' dalliance with their own darkness. It rides the tumultuous wave of highs and lows, perhaps the echo of substances unnamed. Regarded by some as a harbinger of heavy metal, it was the Beatles' retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into the heavier, darker side of sound. Thus, it found its place upon The White Album, a testament to a band's unyielding desire to prove their mettle against their peers.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists would cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man crafting dreams both in pigment and in his own heart. The Dream, wrought by his hand in 1910, is not merely the depiction of a woman, eyes wide with wonder at a fantastical realm within her slumber. It stands also as a mirror to Rousseau’s own aspirations. A painter yearning for the nod of approval, the embrace of kindred spirits, and the applause of those who reveled in art. Yet, he found himself torn, a man beset by a quandary as old as the stars. To walk the path laid by others, to echo their strokes and gain their acceptance, or to stride alone, unshackled, and carve his own trail in the wilderness of creation. The Dream, in its essence, is this struggle incarnate. \n\nTo understand this painting, one must first know the man behind it. Born on the twenty-first of May, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a merchant who tasted the sweet fruits of bourgeois life. No academies molded his hand; he labored instead as a humble gabelou, collecting tolls for the state until he reached his fortieth year. They called him douanier, though wrongly, for never was he a customs inspector. Life dealt him blows, harsh and unrelenting. His first wife, Clémence, passed from this world, leaving him a single daughter, Julia, amidst the sorrow of eight lost infants. In the wake of grief, Rousseau turned to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries who draped the peasant in romantic hues, Rousseau painted from the heart of the folk, with dreams and desires as common as any man’s.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that Rousseau’s longing for acceptance by the art world burned so fiercely within him. Untrained, he entered the fray of art late, surrounded by the luminaries of his time. His recognition came only as Matisse began to etch his name among the stars. In the telling of Jan Gordon, within the tome of Modern French Painters, Matisse and Rousseau stood as rivals not just in paint but in purpose. Where Matisse recoiled from the trite, Rousseau yearned to be conventional, to find his place among the esteemed halls of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet of contemplation, many a thinker has mused upon the tether that binds ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. I reckon there's a deep reason for this kinship, as Keats whispered in his “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” where he saw beauty and truth as kindred spirits, inseparable and sufficient unto themselves. Much of what we gather in our journey is gleaned through learning or the hard edge of experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we find within us an understanding of ethics and aesthetics, unbidden and untaught. They are more of a revealing than a dictating. In our search for the moral and the beautiful, we strive not to set rules but to grasp the why of it all—the why of a painting's allure or an action's righteousness.\n\nBut here lies the crux, the elusive heart of it. No critique of art nor discourse on morals can ever seize fully what is good or what is beautiful. When you stand before the mystery of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, all talk of foreground and contrast falls away, leaving only the ineffable truth that it is art, that it is good. When asked of one's favored work, often comes the mumble of “There's just something about it,” a prelude to the more tangled explication. I hold that art and morals cannot be entirely pinned down by their traits. As O'Connor put it, a tale says what no statement can. However minutely we dissect the layers of a story, a transcendence remains, just beyond reach. Ethics, too, bears this ethereal quality. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as unutterable, as transcendental. It is perhaps this very “something,” this elusive essence, that is the soul of art and morality, their most potent bond.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are thus entwined because they strike us deeply, at a level beyond words, a noumenal realm if you will, borrowing from Kant. They move us in ways felt but not fully spoken. This bond is strongest in literature, where the moral line is drawn clearer than in other arts, like music. Literature, with its stories steeped in life's own values, speaks to us because of the truths we uncover there, truths as entwined with life as they are with the written word.",
            "The Germany of today stands as a formidable entity, a land bound by its own culture that stretches from the shadowed foothills of the Alps in München to the distant Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture flows like a river from Köln upon the Rhine, coursing through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. In such a tapestry of history and tradition, it is no wonder that Germany's roots are a mingling of tribes and distant origins.\n\nIn the mists of antiquity lies Germania, cradle of the German people. The etymology of its name remains a mystery, a puzzle for scholars and historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe called the Tungrians, known in times past as Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, coined \"Germanus\" to describe tribes beyond his conquest, those who lay across the Rhine with intentions vague and oft mischievous. The Gauls themselves whispered this name, a mark to distinguish the conquered from the free. The origin eludes certainty; some say it harks to the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's call. In the earliest pages of his tales, Caesar writes, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others muse it may come from the spear, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish \"garim,\" to shout, for the Germans were loud and boisterous folk (Names of Germany).\n\nIn Tacitus' ancient hand, the tale of the Germans was penned in AD 98, a testament to their origin. He wrote, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who among the Romans would forsake Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans themselves, not in those early days. They sent their legions into the lands of Germania, seeking goods and the occasional conquest, yet they returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lingered at the Empire's edge, trading their harvests and their martial prowess, serving even within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the murk of Twelfth Night's tangled web, disguise serves as a tool, a mask to cloak the soul in layers of deceit, yet there lies a perilous edge. For in the shedding of that mask, one risks a solitude deeper than any night's dark. The choice stands stark: to preserve oneself or to salvage the fragile bonds with others. Deception's revelation can stir the hearts to neutrality or ignite a fire of affront, leaving the trickster stranded in a barren land of their own making.\n\nTurn then to the masquerade of gender, a riddle within a riddle. Why does one forsake their own skin for another's guise? Viola's plight is survival cloaked in necessity: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" cast adrift in foreign lands, her womanhood a vulnerability to be hidden under the mantle of manhood. Yet, this artifice carves a chasm between her and the women who might be her allies, leaving her adrift. And in her deception, Olivia's eyes mistake her for Sebastian, a love misaligned: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Compounded by the clandestine yearnings between her and Orsino, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nIn modern eyes, perhaps Twelfth Night unveils more than it conceals, the artifice prying open hearts to hidden truths. Olivia and Orsino, caught in the play of shadows, grapple with desires unspoken. Is Olivia's heart drawn to Cesario for the semblance of a man, or does it whisper a deeper truth? Yet, in this dance, Shakespeare's Olivia more likely mirrors the folly of those who love with eyes alone. Her heart turns from Cesario to Sebastian with ease, a fleeting infatuation replaced by kinship: \"A sister, you are she.\"\n\nThus, the play stands as a testament to the folly and the fear in the artifice of man, a mirror held to nature's own face, reflecting the shadows and the light that dwell within.",
            "In the chronicles of men and their deeds, the German colonial empire stands as a testament to varied endeavors and the shadow of its own making. In the land called German South West Africa, the echoes of brutality linger, a reaper's song carried upon the wind. The Ovaherero and Nama bore witness to the cruel hand of empire, a hand that knew no mercy. Yet to see the empire as a monolith would be to blind oneself to its complexities, for its reach was as diverse as the lands it claimed.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the soil of German East Africa, they found not savagery but a people versed in the written word, the fruits of German educational efforts laid bare before them. In places like Kamerun, praise was sung of the schools and the learning they nurtured. But in the harsh expanse of South West Africa, a different story was penned. Here the burden of educating the native fell not to the state but to the missionaries, and the support they received was meager, a shadow of what was given to the education of Europeans in that barren land.\n\nIn South West Africa, the schools that stood were for the Europeans, the state schools and the missionary schools alike, guided by a hand more generous than what the natives ever knew. And so it was that the majority of the native folk remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds left fallow and their tongues unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay deep in the soil of the land, rooted in the social and political winds that blew across it. This telling seeks to dig deep and uncover those roots, to understand the minds of the settlers and the colonial masters who held sway over the lives of the people.\n\nThe writings on German colonial rule are many, penned in the tongue of that faraway land, penned in a time when the empire still stood. These early accounts sought only to describe the schools, the methods, the means. Later studies, crafted in English, took up the mantle, drawing lines between the colonies, comparing, contrasting, seeking to understand. Among the most prominent of these is Cohen's work, a study of South West and East Africa, a tale of two colonies and the paths they trod. Cohen speaks of settlers and their influence, of how the white man's presence shaped the schools and the lives of those around them.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of deserts and dry winds, yet with a climate that did not wholly drive the settlers away. By 1913, fifteen thousand white souls called it home, a number far greater than the next largest settler colony, East Africa, where just over five thousand made their lives. These numbers, these people, are part of the story, a story of education, of empire, and of those who lived in its shadow.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stand as testament to a rivalry that, like a slow-burning fire, smoldered through the years, igniting here and there from 1836 to 1893. The zenith of this conflict found its form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States cast its shadow upon Mexico, wresting from it Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new dominions. The tumult between these nations was not a thing of singularity, but rather a continuum of skirmishes that gradually withered before the dawn of the First World War. The genesis of this discord lay in the clashing souls of Americans and Mexicans, divided by the chasms of religion, culture, and the stark clash of their material desires.\n\nIn this, they were not unlike others, for nations clasped by borders often find themselves at odds, their interests rubbing raw against one another, spurring rivalries that span lifetimes. The United States and Mexico, their border a line of contention, mirrored the myriad rivalries of nations whose lands adjoin. As David M. Pletcher noted, only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States grapple with enduring diplomatic quandaries, while other Latin American nations wove more harmonious ties.\n\nReligion, that ancient wellspring of division, carved a rift between the United States and Mexico, echoing the struggles of countless nations before them. Sally Frahm observed that if the Americans of the twentieth century stood against fascism and communism, their forebears of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries waged their silent war against Catholicism and monarchy. This ideological struggle, akin to the Cold War's dance of shadows with the Soviet Union, was rooted not in governance but in the sacred preferences of these two peoples. The distrust was a legacy, passed down from the bygone days of English and Spanish enmity, a phantom that haunted the path to cordial relations between these two nations.\n\nIn their reckoning, Diehl and Goerts chronicled seventeen disputes that marked the 57-year saga, most of which were territorial squabbles, frontier quarrels that flared with border raids by bandits and outlaws. These incursions troubled the peace of American border towns, a scourge that lingered until both nations wielded their military might to bring order to their shared boundaries.\n\nAs the years unfurled, the rivalry's fervor began to wane. Schmitt elucidates that Mexico found itself tethered to the United States in a substantial manner, the tether being a shift in American ambition from mere territorial conquest to the economic overtures of the late 19th century, drawing the curtain on a rivalry that had shaped the fates of nations.",
            "Fifteen winters past, I found myself undone by an ailment that crept upon me unseen, unbidden, a shadow in the night. I was a nurse then, bound to the path not of dreams but of necessity, the certainties of work tethered to the frailty of flesh. \"You'll always find a place,\" they said. \"In sickness, there's always need.\" So it was I turned from the callings of the pen and the mysteries of the world to the care of the ailing, though my heart longed for other shores.\n\nI stood at the crossroads, forty-six years worn, unanchored, the coffers bare of treasure, and my hands empty of toil. My body, once a vessel of strength, now betrayed me. For fifteen years, I've clung to the lifeline of Social Security, living in the shadowlands of what once was, with naught to claim as mine. The struggle's an ever-present specter, an assault upon the fortress of self. Yet amidst the wreckage, one truth stands unyielding. Were it not for kin and the few steadfast souls who call me friend, I would have long since been adrift, strength sapped by the storm that is calamity.\n\nThe lesson is this: life is an unpredictable tempest, with storms both mighty and mundane. No fortress is impregnable, no preparation absolute. Some trials demand more than solitary endurance.\n\nIn this land of ours, there's talk of forsaking the decay of government largesse for the self's refuge. But I hold instead to the hope of rekindling trust among neighbors, of hands extended in aid rather than each soul retreating to their own solitary bastion.\n\nThe tale told by those who speak of rugged individualism is one of myth. Our forebears were not sustained by isolation but by the ties that bind, the compassion that bridges, the sharing of meager means. Those pioneers who carved paths through the Rockies did not do so on the strength of one alone.\n\nSo let preparedness be your ally. I have gathered my own provisions, the tools against disaster, the candles and the cans, the means to purify and shield. A plot of land to yield the earth's bounty is wisdom, as is the warmth of a wood stove in places where walls grant no solace.\n\nYet in preparing, look beyond the stockpile. Know the faces that dwell near, the names that echo through the hollow halls of your neighborhood. For in the end, it is the ties we forge that will light the way through the darkness.",
            "In the misted annals of time, perhaps in that shadowed stretch of years we name the fifth or sixth century before the common reckoning, there was born a prince. This child, in the years of his wandering and enlightenment, would be known to the world as the Buddha. He cast aside the trappings of the world, found a path through the fog of human suffering, and his words laid the stone for what would become Buddhism. And of this vast edifice, Theravada stands as the most ancient pillar. The faith, now aged some two and a half millennia, wears a different face than it did under the gaze of the Buddha himself. Witness, if you will, the island nation of Sri Lanka, where each year they perform the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and those who dwell in the lay world come together in this rite, a thing of sacred import, though never taught by the Buddha in his time. Such shifts have crept from the surface to the very blood of the faith, altering its essence. The Theravada sect, through the years, has bent and reshaped its creed, driven by forces of many kinds, both from within and without, both with malice and without.\n\nThere are notions we must understand to speak of these changes. The force that rises from within, born of those who walk the Buddha's path, whether monk or householder, is internal. That which comes from those beyond the pale of the faith is external. Hostility is any breath of wind that seeks to harm, driven by disdain for the teachings. Benignity, on the other hand, is a force without intent to harm or aid, though its touch may do either.\n\nWe must first turn our gaze to the heart of this belief—the truths that beat within Theravada Buddhism. A refuge they seek, these followers, in the triple gem: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma lives in the Tripitaka, the three baskets that hold the words of the faith. The Sutta Pitaka keeps the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the rules of life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Here lie the bones of thought: Anatta, the absence of soul; Dukkha, the suffering that threads through life; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. One must grasp these truths to escape the wheel of Sansara, that endless cycle of death and rebirth. In this liberation, one casts off desire, hatred, and delusion, reaching for enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law: the five precepts for the layman, simple yet binding—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, and do not drink of substances that cloud the mind. For the monks, there are rules beyond count. And at the very core, the four noble truths: life is suffering; desire is its root; suffering can be vanquished."
