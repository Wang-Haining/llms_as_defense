            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast expanse of human dealings, culture casts its shadow long and deep. It is defined as much by its absences as by its presence, a specter of many forms. It is neither a monolith nor a singular path. To say all Russians stand immovable or all Japanese yield with ease is to paint with a brush too broad, a canvas too simple. In the heart of negotiation, the keen eye sees beyond the veneer of generalities, seeking the pulse of what a culture truly means to the dance of discourse. When a foreign culture beckons, it is measured against the yardstick of one's own land, and the mind grapples with echoes and reflections.\n\nTo delve into the heart of another culture is to wander through its history, to touch the edges of its biases. Judgment and change are not companions here. Acceptance holds the key, especially when the winds of negotiation blow cold against one's back. In foreign lands, the recognition of customs, the homage to beliefs, can bridge the chasm of difference, nudging the talks forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach does not end at borders drawn upon maps. Within the walls of corporations, a culture all its own takes root. Some demand the sacrifice of hours upon the altar of work, while others embrace a gentler pace. It shows itself in the garments of workers, in the words they choose, in the ways tasks are parceled out. Some firms call upon their kin to give freely, while others bind such acts to sanctioned causes. The American corporate landscape, diverse as its wide plains and bustling cities, is testament to the myriad ways culture breathes life into the notion of work. In lands less fractured, cultures may seem more whole, but beneath that surface lies depth waiting to be unearthed.\n\nIn the end, it is the values that speak the loudest, whispering the reasons why a culture moves as it does. To save face, to hold dear the harmony of the many—such are the tokens that guide a negotiator's hand. A soul from a land where bargains are battles will not yield easily, nor rush to closure. These truths must be carried close, before the table is set and the dance commences. Yet, wisdom lies in knowing the soul across the table, for in their story lies the path to a negotiation well met.",
            "In the quiet of an ancient text, the fool's heart whispers there is no God. Psalm 14, the old scripture, speaks first this thought, and St. Anselm takes it up in his quest for proof of the divine. This belief, shared by the likes of Thomas Aquinas, stands as a citadel in their writings on God's existence. Our task, to weigh which argument holds the greater truth, must begin with a quiet assumption. We shall assume they are both right in their belief, in the God of the Bible, for to entertain a different God would unravel the tapestry of their arguments, leaving us with threads instead of a whole cloth. Yet, in this quiet meditation, I suggest that neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a complete path to belief.\n\nLet us first walk with St. Anselm, whose steps trace a journey of faith. He turns inward, gazing at the soul's landscape, where he finds God etched into the mind’s corners. Anselm speaks of a God whose presence is so deeply woven into our understanding that to imagine otherwise is folly. His words, dense and labyrinthine, tell of a proof that rests not in the world but within the soul's quiet knowing. He invites us to see that the truth of God is not found in the world's clamor but in the silent certainties of the mind. This is faith, the Christian texts say, the acceptance of truths unseen, unproven by the world outside.\n\nContrast this with St. Thomas Aquinas, who stands on the firm ground of reason. To him, God is a truth born of logic and observation, no faith required. His method, a boon to the evangelist, for it builds a bridge of reason to the unconverted, needing no leap into the unseen. Aquinas lays out five paths of reason: the change, the cause, the contingent, the degrees of excellence, and the harmony. Each is a step that shows God as a necessity of logic, a puzzle piece unseen yet whose outline is clear in the picture it completes. Thus, the discourse unfolds, each man offering a different road, yet both leading to the same unseen city.",
            "In the world of letters, authors weave their words with the skill of craftsmen, each turn of phrase coaxing from the page a certain spirit, a certain manner by which we come to know the tale they tell. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he among them, employs such craft in his telling of The Great Gatsby. He conjures images with an unusual marriage of words, pairing the unexpected with the familiar, casting a spell over the reader, an atmosphere suspended in delicate balance. He draws upon the essence of symbols, colors chief among them, to breathe life into the narrative. Gold and green, white and gray, red and pink—each shade is a thread in the tapestry of his world. Their meanings, like whispers on the wind, are built carefully, layer upon layer, until they resonate with the reader's soul.\n\nThe colors white and gray bear a weight of meaning under Fitzgerald's hand, a quiet uniformity, white with its veneer of class, gray with its whispers of time's passage. We see this from the outset as these shades cloak the characters and their world. Daisy and Jordan, always in white—Nick too, in his white flannels at Gatsby's revels, Tom in his white shirt beside Myrtle, and Catherine, powdered milky white. The halls of Gatsby's dwelling, a riot of colors, stand apart, marking a departure from this palette. These hues, white and gray, paint the cityscape and its people—Nick descending amidst the white chasms of New York, the names of Gatsby's guests now gray upon Nick's ledger, Catherine’s home, a white cake of apartments. The world itself is streaked with these colors—Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray cars and gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child's grayness, the gray old man selling dogs.\n\nFitzgerald, thus, arms these colors with the power to denote insignificance, a sameness that envelops certain figures in the tale. Daisy, clad in white, seated in her white roadster, becomes less a person, more an ideal, a thing Gatsby covets. She is the gray haze on a fur collar, the white dress before the duel of words between Tom and Gatsby. Through these hues, Fitzgerald crafts a vision of Daisy as less substance, more shadow, an echo of longing in the heart of a man.",
            "In the mild embrace of San Diego's unyielding sun, the land lays forth its bounty. Tomatoes and citrus fruits, greens of the field, the tender hearts of squash, and the dark crowns of broccoli all find their place in this fertile soil. There too are the herbs, the trees heavy with peaches and lemons, the berries ripening in the light, and honey and peppers, each one a testament to the earth's generosity. There is a hunger here for the pure, the organic, and the earth answers with sustenance. The people wait, their names inscribed upon lists, yearning for the harvest of these lands. Eggs and milk, untouched by the hand of man, flow from these fields to the tables. Upon these farms, life is not merely cultivated but observed, as birds take to the sky and the feet of wanderers tread the paths offered. Here is a place where the landowner might harness the gifts of man’s governance, not just to reap but to preserve, to educate, and to prosper.  \n\nAmidst this bounty, the land speaks of another kind of wealth, one not measured in coin but in life itself. The organic way offers a sanctuary for wild things, for plants and creatures, safe from the taint of chemicals. Yet, it asks a price. The labor is hard, the toil unending. The war against weeds and pests is fought without the familiar weapons, the soil is fed without the ease of synthetics, and the harvest is less certain. The small farm lacks the might of its larger kin, the efficiency that comes with scale. To walk the path of the organic farmer is to embrace the burden of the earth itself, to plant and graze, to remove what does not belong, to shape the land for the life that calls it home. And so, the landowner might seek counsel and assistance, to balance the scales of profit and preservation.\n\nIn this tale, the land rests beside the town of Potrero, in the wilds of San Diego County where the Cleveland National Forest stands as a guardian. It is 160 acres of chaparral and grassland, of oak woodlands whispering to the skies. Here, the ecoregion tells its own story, part of a grand plan to safeguard the lives of many, plants and beasts alike. The land remembers those who came before, the Native Americans who knew its song, and the settlers who sought its promise. This land, once a homestead, where cattle grazed and wood was hewn, now stands at the crossroads of past and future. \n\nI chose this land from the offerings of the modern world and sought to understand what aid might come to one who wishes to farm it in harmony with nature. In doing so, I found a farm nearby, a model of what might be, a place where the earth's voice is heard, and its gifts are given.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, a bond unyielding and beyond recall. Within this tether lie emotions manifold: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, each an ember in the fire of kinship. Brothers, bound by blood, see in one another a mirror of themselves, a reflection clearer than any other bond might conjure. It is when the world turns dire and shadows lengthen that this bond’s true nature reveals itself, be it light or dark. Such revelations come at a cost, their toll exacted in the currency of consequence. To know the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the price they demand. When a brother looks upon his kin and sees his own visage, it is not as the world sees him, but as he is, unadorned. In the deeds done and the echoes they leave behind, therein lies the heart of their character. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers walk the edge of this theme, where emotions rage and swirl like storms. Through a landscape lush and vividly wrought, they embark on a journey destined for ruin. Bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in the tale’s crescendo, and only one brother emerges from the tempest alive. The theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and their shared moments, all seen through the narrator’s eyes, which cast light upon the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his view of the world, both shaping his every act.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist’s deeds lies a singular emotion: pride. From the first steps they take together to their final, fatal trek, he harbors a quiet resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother, one to whom he might impart his worldly skills, the arts of breath-holding, running, leaping, climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with in the high forks of the great pine behind the barn. Yet, these dreams lay shattered, for Doodle was born frail of heart, the specter of death a constant companion, his body ill-suited for the rigors of boyhood fancy. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, whose head teemed with wild imaginings, to find his visions dashed. In his heart, anger stirred, a dark contemplation of ending the small life with a pillow's soft suffocation. What child, in the innocence of youth, might harbor thoughts of such finality? But then, a smile from the small one, a simple curve of lips, and hope unfurls in the protagonist’s heart. This fleeting act reveals that his resolve was not as steel. In the recesses of his mind, love for his brother lay, quiet and instinctive, waiting to be called forth.",
            "In the vast and tangled architecture of the human mind lies a complexity crafted through the ages. Like the deep and ancient forests that once knew only the whisper of the wind, so too has the understanding of the brain evolved from crude beginnings to something more like the precision of a machine. We once likened it to a wax tablet, then to the papyrus scrolls of lost civilizations, and in the march of time, we saw it as a book, and now speak of it as a computer. Yet even these metaphors fall short, like shadows that slip between the fingers, cautioning us against the folly of easy conclusions.\n\nThe journey of thought begins with the senses, those primal gateways that capture the world in all its rawness. The touch, the warmth, the sound that echoes through the empty halls of the universe, the light that falls like a benediction—each is transformed into the secret language of the brain, a code of electrochemical whispers. Here, the brain performs its dance, spinning this raw data with algorithms both simple and profound, weaving it into a tapestry of understanding. In the act of seeing a black box upon a field of white, the mind gathers the simplest truths—color, shape, the sharpness of an edge—and from these, the image is built in the mind's eye. The mind, always a step ahead, uses its top-down wisdom to see not just a shape but a box, not a void but a presence.\n\nYet as the threads of thought are spun, there is a filter that stands sentinel, discerning what is worthy of the mind's full embrace. In the chaos of green blades beneath one’s feet, the mind sees only what it must, turning away from the countless distractions of the world. Yet even in a room awash with noise, a name can pierce the din like a needle through cloth. At each juncture, the mind's attention shapes the form of understanding.\n\nMemory, the keeper of the past, holds the key to the brain's processing. Here, the moments of life are encoded, stored, and maintained within the mind's labyrinth. In the flicker of an instant, sensory memory captures the world. Working memory, ephemeral as the morning mist, holds its charge in the brief dance of electricity among neurons. Long-term memory, like ancient stones, is enshrined in the proteins that endure. Theories abound, each a map of the mind’s hidden geography. Some speak of networks and nodes, a web of connections that links ideas like stars in the night sky, where 'chair' finds kinship with 'table' and both to the living wood from which they were wrought.\n\nIn all this, we seek to understand the unknowable, to map the vast and silent corridors of the mind. And yet, for all our knowing, we remain as pilgrims on a road without end.",
            "In the year 2007, a shadow fell across the land of America. A financial tempest, unseen and unrestrained, spread its ruinous breath over the fortunes of men. Unemployment rose like some specter at the feast, the housing market a shambles, and the great engines of commerce lay broken in the dust. A recession took root and grew in that fertile desolation. And so we ask, how did it come to pass, and by what means might it be undone? The crisis was wrought by the folly of ambition, by the clumsy hands of governance that turned the wheels of finance until they spun themselves to the brink. Banks and firms, coaxed and cajoled, issued loans unfit for the soil they were planted in. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of underwriting, repackaged these mortgages into things unholy. With the borrowers fallen, the banks found their coffers bare, and so the contagion spread, a fire in the dry grasses, consuming all.\n\nIt began long before, in the year 1999, when the President sought to secure his place at the helm for another season. His administration, eager and heedless, loosened the bindings on lending, setting the stage for calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of such things, a Cassandra to deaf ears. Fannie Mae, he wrote, was under the thumb of the Clinton administration, urged to extend its reach into the lower echelons of income, to feed the maw of growth. Ill winds, he foretold, would bring ruin in their wake, and so they did. The script was writ and the actors took their places.\n\nThe economy was a great ship, and its course was altered by many hands. Mortgages, once simple, had grown into beasts of complexity. Adjustable rates and securities backed by the fragile promise of payment. Collateralized debt like the chains of an ancient slave, binding one sector to another. The nation’s households, its markets, all lay overleveraged upon the altar of housing. A bubble swelled and burst, and the financial institutions, those pillars of trade, were laid low. Trillions in mortgage debts, a sum beyond reckoning, weighed upon them. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch fell to the hammer of necessity, Lehman Brothers scattered to the winds, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley remade themselves under the stern gaze of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with debts towering, were taken into the fold of government, a ward against their own collapse.",
            "In the quiet reaches of your tale, where the words stretch out like a desert, lies exposition. It waits, a beast of burden, to carry forth your narrative and yet it might just as likely lay your readers low, lost to dreams or the back button, shaking curses at your name as they retreat. Dr. Merlin, a soul not unfamiliar with the art of storytelling, has been heard to cast her ire at screens when ensnared in the coils of excessive discourse, and not the kind that warms the heart.\n\nExposition, this is not your ally.\n\nMy readers, those gentle souls, have heard the age-old counsel, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in passages where the world stands still or spins out of control. Exposition, that devil perched on your shoulder, whispers of history to be told, urging you to lay it bare before the tale can unfold to its true form. Do not confuse it with the other imp, urging you to recount every detail of each character's past from cradle to grave.\n\nExposition means recounting the past, often in simple prose. In the realm of film, it is the moment where one soul turns to another and spills forth the ballast of the tale like the mariner of old. In fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nConsider this: within the weave of a story, the heroine finds her love, the union is celebrated with grand flourish, and yet he meets his end before her very eyes—this all told in a page or two, their words few and far between. Yet you would expect more of the husband, to see in him through speech and manner the depth of his love. Equally, you would hope to glimpse in her gestures the changes wrought by his presence, the light he cast upon her world. Such would draw you into their lives, their bond, and their loss, binding you to the heroine in her grief.\n\nIn essence, you seek the flesh upon the skeletal tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must weave that flesh. There is the urge to hasten past it all. Perhaps you're sketching a new figure—a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman in his heart, dreaming one day to own that very station, the taste of Eggs Benedict still on his tongue.",
            "In the flickering light of morning, the day's first news from Columbus broke like a distant storm, unbidden and raw. The voice spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, a name now etched in the annals of violence for the stabbing of his wife. The screen flickered with his visage, a face that seemed carved from some dark stone, malevolent and unyielding. Yet, the tale was brief, a mere wisp of time devoted to its unfolding, as if the gravity of the act was yet to settle upon the world.\n\nThe morning's second tale emerged like a shadow, the story of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, struck down in the Sharon Woods as the dawn struggled to break. Critically wounded, nameless in the chaos, with no hand held accountable. The SWAT team prowled the edges of this mystery, but the story itself seemed to pass like a ghost in the early air. The specter of neglect hovered there, a familiar refrain where the blood of minorities often fades too swiftly from the public eye. If it were another child, one of lighter skin, the clamor would rise to the heavens. Yet here, the silence was palpable.\n\nThen came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, pierced by a bullet's whisper, the place of its wounding unknown. A .22 caliber rifle, the voice said, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of reward, a sum of five thousand for the soul who might bring justice to bear. But this too was fleeting, a mere moment in the continuum of the broadcast.\n\nThe sky threatened rain, the forecasters spoke, and storms were promised for the afternoon, a brief interlude of tempests amid the heat of the weekend. Such was the brevity of this tale, a lure to hold the listener's ear.\n\nThe tale of the Clime Road UDF robbery followed, the description of a man cloaked in shadow, a dark-skinned black man swathed in a hoodie. The words lingered over his complexion, a curious fixation upon his shade as if the darkness itself was a part of the crime.\n\nLastly, there came the story of Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in hushed tones, a kingpin of drugs from the sun-hardened plains of Texas. A conspiracy laid bare, marijuana flowing northward to Ohio. The sentence was spoken in months, three hundred of them, as if to stretch the years into eternity. The fact of his Hispanic heritage was mentioned, an extraneous detail, perhaps, yet there it was, woven into the fabric of the story like a thread of shadow.\n\nAnd so, the day wore on, each tale a fragment of the world, echoing into the silence beyond the screen.",
            "In the world of financial instruments, an ETF—known as an exchange traded fund—moves like a shadow in the market, tethered to the pulse of an index or perhaps a commodity, or a collection of assets as an index fund might, yet it bears the nimbleness of a stock. It offers the broad horizon of an index while granting the focused power of a single stock—a means to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim as little as a singular share in any given transaction. Such enticements draw many to them, yet ETFs whisper of lower expense ratios than the common mutual fund. The path is not without its thorns, for to tread in the realm of ETFs is to pay a commission each time, akin to any stock venture. Yet the landscape is vast, with a multitude of funds to choose from. Despite these clear enticements, the prudent investor must always discern if the promised spread of diversification truly exists and to what extent, like a prospector sifting through sand for gold. \n\nTo this end, we cast our gaze upon ETF IHF, examining it against the top ten holdings within its confines, seeking to ascertain if the fruits of a singular ETF can mirror the bounty of owning a scattered portfolio of those ten stocks, or if another configuration might yield a sharper ratio or greater return. Yet to avoid the cumbersome task of considering each holding, we shall limit ourselves to the foremost ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below, the top ten holdings stand, each with its share of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these stocks stand as a reflection of the ETF IHF, we turn to the current percentage of assets, recalibrated to a full hundred, to measure each stock's weight in the portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were solely these ten stocks, each in the proportion ordained by their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the table below.\n\nFrom this table, it becomes clear: a portfolio of just these top ten holdings brings forth a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a rise of 16% in gains. A further revelation shows the Beta of these ten holdings sits .12 beneath that of the ETF entire. Thus, it appears that a portfolio crafted from these top ten might deliver higher returns at a lower beta. Yet, shadows remain, for these portfolios might not differ statistically in their means.\n\nTo discern this mystery, we delve into the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, recalibrated to a full hundred, to weigh their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "The days turned cold and the sun cast a weary light over the campus in that New England clime. With winter's grasp, the numbers fell away, those commuter logs dwindling like leaves from the trees. It was as if the very spirit of the venture had fled. Folks, wrapped in their old coats and scarves, trudged through December, their thoughts elsewhere. The semester's end loomed like a heavy curtain, and the minds of men and women were consumed with tasks that bore them down. The logs, neglected, faded from view, lost amid the noise of closing books and ringing bells. Holidays arrived with their own demands, and the campus lay silent, a ghost of its former self. \n\nJanuary returned with its promise of new beginnings, but the cold yet held sway, and the logs remained few. February came and went, a mystery unsolved, like tracks in the snow that lead nowhere. The initial fervor had passed, leaving only the quiet echo of what once was. March brought with it a challenge, a call to arms—Carpool Week, they named it—a final attempt to stir the embers, to coax life back into the forgotten cause. And for a time, it seemed to work. Yet the struggle was ever present, the battle against the lull of holidays and the rhythm of the academic year.\n\nIn truth, the heart of the matter lay deeper still. The open road had a hold on them, the freedom of the wheel and the solitude of a car’s cabin. It was a part of who they were, ingrained in their very bones. To lure them away required more than just good intention. Prizes were given, tokens of gratitude for those who took the road less traveled. But the prizes themselves were humble, perhaps too much so. The thought lingered of what might have been, a bicycle or an electric car, something grand to draw them in. Had the stakes risen with each passing month, perhaps the story would have unfolded differently. Yet, as it stood, the gifts remained small, and the numbers told their tale. The path forward lay uncertain, like a road disappearing into the mist.",
            "In the dim archives of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I found myself drawn to the flickering remnants of early Edison films. I resolved to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, those fifteen pieces spun between 1895 and 1901, each a testament to the nascent art of illusion born from the silent frames of celluloid. These films, with their beguiling craft, leaned upon the sleight of hand that clever editing could conjure. My study was a quiet unraveling of the poetics that defined most of these trick films, and a probing glance at those few among them that stood apart in their evolutionary stride, daring to breach the constraints of their era. \n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, bound to its place, framed within the rigid proscenium like a prisoner in a cell. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, would not shift its gaze to follow the players upon the stage. The choreography was borrowed from the theater, an echo of vaudeville and the conjurer’s art. Movement was confined to the narrow line between the wings, never toward or away from the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, circa 1900, where figures drift across the frame from right to left, never venturing into the depth of the scene. Even as they fade from view, the camera remains oblivious, anchored to its post.\n\nThe proscenium style cast its spell over the composition, dictating that all shots were long, and at times, medium. Close-ups were absent, unseen in the early Edison catalog, for the tradition was born of the theater where a spectator embraced the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's limits. Actors were stranded in the middle ground, distant from the lens, and thus, the intimacy of close-up was a stranger to these early frames.\n\nIn the infancy of the trick film, it was customary that a single shot would encompass the entirety of a film’s vision. The narrative was a fleeting wisp, constrained to mere seconds, dictated by the relentless ticking of the frames. Stories were sparse, mere whispers of vaudeville trickery—magic acts, disappearing acts—devoid of tale or drama. Yet, within this constraint lay a subtle deceit. The illusion of a singular shot belied the hidden seams where frames were stitched together to conjure apparitions or vanishing acts. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from the year 1895. Look closely, and the ruse reveals itself—the moment where Mary’s severed “head” joins the physical reel, though to the eye of the beholder, it remains a single unbroken vision.",
            "In those days when the Gothic novel found its first breath, it was as if the old world had birthed something new and strange, an odd marriage of contradictions. Ian Watt spoke of it, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his musings on the birth of this peculiar genre. It was both dismissed and exalted, this mode of writing, spoken of with disdain for lack of depth and yet revered for the 'terrible sublime' it seemed to conjure, as Burke might have noted. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto was the harbinger, binding the ancient with the modern, forging a path for those who would follow. In it, he took the old theatrical ways and wove them with the mimicry of nature that marked the novels of his time, creating what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe Gothic form was a refuge for relics of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. Even as Walpole penned his tale, the word \"gothic\" was a mutable thing, a descriptor that had been thrown at various peoples, styles, and ages, seen as something archaic and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modern progress. Yet this melding of the theatrical with the novel form, which let a reader peer into the minds of characters, gave the Gothic its longevity, making it a relic and a revelation at once to readers long removed from its origin.\n\nAmong the Gothic's echoes was the notion of Chivalry, that ancient code of the knight, a concept both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held weight for the Gothic scribes for what it symbolized—the knight of old, brave and true—and against the perceived decay of such ideals in the society they knew. The chivalric became romanticized, a glimpse backward to guide the present, perhaps even foreshadowing the Romantic to come. Walpole, writing in troubled times, saw shadows in the future and perhaps lamented a loss of virtue among his contemporaries. In his story, Frederic stands as a figure shaped by these ideals. Before Frederic steps forth, his presence is felt, a prince of chivalry, marred by tragedy and believed felled by infidels. He looms as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" exaggerated in form, foreshadowing the Gothic's love of excess. The characters breathe this chivalric air, and in them, Walpole's longing for an ideal lost is made manifest.",
            "In the quiet backwaters of commerce, the lifeblood of trade flows unseen from the moment a customer's need takes shape to the time it becomes a tangible reality. This procession, known as supply chain management, weaves its way through raw beginnings, through the sinews of supply, through the heart of production, and outward to the wide world of distribution. It was in the year 1982 that Keith Oliver, a man with the eyes of a seer and the mind of a tactician, gave this journey a name, a framework upon which the needs of man might be met with speed and precision. He spoke of it as a grand orchestration, a series of steps to be laid down with care and foresight.\n\nSix pillars uphold this structure, each as vital as the next: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools with which the stewards of industry craft their promises to the waiting world.\n\nIt begins with production, the genesis of all that follows. Here, the questions of when and why, of where and how, find their answers. Managers, like watchful shepherds, must discern the desires of their flock. The market, in its ceaseless ebb and flow, whispers its secrets to those who listen. With understanding comes decision, the what and the how many, the where and the which. The place of creation must be chosen with an eye to both the quantity and the quality demanded by those who wait. Schedules must be woven with the threads of time, and the machines made ready for their relentless toil. In this dance of creation, every step is crucial, for any misstep may squander both time and treasure.\n\nI have seen this with my own eyes, in the vast halls of Wal-Mart and Target. There, every aspect of the enterprise is set down, a script for the actors in this grand performance. From the attire of the laborer to the receipt of goods from distant lands, all is ordered, all is known. Such clarity breeds efficiency, and through it, the gears of business turn without the friction of uncertainty.\n\nNext comes supply, the lifeline upon which the success of all rests. It is a realm of choices, of which capabilities to nurture and which to entrust to others. A single product may have many paths to its creation, each with its own tools and hands, its own artistry. The manager, with the wisdom of Solomon, must choose the path that best serves the whole. And sometimes, the path leads outward, to partners beyond the walls of the company. This is done for the sake of speed, of velocity, the alchemy that turns quality into affordability, that renders the impossible possible.\n\nThese are the elements, the bones upon which the flesh of commerce is hung. And in their proper alignment, they carry forth the promise of fulfillment to the waiting world.",
            "The Victorian novels, with their meticulous attention to the minutiae of life and their devotion to the tales of the aristocracy, stand as monuments to an age now faded. Yet within this tapestry of gilded words, two stories emerge that diverge from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These tales, shrouded in mystery and tinged with the bizarre, reach beyond the conventional, drawing forth the very essence of their characters and laying bare the motives and emotions that drive them.\n\nAn uneasy consciousness shadowed Oliver, a specter of pain and fear that never ceased its torment. He walked as if in a dream, caught between the harsh voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words echoing in his mind. The sudden crack of gunfire jarred him, and he was swept away by unseen hands, lost in a tumult of cries and shouts, lights flaring before his eyes—a cacophony of chaos that blurred the lines of reality. In these visions, his powerlessness was laid bare, his senses dulled, his fate not his own. The shooting, a specter relived in his dreams, underscored his lack of control, his life teetering on the brink, held in the grip of forces beyond his ken. The hand of old Fagin, ever-present, seemed to tighten its hold, bending Oliver's will to despair, a slow breaking of spirit that left him unable to muster even the faintest resistance.\n\nThe day slipped away, a fleeting ghost swallowed by night, a night stretched thin with silence yet swift in its passing. Time, elusive and intangible, flowed through the dark hours, leaving behind only the residue of dreams and the shadows of what might have been.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the company of children, guiding them through the tangled thickets of learning. It was an after-school program, a place where young minds grappled with the lessons of the day. My hands were strongest in the realms of English and reading, and it was there I was called upon to aid a boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps in the third or fourth grade, and he struggled mightily with the written word.\n\nThere was something amiss, I knew. The boy could speak as well as any, yet when it came to the letters on the page, he faltered. Some letters he could sound out clear as a bell, others eluded him entirely. It was a curious thing. Adrian was of Latino descent, that much was plain, but his English was flawless. We stumbled along together until the day his mother appeared. \n\nI was minding a few stragglers while the others ventured on a field trip when she walked in. Adrian’s mother spoke not a word of English, her tongue Spanish alone. With my halting Spanish, we managed a conversation of sorts. And then it struck me, like a sudden clap of thunder: Adrian's trouble lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet itself. It was a revelation, and whether it helped him then I cannot say, but I hold a hope that he fares better now.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the language barriers that rise like great walls in our schools, here in California and beyond. It is not always as it seems, this obstacle of language. Even a child who speaks English with ease may find its written form an immense challenge. So what path do we walk to remedy this? In Adrian’s case, a simple tutoring of letters and sounds sufficed. But for those who speak little English, the way is more convoluted. There is no single remedy. A blend of methods—dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—each plays its part.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for those whose native tongue is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this idea, a fear that it squanders resources, that most children gain nothing. But this is false. Were we to make such programs the rule rather than the exception, all would benefit. But how to achieve this? Demanding all teachers be bilingual is a step too far, a dream too distant. Yet, there is no reason we cannot employ aides or tutors who are, to guide this journey.",
            "From the time we draw breath, we are told of things larger than ourselves, of vastness beyond grasp, of mysteries that lace the world like shadows in the night. We are sent to learn of these things in places of worship or introspection, to seek answers that others have sought before us. Many of us accept the stories handed down from our forebears, as one might inherit a keepsake tarnished with time. Yet some of us, in our rebellion or despair, deny these stories, claiming there is nothing beyond the borders of our own small worlds. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to cast them off like old clothes and don the new. In whatever way we tread, we seek to carve out a piece of ourselves with the chisel of our own notions of the divine. We wander, searching for a glimmer in the gloom to lead us from the shadows and into the light.\n\nA cardinal, he said, when I asked him the question. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless beat on the tin above us, and shared our silence like an old song. The rainwater coursed through the gutters, drowning the flowers that lined the porch, as if seeking to obliterate all trace of life. He looked out at the rain, his gaze a lost thing, caught between memory and dream. He had grown frail in those final months, his clothes hanging on him like ghosts of days past. His hair, once thick, had thinned, a whisper of what it was. He watched the rain still, as if in its falling he found some unspoken truth. I sat there with him, the words I could not say lodged in my throat, for to speak them would make them real. I moved closer, our chairs almost touching, and together we watched the rain fall in the twilight of that June evening.\n\nHe left us in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments had granted him a reprieve, a few more months, though at what cost I could not reckon. What god, I asked myself, allows such suffering? Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a god, I thought, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not want to watch him slip from this world to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the fading of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than the rest, better than those who watched over him at the end. He would not have wished for me to stand vigil at his passing. And so I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that came as quiet as a breath.\n\nBut no one called.",
            "In the long shadow of the Virginian fields where the earth holds its secrets and the sun beats down relentless as truth, there lived a man named John Taylor of Caroline. A man whose heart beat in time with the Republican dream and whose life was a testament to the soil and the sweat that it demands. An agrarian by blood and by belief, he walked the path of politics just long enough to carve his name into the stone of liberty, speaking out with a voice unyielding in matters of freedom and the reach of government. For Taylor, the land was sacred and the tilling of it a noble act upon which all else was built—his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the courts themselves rooted in this belief.\n\nThe land of the free held promise like an unbroken colt, wild and unencumbered by the chains of tradition. Taylor saw this vast expanse and in it the chance to craft a new covenant of governance. A place where the rights of a man stood as tall as the mountains and as unassailable as the stars. Each right a thread in the fabric of freedom, and if one were to fray, the whole would unravel, leaving nothing but the shadows of what once was. To Taylor, the state of nature was a place where the strong and the cunning held sway, a lawless land where might made right, but this was not to be the way of civilization.\n\nIn the crafting of this society, Taylor held firm to the belief that a government must embrace the duality of man, the light and the dark that reside in every soul. His words were as stern as the rocks of the riverbed, declaring that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles, he claimed, were the guardians of property and the stewards of the fields, standing in defiance of the encroaching tide of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles would remain true, no matter the greed and ambition of those who ruled. For self-interest was the compass by which man navigated, its morality judged by whether it served the common good or the selfish few. It was a good government that could harness this nature, but always under the watchful eye lest it stray into corruption.\n\nAmong the Republicans, Taylor stood resolute, calling for the Constitution to be held like scripture, its words binding and its powers limited. The Federal government, a beast that must be kept lean and its reach short, for fear of despotism lurking in the shadows of its ambition. Yet, he knew too that words alone were not enough. Their true meaning lay in the hearts of those who penned them, and without such understanding, the letter of the law could twist into tyranny. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true lodestar of the nation, a testament to a union of states, each sovereign and strong, rather than a single, monolithic entity.\n\nAnd so, John Taylor of Caroline stood, a solitary figure against the horizon, his life a testament to the land he loved and the freedoms he cherished, a voice echoing across the ages, calling us back to the principles upon which this nation was built.",
            "Downward he gazed, mind adrift in the empty fathom of the sight laid before him. Without a sound, without the stirrings of emotion, he beheld with an awareness honed over time, an awareness that dissected yet refused to tie the dissected parts to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted into his consciousness and then away, as if borne on some invisible current, too swift to grasp, too elusive to own. Such was the smooth, seamless dance of his faculties that it seemed he had no thoughts to claim as his own, merely a fluid engagement with what lay in his gaze.  \n\nOnce upon counsel from an artist of his acquaintance, he acquired a tome on the craft titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, the desire to learn the art of drawing had clung to him, and this book promised to unveil the secrets—from the essence of a pencil to the brain's alchemy of line and form. One lesson it offered was the use of a square frame to isolate the artist's subject. Thus, a chaotic tableau, a fruit bowl ensconced in a kitchen that opens into a dining room, could be distilled into a singular, manageable vision, that bowl of fruit centered on its simple plane.  \n\nYet there he stood, eyes fixed upon the bowl before him, unable to summon that artist's frame. Overcome, awestruck, he could only stand and marvel in silence. Picasso had his blue period; Monet reveled in verdant hues; the Italian Renaissance masters painted with a spectrum unbounded. Should he dare to claim his view as Artistic, there before him lay the embryo of his creation, the dawn of his narrative, his Work in Brown.  \n\nHis fingertips alighted on his chosen tool of creation, sinews tensed and released, his hand traversing the space between, his mind's resolve shaping itself in what might have been the most creative act of his existence. Water swirled, tranquil and unblemished, clear as crystal. Bits of matter departed from the whole, carried off to oblivion. Muscles tensed anew, twitching with impatience and resolve, his hand struck the toilet handle once more. The obstinate brown mass refused to yield, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain bottom.  \n\nMop held loosely in hand, feet braced a foot apart, the green tie tight around his neck, he frowned slightly at the insolent mass of processed life left as a testament to those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the wall to his right, seized the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it was swathed like an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended slowly into the bowl, akin to a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dusk of a world where youth takes the wheel too soon, there is a grim tally of lives lost among those who are yet to see the fullness of their days. The young drivers of America, bound by the chains of their own inexperience and the unripe nature of their minds, find themselves adrift on the highways of a perilous freedom. The National Institutes of Health speak of brains unfinished, of instincts not yet honed to the sharpness demanded by the unyielding road. Their hands, unsteady upon the wheel, steer them into the shadows of tragedy. \n\nIt is not the solitary road that claims them, but the presence of their peers beside them, the laughter and the clamor of youth unchecked. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has studied this dance of folly and found that with each young soul added to the vehicle, the specters of accident and ruin draw closer.\n\nIn the sunlit halls of governance, California and its kin have sought to lay down laws to shepherd these fledgling drivers, to bind them with provisional licenses that restrict their passage through the night and forbid the company of their fellows. Yet these are but frail barriers against the tide of statistics that mark the youngest among us as unfit for the burdens they bear. \n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze upon the reckless heart of youth and finds even eighteen too tender an age for such heavy responsibility. USA Today whispers of his research, of the youthful thirst for danger that does not abate until the years have tempered it. To delay the granting of license until this wildness subsides would be wisdom, a shield against the impending toll. For the day approaches when the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood the roads, a legion of potential peril.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this plight would not be a tangled affair. Schools could continue their teachings, sowing the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day earn the right to drive. But none under eighteen would take the wheel alone. A provisional phase would still precede the full rite of passage, and the hours of practice would remain—a number forged from the common practices of the states, such as the six hours behind the wheel and fifty hours with a guide that California demands.\n\nThe need for a unified, national decree is clear, for the specter of youth lost on the road is not confined to one land or another. It is a plight that demands a single voice, a singular act of protection for all who would step into the realm of the driver. This is not a new thought, but it is one whose time is come.",
            "In the quiet of the mind's labyrinth, where sounds are more than mere echoes, lies the enigma of Central Auditory Processing Disorder. It is a disorder not of the ear's hearing but of the brain's understanding. The disorder, known as CAPD or APD, speaks to the inefficiency of the central nervous system in translating the world of sound. Sounds that are clear as day to the ear become lost in the shadowed corridors of the mind, where words blend and noises become an indistinguishable hum. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association tells us that it is the perceptual processing of auditory information that falters, leaving the afflicted adrift in a sea of sound without a compass.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder, then called \"auditory imperception,\" came in the mid-1950s. Researchers, like wanderers in a dark wood, began to uncover the disorder's path. It was an Italian team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who first laid the stones for this path in 1954. Then came Kimura in 1961, with dichotic testing and a model to illuminate the physiology of the auditory system, like a lantern casting its light into the dark. By 1977, a conference gathered the minds of the time, sparking a flame of inquiry into the disorder that would be known as CAPD.\n\nThe disorder wears many faces. It is the inability to locate sound in space, a voice calling out but its source unknown. It is the muddling of acoustic events, two sounds that become one. It is the failure to recognize sound patterns, the music of the world reduced to a cacophony. It is the loss of speech's subtleties, sarcasm slipping past unnoticed. A sound blocked by another, an auditory puzzle unsolved. The clues that are heard but not understood, the sequence of sound lost in the shuffle. These are the hallmarks of CAPD.\n\nDiagnosis is a journey through observation and testing, a path walked by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. It is a landscape of questionnaires and surveys, where the patient's auditory behaviors are observed like a distant horizon. There is no single map, no consistent test to diagnose with certainty, and the cause remains elusive. Tests abound, challenging the patient to pick out words from a chorus, numbers from a din. Advanced tests peer into the ear, measuring the mind's response to the signals it receives.\n\nIn the end, the disorder remains a shadow on the mind, a whisper in the dark. It is a journey for the teachers who guide these children, to light their way in the mainstreamed classroom, to help them find their place in the world of sound.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, I find myself drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I aim to bring solace to children battered by life's cruelties and to offer a hand to families adrift in turmoil. I carry with me certain values, simple yet weighty: service, respect, an ethical spirit, a steadfastness to mend the ties between souls, and an unwavering resolve to hone my own craft, to remain ever adept in my chosen path. These are not mere tenets of the trade; they are the marrow of my being.\n\nThere was a time when the path lay shrouded, and I wandered in uncertainty. Yet always did I harbor a yearning to aid others. Through the corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many who turned their backs on woes that shadowed them, a few embracing poor crutches as their companions. It was in the face of such scenes that I turned to the study of the mind, seeking a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the path ahead remained obscured, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer’s day, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxiously on a couch, seeking refuge from the hands of his tormentors—his own kin. The next day he summoned the law to his home, and I, feeling the stirring within, went to see if I could be of aid. I spoke with the officers, sharing my recent schooling in Psychology. With the law’s limitations laid bare, they asked me to speak with the boy’s parents. In their presence, I found a pair cloaked in unease, their words mere smokescreens for their actions, painting their child as manipulative for seeking outside aid in resolving what they deemed \"simple\" disputes. It was then that the path of social work began to take shape before me, a calling to untangle such \"simple\" knots within the fabric of family life.\n\nAnother stone in the foundation of social work is the pursuit of social justice. In these times, society holds the individual to a pedestal, yet mourns those lost to the ages without truly understanding the essence of uniqueness. We profess the value of the individual, yet strive to mirror the many. I am but one, yet I resist the chains that seek to bind me to others' molds. Throughout my schooling, I stood against the tides of social injustice—my hair colored with defiance, my clothing a testament to self, my ears pierced beyond the ordinary. I pledged allegiance with the GSBA, fighting the specters of racism and discrimination wherever they reared their heads. I am a believer in social justice, and my protest against injustice shall not cease.",
            "In the bleak corridors of human understanding, where shadows cast by science and society meet, there lies the discourse on insomnia. Here, the biological and sociocultural models stand as sentinels, each offering its own fractured light upon the disorder. The biological tale is one of inheritance and the silent whispers of genes. The sociocultural tale speaks of the world's weight, of race and class and the myriad ties that bind a soul to its place in the order of things. What follows is an examination of insomnia through these dual lenses, a weaving of research threads that seek to unravel the intricacies of disorder. Each study, each finding laid bare, is scrutinized for its truths and its failings.\n\nSleep, that elusive balm, can be troubled in many forms. The mind, restless and unyielding, may birth its own demons. Or perhaps the body, through the ravages of substance or malady, refuses the peace of slumber. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to the specters that haunt the night. Insomnia, that failure to find rest, and its counterpart, hypersomnia, the struggle to stay awake. Narcolepsy, where dreams intrude unbidden upon the waking world. These disorders, each with its own dark signature, are the focus here, particularly insomnia, viewed through the lens of the biological and sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of biology, the story unfolds in the silent workings of neurons, the dance of chemicals and the legacy of genes. Within the hypothalamus, orexin neurons hold sway over the tides of sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice, creatures of the night, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors, guardians of slumber. The activation of these receptors, a gentle push toward sleep, a lesson learned from the simple creatures that scurry beneath the moon's gaze. The implication, a whisper that the same truths might hold for humans, that these receptors, inherited or altered, could govern a person's journey into the night. \n\nYet, the sociocultural tale is a different one, a tale of inheritance not just of genes but of circumstance. The world, with its relentless demands, its school and work and the mundane tasks that make up a life, would bear heavily on those whose sleep is disturbed. For the absence of rest is a thief, robbing focus and sapping strength, a burden carried through the long gray hours of day. Thus, insomnia stands at the crossroads of biology and society, a testament to the complex weave of human existence.",
            "I have wandered these grounds of University Park for what now counts as two and a half years, or four and a half semesters by the reckoning of the calendar, and the journey across this sprawling campus is no small matter. In the days of my freshman year, they put me up in a room at East Halls, cast away at the eastern fringe of this academic world, beyond which lies the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From my home in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning like Willard building, set near the heart of campus, it could be a long, cold march of twenty-five minutes on foot, especially when the State College weather conspired against me. \n\nI spoke with an alum, not many years my senior, who told of times when East Halls were isolated by vast swathes of unused earth. Those empty lands now brim with sports fields and grand new edifices, the Creamery, and a building for health services, encircled by apartments. The campus swells, and with its growth, the task of traversing it becomes more onerous. What remedy for this plight of movement? On a college ground, it is the bicycle that offers salvation. Yet a bicycle alone is naught without the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nA friend of mine, returned to the bicycle after years of neglect, mused why he ever forsook it. \"Bikes are a boon,\" he said. \"For a time, the fashion turned against them, but they are the only way to roam.\" Beyond the boon to body and health, cycling stands as the swiftest means of passage. A bowl of oatmeal and the strength of your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. Like others of my kind, I dwell off campus now, a distance from the center akin to that of some dorms. The wisest choice I made this year was to claim a bicycle as my own. Every day, I am called to class in Thomas building, a journey of twenty-five minutes on foot from my abode. With a bicycle, that time is cut to five minutes if I push hard enough. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, poses its own challenges for those on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, but time is a scarce commodity. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas daily would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my day. Over a week, that sums to more than two and a half hours. Add to that the minutes spent on other walks to classes, meetings, and so forth. It is time I cannot afford to lose.",
            "In the dim corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley casts a shadow over the march of technology and the capitalist edifice that props it, painting a landscape barren and stark with the specter of a dystopia. Within those pages, the souls that tread do so in the name of community, a unity forged at the cost of the self, each mind conditioned from the cradle to chase the hollow echo of immediate joy. They wander, these denizens, as pieces upon a board unseen, their paths carved by the unseen hand of the World Controller, an architect of their singular creed. Glance through the pane of Marxist theism and see the author’s wariness laid bare, a distrust threaded through the loom of those burgeoning systems. Terms of Marxist discourse—homogeny, reification—stand as sentinels, whispering Huxley’s cautionary tale of the economy’s birth pangs from his epoch’s womb.\n\nCapitalism stands mocked, a parody spun from the Marxist cloth of false consciousness. Herein, the common folk wander blind to the ties binding them to other castes in commerce’s dance, their eyes fixed upon their own reflections. Such blindness, borne of ideological chains, grips the proletariat and laborers, stark in the somnolent conditioning of Brave New World’s people. Deltas and Gammas, puppets all, driven by hypnopædia’s relentless chant to consume, to squander, to revel, a chorus orchestrated by the World Controller. The specter of hegemony looms, a dominion of one class over others, complete and unyielding. The lower castes remain in the dark, complicit in their own deception, bartering their souls for the gilded cage of capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, Alphas, Betas, with eyes open yet closed, content in their gilded chains, save for the few voices like Bernard, who dare to question the chains that bind. The interplay of these classes, as shall be unraveled, speaks to the fetters of capitalism’s grip.\n\nIn this world, true connections wither and die. Brave New World sketches its characters as shadows, bereft of life’s depth and color. Huxley hints at a truth: the twin specters of advancing technology and capitalism strip man of will and voice. Love’s flame is snuffed, and the spectrum of emotion dims to gray. Interactions drift upon the surface, men’s words of women reduced to flesh alone, women’s tales of encounters laid bare without shame. Complacency with their lot marks each class, testament to capitalism’s socioeconomic toll. Their unwavering march within the community’s bounds echoes Marxist thought—the proletariat, lulled into believing their dominion, while they consume, while they obey, while they march in lockstep with destiny’s decree.",
            "It was near four years gone when I took to studying the ways of Islam at the college. There in the room of learning, we did argue and debate over the nature of this faith, whether it bore any malice upon the world. It seems to me now, in these days of shadow and remembrance, that such a question holds more weight than at any time before. Since the towers fell and the earth trembled, I have seen the gaze of the world shift from one of suspicion towards Islam to a strange kind of acceptance within the lands of America. I reckon back in the year of 2001, the thought of a man called Barack Obama, with his roots tangled in the soil of the Muslim world, rising to seek the nation's highest seat would have been a notion met with disbelief.\n\nThe tale of the Prophet draws me in, for it is a curious thing, this recounting of Muhammad’s life, which seems to stand apart from the man himself as history has told it to me. I had thought him a conqueror, bending tribes to his will and faith by the sword’s edge. Yet, the story presents him as a martyr misunderstood, one who bore humility and whom others came to follow of their own accord, seeking the light in his words.\n\nThere are tales within that speak of wonders, akin to those of Jesus, and they sit uneasy with me. Like when Muhammad took the mutton and the milk and made it plenty for forty hungry souls. It seems to me the writers wished to paint him as a prophet of humble truth, content in his miracles. Yet, such writings seem to diminish the miracles of Christ, as though they would steal from His life and deeds to crown another.\n\nThe stories are many, and they speak of those who found their way to Islam, tales told through the voices of others, whispered down the line from one to another. And yet, I find this manner of storytelling suspect, for it seeks to lend weight to the truth yet strips the tales of their own.\n\nWhat stirs unrest within me is this effort to raise Muhammad as a man of gentle spirit and grace. But the annals of time tell a different story, one of power and conquest. I wonder if those who follow him now truly know the path he walked to claim his place in the world.",
            "The world turns and the teachings of the Nazarene linger as a whisper among the windswept plains of time. From his life onward, the course of Christian thought charted a path away from its original shores. In the wide arc of history, a drift is seen. A gulf that grows between the past and the present. The world today dances with a new awareness, a progress that moves in tides uncharted. Yet there are those who clutch to the old ways, who stand rooted as if against a storm, unmoved by the winds of change. They are few, their voices thin in the vast choir of time. Among believers, a hunger stirs. A thirst to peel back the years, to sift the truth from the dust of doctrines layered thick by time. It may take long years, decades, even centuries, but the wheel will turn. A great reversion will come. The march of history will bend back upon itself. A movement like the tide will rise, cleansing the layers of doctrine, stripping away the years until only the bare truth remains. That which the Nazarene spoke to the world. When this tide sweeps through lands, through the cities of the West, a new worship will rise. Pure and unadorned. And the church, the great institution, will stand as a beacon. Yet as the clock rewinds, a strange thing will happen. Diversity will give way, yielding to a sameness of belief and practice. Across the lands and seas, among the many sects, the differences will wane. Human history knows such reversals. Once, the Christians were hunted, shunned, slain by the might of Rome. Yet in time, Rome itself bowed to the cross. Our own nation walked the long road from chains to leadership. So it will be in the realm of faith. A return to the source, a stripping away of the years. And all this will hinge on a new understanding of the Nazarene's words. Not as fixed and solid, but as fluid, as metaphor. So what has been wrought since his time? Look far enough and you find only the roots of Judaism, the seedbed of Christian faith. A single God, the revealed word, the authority of the ancient texts. Such was the heart of faith when Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem. Yet within the Jewish fold, there was division. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the silent majority. Each a voice in an ancient chorus, each a thread in the tapestry of time.",
            "The world laid out in the pages of The Jungle is a testament to the dark and immutable greed that seeps through the veins of men. In the dim corridors of their hearts, there is but a hunger to sate their own desires, to carve out a slice of life that is theirs alone, heedless of the cries of those beneath them. Sinclair's narrative is a grim tapestry woven with the threads of ambition and indifference, its loom the great factories that rise like monoliths over the landscape, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke that stain the sky and the earth below. The owners, the managers, are architects of ruin, their vision tunneled and blind to the suffering that trails in their wake. In Sinclair's own words, the skyline is marred by these edifices of industry, the smoke a testament to the disregard they hold for life, human or otherwise.\n\nWithin the bowels of these factories, men are but cogs in a relentless machine, their worth measured in dollars and discarded when their usefulness wanes. The seething cauldron of jealousy and spite is their world, a place where loyalty is a currency long spent and decency an echo of something lost. Workers toil through hours that stretch like shadows, only to be cast aside without warning, their livelihoods snatched away by the whims of those who see them as nothing more than numbers on a ledger. In those times, the law held no solace for the laborer; the world was a wild place where power was unchecked and men were driven to the brink by the demands of progress.\n\nYet Sinclair's tale does not speak it plain; it is a whisper through the clamor of industry that the souls who labored and perished in Packingtown were bound to endure the misery thrust upon them. No savior came in the form of agency or organization to lend them aid, only the hollow promise of unions that fed upon the very lifeblood they claimed to protect. Trapped in a cycle as unforgiving as the machines they served, they were likened to slaves of old, their chains forged by hunger and desperation. A population teetering on the edge of starvation, their lives held ransom by men as ruthless as any slaver, their fates entwined with the capriciousness of those who held the reins of power. Immorality seeped into the very fabric of their existence, as inevitable as the dawn that broke over the smoke-choked horizon.",
            "In the darkened realm of literary echoes, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the shadows cast by those who came before. Thulé, a term that slips twice from the poet's quill, finds its roots tangled in the ancient lines of Virgil, whispered from the edge of the known world north of Britain. Yet, in the deepening dusk of his interests, Poe found allure in the Germanic whispers of Goethe’s voice. This affinity for Goethe's pen is not a mere shadow of imitation but a dialogue across the abyss of time, a kinship noted by Karl J. Arndt in his scholarly musings.\n\nGoethe, the architect of Faust's tragic saga, penned \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale heavy with the sorrow of a king, bereft of his queen, clutching a goblet as his sole companion. The king's life unwound like a dark fable, his possessions scattered to the winds save for that cup, which he cast into the sea before embracing his end. Such a spectral king, a reflection perhaps of Poe’s own lamentations and liquid solace, mirrors the landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" where color fades and dead friends haunt the lonely traveler.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thule, once within the torture-wrought walls of \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice as the somber pillars of \"Dream-Land,\" speaks to a deeper kinship with Goethe's mournful monarch. The world Poe sketches is a shadow of Goethe's, a dreamscape where the living and the dead coexist in a twilight devoid of color. Here, Poe, like Goethe's king, wanders through a world dimmed by loss, where the echoes of a bygone life linger like a haunting refrain.\n\nGoethe’s presence in the literary firmament was one that Poe could not ignore, not only for Goethe’s own sake but through the light cast by Tennyson's reverence. In this tangled web of influence and respect, Poe found himself entwined with Goethe’s legacy, a legacy that had seeped into the fabric of the time, woven into countless retellings and adaptations. Thus, \"Dream-Land\" becomes not merely a poem but a bridge, a spectral dialogue with the past, where Poe and Goethe stand like twin phantoms on the edge of eternity.",
            "The sun had long since begun its descent behind the California hills and the aisles of the grocery lay in a kind of twilight. It was there, on the cold tiles, that the applesauce lay spilled like some forgotten offering to the gods of negligence. Could a customer, injured in such a fall, find justice in punitive damages by laying bare the heart of the store's keeper, who twice had been told of the spill and yet did nothing, choosing his meal over duty?\n\nThe law would not easily banish Jennifer Palmer’s claim to the shadows. For punitive damages to be just, one must show the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that might come, such conduct deemed despicable. Palmer would argue that Martin, the manager, should have known the danger of leaving the spill, for others had fallen before her in those very aisles. Despite this, he did not act. The argument that his actions were despicable is perhaps less strong, yet it holds some weight, for six slip-and-fall incidents scar the year 2009 alone, and still, Martin did not ensure the safety of his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, as the clock struck five, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with news of the spill. But Martin, deep in his dinner break, dismissed Wayne’s words like so much ash on the wind. A quarter-hour later, Mary J. Haddigan, another soldier of the store, brought the same news, and once again, Martin turned away. At half-past five, it was Jennifer Palmer who met the floor, her back taking the brunt of the fall. Five such incidents had been reported in that year before hers, and now Palmer seeks recompense from D&D for her pain, both compensatory and punitive, as we ponder the wisdom of seeking to cut short her pursuit of the latter.\n\nIn California, the path to punitive damages for a breach of duty not born of contract lies in proving “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So states Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, according to the statute, is harm intended, or if intent be absent, conduct deemed “despicable” carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” The courts have marked conduct as malicious if the defendant, aware of the probable danger his actions posed, willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something she needed. A longing that refused to find its rest. It began when she was about fourteen, stepping into the tangle of teenage life. And it lingered still three years later at seventeen. By now she had come to know it was someone she sought, not something. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had tried, stumbling through awkward gestures to charm the uncharmable, but none captured her fancy. She puzzled over this odd notion, sifting through the reasons that might explain such a strange occurrence in a girl of her age. The years of pondering had yielded theories, but none strong enough to hold her speculation. So she moved through life, the question of her desires ever present.\n\nA day at home was typically a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle, calm souls. They never quarreled with one another, and it was a rare thing to find any discord between them and their daughter. The only contention was her insistence on her independence and the free spirit she bore. A daughter to such a composed pair, she was nonetheless their opposite, her vibrant personality a counterpoint to their tranquility, yet she was well-loved for her kindness and the joy she brought.\n\nBut today was not a day of calm. As she moved from room to room, seeking some spark for her own musings, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen, her mother’s voice, usually so melodious, now strained. She rushed into the room, a thread of panic winding through her. \"Mom? Mom, what’s wrong?\" she cried. She found her mother on the floor, wincing, breath coming in short bursts as she muttered \"Ow\" with each exhalation. She dropped to her side, a hand reaching out to ease her. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to—the hospital.\" The words were pressed out, each one tight with pain. Her daughter, now the stalwart of the house, was thankful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital stood an edifice of disinfectant and dread, the air tinged with the tang of fear. But her mind was too occupied with the task at hand to notice. She bore her mother swiftly inside, calling for aid. Faces, furrowed with concern, gathered round as a bed on wheels was brought forth and her mother was eased onto it. They took her away to be seen to, leaving the daughter alone in her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a step stool, reaching for a vase that rested on the highest shelf they had.",
            "In the silence of the study, the light sifted through the blinds, casting long shadows across the pages of numbers and notes. This inquiry, like a lone rider on an endless plain, sought to uncover the ways of the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled but whispered of in the halls of medicine. Here, in the heart of the land, the aMed diet, a variant of its Mediterranean kin, called for a bounty of plants, their roots deep in the earth, and the sea’s own fish, while turning away from the flesh of beasts and the heavy fats they bore. Even the spirits were welcome, in modest measure, to join this dance of sustenance.\n\nThe records bore witness to tales of those who followed this diet, their risks of the grim fate of heart disease and stroke lessened, as if the diet were a shield against time's cruel hand. In the chronicles of past studies, the Med diet stood firm against the specter of death, its power proven more potent than the low-fat ways in the battle against the bulge and the war of the blood.\n\nThis tale unfolded over years, with 74,886 women, their lives a tapestry of health and habit, unwound through the careful lens of the Nurses' Health Study. From the year of 1984 to 2004, they walked this path, their steps recounted through the food frequency questionnaires, echoes of their daily bread. The faith of these women stood strong, with over 95 percent holding to their course across two decades. Their tales of heart and stroke were etched in records, each stroke and heart attack a line in the annals of medical lore.\n\nThe numbers were gathered, the aMed scores tallied, like the counting of stars in the night sky, to smooth the random and reveal the true path of their diet. Care was taken to clear the fog of confusion, adjusting for age and smoke and the many ways a life could tilt the scale.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the story of the aMed score unfolded, revealing the path to lesser risks of heart and stroke. In two decades, the toll was counted: 2391 hearts faltered, 1763 strokes struck, and 1077 fell to the great silence of cardiovascular disease. Yet, those who adhered most closely to the diet’s tenets found themselves at less risk, as if the diet bore them through the storm, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those who strayed.\n\nThus, the Mediterranean diet whispered its promise, a promise of life and health amidst a world of shadow and decay.",
            "The sign stood stark against the drab horizon, a message scrawled in black ink that held the weight of a world gone mad. Hitler alive in Burma, it read. The girl beneath the sign, Ellen Page, star of a film once bright with youthful promise, stood alone on that street corner. Her face was a mask of quiet resolve, the cardboard a thin shield against the apathy of passersby. Burma, that distant land, a country known in the tongues of men as Myanmar, lay under the iron grip of a junta. They had seized power in '62, a coup d'état, a bloodless word for a bloody act. \n\nIn '07, the streets awoke. A decade of silence shattered by the voices of monks clad in saffron robes, their protests a revolution named for the color that cloaked them. The Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, the monks were allowed their peace—an uneasy peace—but soon the streets ran red. The military came down like a hammer, monasteries ransacked, and those who bore witness, journalists from lands afar, were caged or killed. Kenji Nagai, a name lost to the dust of September 27th, his crime merely to be there, to see. The death toll, they said, was thirteen. A number whispered by those who knew better to be thousands. Colonel Hla Win, a defector, spoke of it—a truth drowned in silence.\n\nBut this was no new story. The dance of power and dissent as old as the stones beneath their feet. Rome had its gods, emperors who ruled by divine right. Japan, with emperors deemed gods themselves, leading with iron and ritual, their legacy a tapestry of technology and tradition. In America, the president, George W. Bush, conversed with Ted Haggard, a man of strange convictions, in a world where absurdity and policy walked hand in hand.\n\nTiananmen, '89—a protest, a massacre, the numbers a shadow play of truth and fiction, the dead uncounted, unremembered. Rwanda in the '90s, a genocide that stained the earth, the Hutu against the Tutsi, a history written in blood. Hitler's Reich, the Third, a dark chapter where the world looked away as millions perished. All these, echoes of a past that refuses to die, haunting the edges of a world forever teetering on the brink.",
            "In the dim and shadowed corridors of jazz there stood a man whose name was Duke and whose music lay like a tapestry woven in the dark. His life long and his creations longer still, for in his hands the orchestra became a living thing, a beast of sound and silence. At the heart of it all, the piano’s voice was soft, a whisper in the gathering storm, yet it was his mind that shaped the tempest. The compositions chosen here tell tales of his craft, where each note was a thread and each musician a color in the fabric. He laid down the paths where the soloists wandered, free as birds in the evening sky, and he drew them back again to the tight embrace of his orchestrations, each piece a testament to their style and his vision. The orchestra was his canvas, the sounds he conjured were like none other, fitting each piece like a glove to a hand, each sound a testament to the mastery of the man who knew the soul of each player and how they sang together in the growing choir of his dreams. \n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks his name and mentions Creole Love Call, where the voice becomes an instrument and words are but shadows. It was here that Duke first wove voice into the tapestry, a rich color without the burden of lyrics. The piece stands as a monument to his ability to match the voice of his soloists to the song’s soul. It unfolds in six choruses, each a step in its journey:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response that echoes like voices in a canyon, the voice smooth and then rough like the wind through the trees.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet weaves its tale, bending notes like reeds in the water.  \nChorus 3: A clarinet's cry high and sweet, with the piano's soft syncopation beneath it.  \nChorus 4: The band a reflection of the first chorus, brass and reeds answering each other.  \nChorus 5: The piece's heart, where the high reeds call and the brass and rhythm respond in syncopated time.  \nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, voice and reeds in their dance, the voice now growling like some wild thing.  \nTag: A fleeting moment, a vocal run, the trombone's dissonance a final note.\n\nVoice as color, as texture, a thread in the fabric of his work, this was but one of his many gifts. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, the Duke mixed tight orchestration with the hues of tone color. A call and response, “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet muted, Baby Cox’s scat singing, each borrowing from the other, each a shadow and a light. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart in Duke's orchestra, gives the melody voice on his muted trombone, an extension of the ideas that lay within the Duke’s mind, ever reaching, ever seeking, forever crafting the music of the night.",
            "In the vast theater of existence, one question lingers in the shadows: why do living things shape themselves the way they do? Does some unseen hand guide their transformation, shackled by chains of limitation? It was in 1917 when D’Arcy Thompson mused, as if whispering to the void, that the zoologist had not yet dared to speak the simplest forms of life in the language of numbers. And still, the echo of that thought remains. Yet, in the quiet corridors of recent times, the mathematicians have turned their gaze upon the humble mollusk, tracing the lines of its shell through time's passage, both its youth and its lineage, seeking to unravel the mysteries therein.\n\nOur study, like a lone wanderer in the desert, seeks to harness the power of mathematical modeling, to peer deep into the heart of Prunum, to understand the forces that shape its journey through the ages. We look at the bones, the very structure of these creatures, through the ghostly images cast by X-rays, and from these, we draw the lines and numbers that will tell us of their past and their possible futures. These numbers, these whispers of existence, feed the hungry mind of the software CerioShell, as if it were a beast of the machine, and from it, we conjure the forms that might yet be.\n\nA shell, you see, is a tube, a tunnel through the void of time, spiraling in endless circles, a helix of life. Each turn, each whorl, is a dance around a phantom spine, the columella, the pillar of its being. The speed of this dance, this eternal spiral, is marked by sutures, the scars of its journey. And the grandest of these turns is the final one, the body whorl, the culmination of its life's voyage. Above it, the spire, a crown of all that came before, reaching ever upwards. The apex, the pinnacle, and below, the base, the foundation. From the shell's heart, the creature emerges, through the aperture, the gateway to the world.\n\nWe peer at their forms from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a different tale. To count the whorls, to unravel this spiral, one must begin at the top, discerning the first suture, drawing the line that splits the shell's story in twain. And from there, count the whorls, precise to the quarter turn, tracing the arc of life.\n\nA shell's journey is a series of apertures, a path carved through space and time, as the creature builds its home. One can map this journey, chart the course of the aperture, through coordinates and radii, both horizontal and vertical. This path, this trajectory, can be drawn upon paper, captured in the language of mathematics. And with that language, with those numbers, we can alter the course, manipulate the very making of the mollusk's shell.",
            "In the waiting shadow of a decade, the numbers stood still, unyielding. Neonatal and infant mortality, unmoved in the vast archipelago of Indonesia. The nation strides forth, meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, water and sanitation within reach, yet the specter of maternal and child health looms large, the goals for 2015 slipping further into the horizon. Herein, the reasons lie scattered like fallen leaves, pointing to the frailty of the health system, a call to fortify its bones rather than chase after fleeting interventions.\n\nThere's been progress, they say. Seventy-two percent of births now find themselves under the watchful eyes of skilled hands. Yet those hands include the midwives, the wise women of the village, who hold no scalpel, who cannot ward off the shadow of a complicated birth. And so, the blood flows, and the mothers are lost. Deceptive, these numbers, masking the work yet to be done. Meanwhile, the healers for the children, those who mend the bellies of the young, seem fewer. The records of care after birth, fragments incomplete, tell a story of neglect, of low numbers across the land.\n\nThe cut that saves, the cesarean, is rare. Four percent, it whispers. Seven in the cities, but in the countryside, it is only two. The disparity speaks of a land divided, where the roads to health lie clustered in the city’s embrace. The poor, too, find themselves at the end of a long road. Twenty-seven percent separates the rich from the poor in the quest for care, the cost paid in coins and in lives.\n\nAs the future beckons, the path is unclear. How does one mend this broken tapestry of care? Does the solution lie in the silos of programs, or in the foundation of the system itself? The allure of programs is undeniable, their targets clear, their goals attainable. Yet the danger lies in their singular focus, for where one field flourishes, another withers. Resources drawn to the bright flame of funding leave others in shadow. Programs uncoordinated, services duplicated, a tangle of forms and paper trails, all whispering of a need unmet.\n\nAnd so, the question lingers in the heavy air: Where do we go from here?",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has swelled, its borders stretching to encircle a multitude of genres, each a testament to the human spirit's restless quest for expression. It is a labyrinthine world, where genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—mere whispers of names upon the wind—branch into countless sub and sub-sub genres, each a tributary to the great river of sound. Amongst these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands as a colossus, unmatched in its diversity and in the depth of its expression over these past forty years. It is a music of shadows and echoes, where the spectrum of emotion is broad yet often cast in somber hues. From its inception, Heavy Metal revealed a malleability, a capacity for variation that artists seized upon to craft new sub-genres, and from these, further branches sprouted, a tree ever-growing, its roots deep in the earth of time.\n\nIn this day, we find ourselves amidst a thicket of Heavy Metal's offshoots, each a niche unto itself, blurring the lines of what Heavy Metal truly is. It has become a mosaic, drawing in themes from distant musical lands, yet all journeys have a beginning. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the world today, one must first comprehend this movement—a force that transcends mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement carved from darkness. It is a symphony of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more spectacle. It is a testament to skill, where the musicians wield their instruments with a mastery that sings through the chaos. And yet, it is a movement steeped in the haze of substance, for the psychedelic tides of the mid-seventies washed over the creators, birthing works of otherworldly madness, with the drugs a convenient muse. Metal's heart is visceral, its soul a sonnet of the dark, a revelation to a musical landscape that had seldom dared tread such shadowed paths. The echoes of the Romantic Era's brooding cadences whisper through its veins. Lyrics, like those penned by Byrne, speak to the darkness that forms the bedrock of this movement.\n\nConsider Helter Skelter, where the Beatles ventured into the abyss. It is a dance of highs and lows, a reflection of a drug-laden odyssey. Some declare it among the first Heavy Metal songs, a retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into heaviness. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle, to show that they too could plumb the depths, and so they enshrined it within The White Album.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists began their dream-laden canvases, there stood Henri Rousseau, crafting dreams with the steady patience of a man laying bricks against the passage of time. The Dream, a painting from 1910, bore witness to his journey, a tableau of wonder and longing. There, a woman sat, eyes wide at the marvels unfolding around her in the landscape of her slumber. Yet it was not just her dream Rousseau painted; it was his own, a dream of being counted among the greats, of hearing his name spoken in reverence across the salons and galleries. In his heart, a war raged, a question hung over his art like a shadow: to echo the voices of others, to mold his brushstrokes to the forms of those deemed worthy by the critics, or to let his heart guide his hand, to paint with the rawness and truth of his own vision. The Dream stands like a stone marker at a crossroads, capturing the very essence of his battle, the choice between conformity and the wild, uncharted path of originality. \n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first pause and consider the man himself, Henri Rousseau, born in the spring of 1844 in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father was a man of modest means, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who tasted the comforts of bourgeois life. Rousseau, he did not come to art by way of academies or schools. His days were spent in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a keeper of tolls, though many would mistakenly dub him a douanier, a customs inspector. Life dealt him its blows—a wife lost, Clémence by name, and with her the lives of eight children who never saw the light of day. Only his daughter Julia remained, a living reminder of what was taken. In his sorrow, he turned to the canvas, seeking solace in the creation of something new. Unlike his contemporaries who painted tales of peasants with rose-tinted brushstrokes, Rousseau remained a folk painter at heart, his dreams and aspirations rooted in the soil of his class. \n\nIt was not surprising that Rousseau yearned for the approval of the art world. He was a man who came to painting without the pedigree of formal training, a novice who picked up his brushes later in life, surrounded by the luminaries of modern art who cast long shadows. Recognition was a slow river, and though he labored for years, it was only in the dawn of the new century that the world began to take notice, a time when Matisse was already carving out his legacy. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon wrote of them both, acknowledging a truth: while Matisse painted with the fear of falling into the mundane, Rousseau sought to paint the very picture that would unlock the gates to the Artiste Français, to be counted among their ranks.",
            "In the quiet of the world there lies a thread unbroken, a tie that binds the seen to the unseen, the truth to the beauty. Many have pondered this link that seems to defy the edges of knowing, a connection that whispers in the shadows of our existence. Keats, in his own way, has spoken of it, the urn bearing witness to a truth that is beauty and a beauty that is truth. In this world we wander, much of what we gather is through the lessons of the world and the harshness of experience. Yet there are things we seem to know without the learning, an innate understanding that speaks to us of ethics and aesthetics in ways beyond the teaching.\n\nThe essence of ethics and beauty, it seems, is not in the telling but in the showing. They are not prescriptions laid down in stone but whispers of understanding that skirt the edges of our comprehension. We do not seek to dictate what is good or fair but rather to unravel the why of it, to understand the grace of a painting or the righteousness of an act. Critics may speak of Mona Lisa’s mysteries in terms of light and shadow, of history and form, but the essence of her smile eludes them. When asked of our own heart’s favorite, we might stumble over words, saying only, “There’s something about it,” before the walls of explanation rise around us. Art and morality, both, resist the cages of description, standing as Flannery O’Connor put it, as stories that cannot be spoken in any other tongue. They whisper of a beyond, a transcendence that remains when the words have faded, a truth that stands alone.\n\nIn the quiet places of our hearts, ethics and art speak in voices not of this world. As Wittgenstein suggests, ethics cannot be caught in the trap of expression. They are the gleam off distant waters, the echo of a song we cannot quite remember. This nameless something, this je ne sais quoi, is the soul of art and morality, a power that lies in the spaces between words, in the unsaid and the unspoken.\n\nThe bond between morality and art is forged in the fires of the unseen, where the world touches the eternal. Literature, perhaps most of all, holds the weight of this truth. McKean speaks of its moral heart, of how it holds a mirror to life’s values, reflecting the principles that guide us through the darkness. In literature, as in life, we find the measure of what matters, the echo of our own souls in the written word. Here, in the pages of story, we see ourselves, and in seeing, we understand.",
            "In the expanse of shadows cast by the Alps down to the Baltic's restless edge lies a nation, stitched together from the sinews of time. Germany, a land forged in the crucible of history, where the echoes of ancient tribes still whisper in the wind that sweeps across the Rhine from Köln to the Elbe's Saxon banks in Dresden. This tapestry of culture, woven of many threads, draws from the roots of Germania, the ancestral soil.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost in the annals of time, stirs debates among the scholars who seek its origin. Tacitus, in the dim corridors of history, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe whose name was once German before they dared the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first penned \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars, a distinction born from the tongues of the Gauls to mark those unconquered beyond the river’s icy flow. The word's birth remains shrouded; some say it spoke of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, others of spears glinting in battle, or the clamor and cry that marked their presence (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC; O.E.D, 2010).\n\nIn the annals of Tacitus, penned in the year of our Lord AD 98, he spoke of the Germans, untamed and pure, their blood unmixed by the tide of migration. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"for in ancient times, it was not by land but by ship that those seeking new homes arrived. Who would forsake Asia, Africa, Italy for Germania's wild lands, its sky leaden, its manner grim, unless it was his birthplace?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWho indeed would leave the marble heart of Rome for the shadowed forests of Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions, seeking the spoils of these untamed lands. Yet, like the tide, they often receded to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging like specters in the first century's twilight, lingered on Rome's periphery, trading the land's bounty and lending their strength to the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, disguise serves as a cunning tool, one that can weave an intricate tapestry of deceit. Yet, it is a double-edged sword, for in its shadow lies the peril of losing oneself eternally. To end such a masquerade is to face the abyss of alienation. A choice must be made, between the preservation of self or the fragile bonds that tether one to others. And while some may greet revelation with indifference, others will not suffer such trickery lightly, their offense a testament to the charade's folly.\n\nThe matter of deception intertwined with the reversal of gender roles becomes a tangled skein, raising questions that gnaw at the soul. Chief among these is the query: why? What compels one to abandon their true self, donning the guise of another gender? Viola's path is one of necessity, a shield against a world of potential harm: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a land foreign and unknown, Viola finds her refuge in the semblance of manhood, a cloak against the wolves that might prowl. Yet, this guise isolates her from the sisterhood she might have known, severing the ties of feminine kinship. Her mimicry is so flawless that Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, succumbs to love's blind folly. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). And still, there lies the unspoken yearning between Viola and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo the discerning eye of the modern reader, Twelfth Night reveals how deception can unearth the buried truths of the heart, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The presence of Viola as Cesario forces these characters to confront desires long hidden in shadow. Does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from the appearance of manhood or does it betray an unspoken inclination towards women? Yet, one might argue otherwise, viewing Olivia as a satirical figure, a mirror reflecting those who judge solely by outward guise.\n\nHer swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her acceptance of Viola as kin rather than paramour—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—speaks to the caprice of her heart, shaped by the whims of sight alone.",
            "Under the indifferent sun of the colonial expanse, the German dominion was not a singular beast. It was a varied and multifaceted entity, brutal in some quarters and yet capable of nurturing, as the shifting sands of its territories attested. Like the distant echoes of a gunshot, the scars of its reign lingered most fiercely upon the Ovaherero and Nama, their fate sealed in the unforgiving deserts of German South West Africa. Yet, to paint the entire empire with the same brush is to overlook the discordant notes in its symphony of rule. \n\nIn the heart of Tanganyika, under the British eye in 1919, they unearthed a populace that spoke in the tongues of books and letters, a testament to the German hand that had once guided them. Kamerun, too, bore witness to the commendations of chroniclers who praised the educational endeavors of the Germans there. But in the barren stretches of South West Africa, the story differed. There, the mission of education for the native was a task abandoned to the missionaries, their palms open to the sky for whatever scant government blessing might fall their way. Meanwhile, the European youth basked in the structured embrace of state schools, the coffers opened wide for their enlightenment.\n\nThe legacy of this disparity rippled through time, leaving South West Africa adrift in a sea of ignorance, the people unlettered and voiceless. It was a consequence born of many threads—social, political, economic—all weaving a tapestry of neglect. This paper seeks to unravel those threads, to shine a light on the settlers and the rulers, to understand the weight of their gazes upon the native souls.\n\nIn the annals of history, penned mostly in the German tongue and inscribed during or just after the empire's fall, lies a wealth of knowledge on this colonial education. Early accounts sought merely to document, but later voices in English expanded the tale, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the intricacies of each colony's approach to learning. Among these, Cohen stands prominent, dissecting the educational pathways of South West Africa alongside its eastern counterpart. His findings trace the roots of divergence to the settler masses who called South West Africa home, their presence shaping the schools that rose from the dust.\n\nIn South West Africa, the land was kinder, its climate temperate despite the desert's reach. This drew Europeans to its bosom, nearly fifteen thousand by 1913, standing in stark contrast to the more modest gathering in East Africa. Thus, the story of education in the German colonial empire is one of contrasts, of lands and peoples, of intentions and outcomes, each chapter written in the ink of its own circumstances.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stood as two nations entwined in a rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the close of 1893. At the heart of this struggle was the Mexican-American War, a conflict waged between 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in an act of conquest, seized from Mexico the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new territories. This was but the peak of many confrontations that would echo between the two until the eve of the Great War.\n\nThis tale of rivalry is not unlike that of other nations who share their borders, for the earth is carved with lines that separate and yet bind. Nations that are neighbors often find themselves in the throes of conflict, their interests clashing like waves against the shore. As Pletcher once noted, the United States found its most enduring diplomatic trials with Mexico and Cuba, while other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations.\n\nReligion, too, played its part, as it has in the stories of many lands. It was a rift as old as the hills, borne from the suspicion between the English and the Spanish, a distrust passed down from their colonial forebears. Frahm wrote of this, likening it to the ideological struggles of later years, where the United States stood opposed to the specters of fascism and communism, yet in those earlier times, it was against Catholicism and monarchy that they railed. Thus, the seeds of discord were sown, hindering the path to peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts, those chroniclers of old, counted seventeen disputes between these nations during their half-century of rivalry, most of them over the lands they bordered. Bandits and outlaws traversed these lines, causing strife until both nations marshaled their forces to quell the unrest.\n\nBut time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt speaks of the shift in the winds, as Mexico found itself leaning upon the United States, its ambitions no longer for land but for the wealth within. Thus did the fires of rivalry cool, and a new era dawned on the horizon.",
            "Fifteen years past, an affliction unknown and unbidden laid me low, a shadow come to steal the light from my days. I had been a nurse, sworn to the call of healing, drawn to it by the deep-seated yearning for a safety and security that had eluded my childhood. The words echoing like a chant in the halls of memory—\"Work will always be there; the sick will always need tending.\" These words shaped my path, though the heart held dreams of science and the ink of journalism, a blend of the two perhaps. Yet it was nursing I chose.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, unmoored, single, pockets near empty, and the work denied me. Disabled still, these fifteen years on, living by the grace of Social Security’s mercy, with naught to claim as my own. Life’s course a constant struggle, a siege upon the bastions of security and self-worth. Certainty, that old companion, now a ghost. Yet through it all, one truth stands immutable: without the kindness of kin and the steadfastness of friends, these years would have been insurmountable, no matter the strength I fancied I possessed. For when calamity comes, it strips bare the illusion of strength.\n\nLife holds its calamities, the small and the vast. No certainties, no assurances stand unbroken, and preparation, though it girds us well, cannot alone conquer the immense. I find myself in accord with the notion that we mustn't place our trust solely in the crumbling edifice of government. Yet I hold dear the belief that we must rekindle the trust amongst ourselves, learn once more the art of giving aid and seeking it, rather than retreating to solitude, building bunkers against the world.\n\nThis talk of rugged individualism, the mythic backbone of this land, but truth lies elsewhere. It was compassion and shared burdens that sustained our forebears through the lean times, not solitary striving. The wagon trains that braved the Rockies to the far coast did not travel in isolation.\n\nSo yes, prepare as you must. I am ready. A kit of necessities, a balm against disaster. Supplies for wounds, tablets to make water pure, plastic and tape to seal against unseen threats. Flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches to light the dark. Canned goods to stave off hunger. If land is yours, and the means to farm it, to preserve its bounty, then do so. A wood stove is a wise companion, though perhaps not for those in lofty dwellings.\n\nBut remember, in your preparations, to know your neighbors.",
            "In a time long past, in the dusked corridors of history, there came into being a prince whose path would wind through the world and away from it, toward enlightenment, and in the telling he would be known as Buddha. In such manner did the teachings rise, like smoke from a distant fire, and they would bear the shape of Buddhism, rooted in the ancient earth yet reaching ever upward. Among its branches, there is one most true, called Theravada. The faith breathes the air of some twenty-five centuries, and time has carved it differently from the days when the Buddha walked beneath the sky. It manifests in places like Sri Lanka, where men of robes and men of toil partake in the waters' annual communion, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such rites. These shifts run deep, from the surface of ritual down to the marrow of salvation. And so the Theravada way, in its cloisters and in its homes, has learned to bend beneath forces, both from within and without, both harsh and indifferent.\n\nTerms must be drawn here like lines in the sand. The internal and the external, these are the first. Internal, born of those who walk the path of the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the yellow robes or not. External, the winds that blow from the lands of other faiths. Hostile forces are those that strike at the heart, wishing ill or casting shadows on the Buddhist soul. Benign forces pass like clouds, neither to aid nor to hinder, yet their shadows may cool or darken all the same. These will be our compass as we seek to understand.\n\nTo begin, one must look to the heart of the faith, the doctrines that burn like a steady flame in the night. Refuge is sought in the triple gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, bound in the Tripitaka, the baskets that hold the teachings. The Sutta Pitaka, with its words like rivers. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules that bind. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, the thoughts that roam the sky. Metaphysics speaks of Anatta, the void of self; Dukkha, the sorrow stitched into life's fabric; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Only in seeing these can one step off the wheel, the unending turn of death and rebirth, the great Sansara. And with its end, desire and hatred and delusion shall fall away, a lightening of the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the path of conduct. Five precepts for the layman: to kill not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not, to drink not. For the monks, the rules are many and strict. At the center of all, the four noble truths stand like sentinels. Dukkha, the world’s sorrow. The chain of suffering, forged by attachment. And the promise that the chain can be broken."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast expanse of human dealings, culture casts its shadow long and deep. It is defined as much by its absences as by its presence, a specter of many forms. It is neither a monolith nor a singular path. To say all Russians stand immovable or all Japanese yield with ease is to paint with a brush too broad, a canvas too simple. In the heart of negotiation, the keen eye sees beyond the veneer of generalities, seeking the pulse of what a culture truly means to the dance of discourse. When a foreign culture beckons, it is measured against the yardstick of one's own land, and the mind grapples with echoes and reflections.\n\nTo delve into the heart of another culture is to wander through its history, to touch the edges of its biases. Judgment and change are not companions here. Acceptance holds the key, especially when the winds of negotiation blow cold against one's back. In foreign lands, the recognition of customs, the homage to beliefs, can bridge the chasm of difference, nudging the talks forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach does not end at borders drawn upon maps. Within the walls of corporations, a culture all its own takes root. Some demand the sacrifice of hours upon the altar of work, while others embrace a gentler pace. It shows itself in the garments of workers, in the words they choose, in the ways tasks are parceled out. Some firms call upon their kin to give freely, while others bind such acts to sanctioned causes. The American corporate landscape, diverse as its wide plains and bustling cities, is testament to the myriad ways culture breathes life into the notion of work. In lands less fractured, cultures may seem more whole, but beneath that surface lies depth waiting to be unearthed.\n\nIn the end, it is the values that speak the loudest, whispering the reasons why a culture moves as it does. To save face, to hold dear the harmony of the many—such are the tokens that guide a negotiator's hand. A soul from a land where bargains are battles will not yield easily, nor rush to closure. These truths must be carried close, before the table is set and the dance commences. Yet, wisdom lies in knowing the soul across the table, for in their story lies the path to a negotiation well met.",
            "In the quiet of an ancient text, the fool's heart whispers there is no God. Psalm 14, the old scripture, speaks first this thought, and St. Anselm takes it up in his quest for proof of the divine. This belief, shared by the likes of Thomas Aquinas, stands as a citadel in their writings on God's existence. Our task, to weigh which argument holds the greater truth, must begin with a quiet assumption. We shall assume they are both right in their belief, in the God of the Bible, for to entertain a different God would unravel the tapestry of their arguments, leaving us with threads instead of a whole cloth. Yet, in this quiet meditation, I suggest that neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a complete path to belief.\n\nLet us first walk with St. Anselm, whose steps trace a journey of faith. He turns inward, gazing at the soul's landscape, where he finds God etched into the mind’s corners. Anselm speaks of a God whose presence is so deeply woven into our understanding that to imagine otherwise is folly. His words, dense and labyrinthine, tell of a proof that rests not in the world but within the soul's quiet knowing. He invites us to see that the truth of God is not found in the world's clamor but in the silent certainties of the mind. This is faith, the Christian texts say, the acceptance of truths unseen, unproven by the world outside.\n\nContrast this with St. Thomas Aquinas, who stands on the firm ground of reason. To him, God is a truth born of logic and observation, no faith required. His method, a boon to the evangelist, for it builds a bridge of reason to the unconverted, needing no leap into the unseen. Aquinas lays out five paths of reason: the change, the cause, the contingent, the degrees of excellence, and the harmony. Each is a step that shows God as a necessity of logic, a puzzle piece unseen yet whose outline is clear in the picture it completes. Thus, the discourse unfolds, each man offering a different road, yet both leading to the same unseen city.",
            "In the world of letters, authors weave their words with the skill of craftsmen, each turn of phrase coaxing from the page a certain spirit, a certain manner by which we come to know the tale they tell. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he among them, employs such craft in his telling of The Great Gatsby. He conjures images with an unusual marriage of words, pairing the unexpected with the familiar, casting a spell over the reader, an atmosphere suspended in delicate balance. He draws upon the essence of symbols, colors chief among them, to breathe life into the narrative. Gold and green, white and gray, red and pink—each shade is a thread in the tapestry of his world. Their meanings, like whispers on the wind, are built carefully, layer upon layer, until they resonate with the reader's soul.\n\nThe colors white and gray bear a weight of meaning under Fitzgerald's hand, a quiet uniformity, white with its veneer of class, gray with its whispers of time's passage. We see this from the outset as these shades cloak the characters and their world. Daisy and Jordan, always in white—Nick too, in his white flannels at Gatsby's revels, Tom in his white shirt beside Myrtle, and Catherine, powdered milky white. The halls of Gatsby's dwelling, a riot of colors, stand apart, marking a departure from this palette. These hues, white and gray, paint the cityscape and its people—Nick descending amidst the white chasms of New York, the names of Gatsby's guests now gray upon Nick's ledger, Catherine’s home, a white cake of apartments. The world itself is streaked with these colors—Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray cars and gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child's grayness, the gray old man selling dogs.\n\nFitzgerald, thus, arms these colors with the power to denote insignificance, a sameness that envelops certain figures in the tale. Daisy, clad in white, seated in her white roadster, becomes less a person, more an ideal, a thing Gatsby covets. She is the gray haze on a fur collar, the white dress before the duel of words between Tom and Gatsby. Through these hues, Fitzgerald crafts a vision of Daisy as less substance, more shadow, an echo of longing in the heart of a man.",
            "In the mild embrace of San Diego's unyielding sun, the land lays forth its bounty. Tomatoes and citrus fruits, greens of the field, the tender hearts of squash, and the dark crowns of broccoli all find their place in this fertile soil. There too are the herbs, the trees heavy with peaches and lemons, the berries ripening in the light, and honey and peppers, each one a testament to the earth's generosity. There is a hunger here for the pure, the organic, and the earth answers with sustenance. The people wait, their names inscribed upon lists, yearning for the harvest of these lands. Eggs and milk, untouched by the hand of man, flow from these fields to the tables. Upon these farms, life is not merely cultivated but observed, as birds take to the sky and the feet of wanderers tread the paths offered. Here is a place where the landowner might harness the gifts of man’s governance, not just to reap but to preserve, to educate, and to prosper.  \n\nAmidst this bounty, the land speaks of another kind of wealth, one not measured in coin but in life itself. The organic way offers a sanctuary for wild things, for plants and creatures, safe from the taint of chemicals. Yet, it asks a price. The labor is hard, the toil unending. The war against weeds and pests is fought without the familiar weapons, the soil is fed without the ease of synthetics, and the harvest is less certain. The small farm lacks the might of its larger kin, the efficiency that comes with scale. To walk the path of the organic farmer is to embrace the burden of the earth itself, to plant and graze, to remove what does not belong, to shape the land for the life that calls it home. And so, the landowner might seek counsel and assistance, to balance the scales of profit and preservation.\n\nIn this tale, the land rests beside the town of Potrero, in the wilds of San Diego County where the Cleveland National Forest stands as a guardian. It is 160 acres of chaparral and grassland, of oak woodlands whispering to the skies. Here, the ecoregion tells its own story, part of a grand plan to safeguard the lives of many, plants and beasts alike. The land remembers those who came before, the Native Americans who knew its song, and the settlers who sought its promise. This land, once a homestead, where cattle grazed and wood was hewn, now stands at the crossroads of past and future. \n\nI chose this land from the offerings of the modern world and sought to understand what aid might come to one who wishes to farm it in harmony with nature. In doing so, I found a farm nearby, a model of what might be, a place where the earth's voice is heard, and its gifts are given.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, a bond unyielding and beyond recall. Within this tether lie emotions manifold: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, each an ember in the fire of kinship. Brothers, bound by blood, see in one another a mirror of themselves, a reflection clearer than any other bond might conjure. It is when the world turns dire and shadows lengthen that this bond’s true nature reveals itself, be it light or dark. Such revelations come at a cost, their toll exacted in the currency of consequence. To know the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the price they demand. When a brother looks upon his kin and sees his own visage, it is not as the world sees him, but as he is, unadorned. In the deeds done and the echoes they leave behind, therein lies the heart of their character. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers walk the edge of this theme, where emotions rage and swirl like storms. Through a landscape lush and vividly wrought, they embark on a journey destined for ruin. Bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in the tale’s crescendo, and only one brother emerges from the tempest alive. The theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and their shared moments, all seen through the narrator’s eyes, which cast light upon the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his view of the world, both shaping his every act.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist’s deeds lies a singular emotion: pride. From the first steps they take together to their final, fatal trek, he harbors a quiet resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother, one to whom he might impart his worldly skills, the arts of breath-holding, running, leaping, climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with in the high forks of the great pine behind the barn. Yet, these dreams lay shattered, for Doodle was born frail of heart, the specter of death a constant companion, his body ill-suited for the rigors of boyhood fancy. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, whose head teemed with wild imaginings, to find his visions dashed. In his heart, anger stirred, a dark contemplation of ending the small life with a pillow's soft suffocation. What child, in the innocence of youth, might harbor thoughts of such finality? But then, a smile from the small one, a simple curve of lips, and hope unfurls in the protagonist’s heart. This fleeting act reveals that his resolve was not as steel. In the recesses of his mind, love for his brother lay, quiet and instinctive, waiting to be called forth.",
            "In the vast and tangled architecture of the human mind lies a complexity crafted through the ages. Like the deep and ancient forests that once knew only the whisper of the wind, so too has the understanding of the brain evolved from crude beginnings to something more like the precision of a machine. We once likened it to a wax tablet, then to the papyrus scrolls of lost civilizations, and in the march of time, we saw it as a book, and now speak of it as a computer. Yet even these metaphors fall short, like shadows that slip between the fingers, cautioning us against the folly of easy conclusions.\n\nThe journey of thought begins with the senses, those primal gateways that capture the world in all its rawness. The touch, the warmth, the sound that echoes through the empty halls of the universe, the light that falls like a benediction—each is transformed into the secret language of the brain, a code of electrochemical whispers. Here, the brain performs its dance, spinning this raw data with algorithms both simple and profound, weaving it into a tapestry of understanding. In the act of seeing a black box upon a field of white, the mind gathers the simplest truths—color, shape, the sharpness of an edge—and from these, the image is built in the mind's eye. The mind, always a step ahead, uses its top-down wisdom to see not just a shape but a box, not a void but a presence.\n\nYet as the threads of thought are spun, there is a filter that stands sentinel, discerning what is worthy of the mind's full embrace. In the chaos of green blades beneath one’s feet, the mind sees only what it must, turning away from the countless distractions of the world. Yet even in a room awash with noise, a name can pierce the din like a needle through cloth. At each juncture, the mind's attention shapes the form of understanding.\n\nMemory, the keeper of the past, holds the key to the brain's processing. Here, the moments of life are encoded, stored, and maintained within the mind's labyrinth. In the flicker of an instant, sensory memory captures the world. Working memory, ephemeral as the morning mist, holds its charge in the brief dance of electricity among neurons. Long-term memory, like ancient stones, is enshrined in the proteins that endure. Theories abound, each a map of the mind’s hidden geography. Some speak of networks and nodes, a web of connections that links ideas like stars in the night sky, where 'chair' finds kinship with 'table' and both to the living wood from which they were wrought.\n\nIn all this, we seek to understand the unknowable, to map the vast and silent corridors of the mind. And yet, for all our knowing, we remain as pilgrims on a road without end.",
            "In the year 2007, a shadow fell across the land of America. A financial tempest, unseen and unrestrained, spread its ruinous breath over the fortunes of men. Unemployment rose like some specter at the feast, the housing market a shambles, and the great engines of commerce lay broken in the dust. A recession took root and grew in that fertile desolation. And so we ask, how did it come to pass, and by what means might it be undone? The crisis was wrought by the folly of ambition, by the clumsy hands of governance that turned the wheels of finance until they spun themselves to the brink. Banks and firms, coaxed and cajoled, issued loans unfit for the soil they were planted in. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of underwriting, repackaged these mortgages into things unholy. With the borrowers fallen, the banks found their coffers bare, and so the contagion spread, a fire in the dry grasses, consuming all.\n\nIt began long before, in the year 1999, when the President sought to secure his place at the helm for another season. His administration, eager and heedless, loosened the bindings on lending, setting the stage for calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of such things, a Cassandra to deaf ears. Fannie Mae, he wrote, was under the thumb of the Clinton administration, urged to extend its reach into the lower echelons of income, to feed the maw of growth. Ill winds, he foretold, would bring ruin in their wake, and so they did. The script was writ and the actors took their places.\n\nThe economy was a great ship, and its course was altered by many hands. Mortgages, once simple, had grown into beasts of complexity. Adjustable rates and securities backed by the fragile promise of payment. Collateralized debt like the chains of an ancient slave, binding one sector to another. The nation’s households, its markets, all lay overleveraged upon the altar of housing. A bubble swelled and burst, and the financial institutions, those pillars of trade, were laid low. Trillions in mortgage debts, a sum beyond reckoning, weighed upon them. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch fell to the hammer of necessity, Lehman Brothers scattered to the winds, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley remade themselves under the stern gaze of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with debts towering, were taken into the fold of government, a ward against their own collapse.",
            "In the quiet reaches of your tale, where the words stretch out like a desert, lies exposition. It waits, a beast of burden, to carry forth your narrative and yet it might just as likely lay your readers low, lost to dreams or the back button, shaking curses at your name as they retreat. Dr. Merlin, a soul not unfamiliar with the art of storytelling, has been heard to cast her ire at screens when ensnared in the coils of excessive discourse, and not the kind that warms the heart.\n\nExposition, this is not your ally.\n\nMy readers, those gentle souls, have heard the age-old counsel, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in passages where the world stands still or spins out of control. Exposition, that devil perched on your shoulder, whispers of history to be told, urging you to lay it bare before the tale can unfold to its true form. Do not confuse it with the other imp, urging you to recount every detail of each character's past from cradle to grave.\n\nExposition means recounting the past, often in simple prose. In the realm of film, it is the moment where one soul turns to another and spills forth the ballast of the tale like the mariner of old. In fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nConsider this: within the weave of a story, the heroine finds her love, the union is celebrated with grand flourish, and yet he meets his end before her very eyes—this all told in a page or two, their words few and far between. Yet you would expect more of the husband, to see in him through speech and manner the depth of his love. Equally, you would hope to glimpse in her gestures the changes wrought by his presence, the light he cast upon her world. Such would draw you into their lives, their bond, and their loss, binding you to the heroine in her grief.\n\nIn essence, you seek the flesh upon the skeletal tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must weave that flesh. There is the urge to hasten past it all. Perhaps you're sketching a new figure—a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman in his heart, dreaming one day to own that very station, the taste of Eggs Benedict still on his tongue.",
            "In the flickering light of morning, the day's first news from Columbus broke like a distant storm, unbidden and raw. The voice spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, a name now etched in the annals of violence for the stabbing of his wife. The screen flickered with his visage, a face that seemed carved from some dark stone, malevolent and unyielding. Yet, the tale was brief, a mere wisp of time devoted to its unfolding, as if the gravity of the act was yet to settle upon the world.\n\nThe morning's second tale emerged like a shadow, the story of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, struck down in the Sharon Woods as the dawn struggled to break. Critically wounded, nameless in the chaos, with no hand held accountable. The SWAT team prowled the edges of this mystery, but the story itself seemed to pass like a ghost in the early air. The specter of neglect hovered there, a familiar refrain where the blood of minorities often fades too swiftly from the public eye. If it were another child, one of lighter skin, the clamor would rise to the heavens. Yet here, the silence was palpable.\n\nThen came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, pierced by a bullet's whisper, the place of its wounding unknown. A .22 caliber rifle, the voice said, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of reward, a sum of five thousand for the soul who might bring justice to bear. But this too was fleeting, a mere moment in the continuum of the broadcast.\n\nThe sky threatened rain, the forecasters spoke, and storms were promised for the afternoon, a brief interlude of tempests amid the heat of the weekend. Such was the brevity of this tale, a lure to hold the listener's ear.\n\nThe tale of the Clime Road UDF robbery followed, the description of a man cloaked in shadow, a dark-skinned black man swathed in a hoodie. The words lingered over his complexion, a curious fixation upon his shade as if the darkness itself was a part of the crime.\n\nLastly, there came the story of Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in hushed tones, a kingpin of drugs from the sun-hardened plains of Texas. A conspiracy laid bare, marijuana flowing northward to Ohio. The sentence was spoken in months, three hundred of them, as if to stretch the years into eternity. The fact of his Hispanic heritage was mentioned, an extraneous detail, perhaps, yet there it was, woven into the fabric of the story like a thread of shadow.\n\nAnd so, the day wore on, each tale a fragment of the world, echoing into the silence beyond the screen.",
            "In the world of financial instruments, an ETF—known as an exchange traded fund—moves like a shadow in the market, tethered to the pulse of an index or perhaps a commodity, or a collection of assets as an index fund might, yet it bears the nimbleness of a stock. It offers the broad horizon of an index while granting the focused power of a single stock—a means to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim as little as a singular share in any given transaction. Such enticements draw many to them, yet ETFs whisper of lower expense ratios than the common mutual fund. The path is not without its thorns, for to tread in the realm of ETFs is to pay a commission each time, akin to any stock venture. Yet the landscape is vast, with a multitude of funds to choose from. Despite these clear enticements, the prudent investor must always discern if the promised spread of diversification truly exists and to what extent, like a prospector sifting through sand for gold. \n\nTo this end, we cast our gaze upon ETF IHF, examining it against the top ten holdings within its confines, seeking to ascertain if the fruits of a singular ETF can mirror the bounty of owning a scattered portfolio of those ten stocks, or if another configuration might yield a sharper ratio or greater return. Yet to avoid the cumbersome task of considering each holding, we shall limit ourselves to the foremost ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below, the top ten holdings stand, each with its share of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these stocks stand as a reflection of the ETF IHF, we turn to the current percentage of assets, recalibrated to a full hundred, to measure each stock's weight in the portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were solely these ten stocks, each in the proportion ordained by their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the table below.\n\nFrom this table, it becomes clear: a portfolio of just these top ten holdings brings forth a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a rise of 16% in gains. A further revelation shows the Beta of these ten holdings sits .12 beneath that of the ETF entire. Thus, it appears that a portfolio crafted from these top ten might deliver higher returns at a lower beta. Yet, shadows remain, for these portfolios might not differ statistically in their means.\n\nTo discern this mystery, we delve into the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, recalibrated to a full hundred, to weigh their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "The days turned cold and the sun cast a weary light over the campus in that New England clime. With winter's grasp, the numbers fell away, those commuter logs dwindling like leaves from the trees. It was as if the very spirit of the venture had fled. Folks, wrapped in their old coats and scarves, trudged through December, their thoughts elsewhere. The semester's end loomed like a heavy curtain, and the minds of men and women were consumed with tasks that bore them down. The logs, neglected, faded from view, lost amid the noise of closing books and ringing bells. Holidays arrived with their own demands, and the campus lay silent, a ghost of its former self. \n\nJanuary returned with its promise of new beginnings, but the cold yet held sway, and the logs remained few. February came and went, a mystery unsolved, like tracks in the snow that lead nowhere. The initial fervor had passed, leaving only the quiet echo of what once was. March brought with it a challenge, a call to arms—Carpool Week, they named it—a final attempt to stir the embers, to coax life back into the forgotten cause. And for a time, it seemed to work. Yet the struggle was ever present, the battle against the lull of holidays and the rhythm of the academic year.\n\nIn truth, the heart of the matter lay deeper still. The open road had a hold on them, the freedom of the wheel and the solitude of a car’s cabin. It was a part of who they were, ingrained in their very bones. To lure them away required more than just good intention. Prizes were given, tokens of gratitude for those who took the road less traveled. But the prizes themselves were humble, perhaps too much so. The thought lingered of what might have been, a bicycle or an electric car, something grand to draw them in. Had the stakes risen with each passing month, perhaps the story would have unfolded differently. Yet, as it stood, the gifts remained small, and the numbers told their tale. The path forward lay uncertain, like a road disappearing into the mist.",
            "In the dim archives of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I found myself drawn to the flickering remnants of early Edison films. I resolved to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, those fifteen pieces spun between 1895 and 1901, each a testament to the nascent art of illusion born from the silent frames of celluloid. These films, with their beguiling craft, leaned upon the sleight of hand that clever editing could conjure. My study was a quiet unraveling of the poetics that defined most of these trick films, and a probing glance at those few among them that stood apart in their evolutionary stride, daring to breach the constraints of their era. \n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, bound to its place, framed within the rigid proscenium like a prisoner in a cell. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, would not shift its gaze to follow the players upon the stage. The choreography was borrowed from the theater, an echo of vaudeville and the conjurer’s art. Movement was confined to the narrow line between the wings, never toward or away from the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, circa 1900, where figures drift across the frame from right to left, never venturing into the depth of the scene. Even as they fade from view, the camera remains oblivious, anchored to its post.\n\nThe proscenium style cast its spell over the composition, dictating that all shots were long, and at times, medium. Close-ups were absent, unseen in the early Edison catalog, for the tradition was born of the theater where a spectator embraced the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's limits. Actors were stranded in the middle ground, distant from the lens, and thus, the intimacy of close-up was a stranger to these early frames.\n\nIn the infancy of the trick film, it was customary that a single shot would encompass the entirety of a film’s vision. The narrative was a fleeting wisp, constrained to mere seconds, dictated by the relentless ticking of the frames. Stories were sparse, mere whispers of vaudeville trickery—magic acts, disappearing acts—devoid of tale or drama. Yet, within this constraint lay a subtle deceit. The illusion of a singular shot belied the hidden seams where frames were stitched together to conjure apparitions or vanishing acts. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from the year 1895. Look closely, and the ruse reveals itself—the moment where Mary’s severed “head” joins the physical reel, though to the eye of the beholder, it remains a single unbroken vision.",
            "In those days when the Gothic novel found its first breath, it was as if the old world had birthed something new and strange, an odd marriage of contradictions. Ian Watt spoke of it, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his musings on the birth of this peculiar genre. It was both dismissed and exalted, this mode of writing, spoken of with disdain for lack of depth and yet revered for the 'terrible sublime' it seemed to conjure, as Burke might have noted. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto was the harbinger, binding the ancient with the modern, forging a path for those who would follow. In it, he took the old theatrical ways and wove them with the mimicry of nature that marked the novels of his time, creating what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe Gothic form was a refuge for relics of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. Even as Walpole penned his tale, the word \"gothic\" was a mutable thing, a descriptor that had been thrown at various peoples, styles, and ages, seen as something archaic and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modern progress. Yet this melding of the theatrical with the novel form, which let a reader peer into the minds of characters, gave the Gothic its longevity, making it a relic and a revelation at once to readers long removed from its origin.\n\nAmong the Gothic's echoes was the notion of Chivalry, that ancient code of the knight, a concept both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held weight for the Gothic scribes for what it symbolized—the knight of old, brave and true—and against the perceived decay of such ideals in the society they knew. The chivalric became romanticized, a glimpse backward to guide the present, perhaps even foreshadowing the Romantic to come. Walpole, writing in troubled times, saw shadows in the future and perhaps lamented a loss of virtue among his contemporaries. In his story, Frederic stands as a figure shaped by these ideals. Before Frederic steps forth, his presence is felt, a prince of chivalry, marred by tragedy and believed felled by infidels. He looms as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" exaggerated in form, foreshadowing the Gothic's love of excess. The characters breathe this chivalric air, and in them, Walpole's longing for an ideal lost is made manifest.",
            "In the quiet backwaters of commerce, the lifeblood of trade flows unseen from the moment a customer's need takes shape to the time it becomes a tangible reality. This procession, known as supply chain management, weaves its way through raw beginnings, through the sinews of supply, through the heart of production, and outward to the wide world of distribution. It was in the year 1982 that Keith Oliver, a man with the eyes of a seer and the mind of a tactician, gave this journey a name, a framework upon which the needs of man might be met with speed and precision. He spoke of it as a grand orchestration, a series of steps to be laid down with care and foresight.\n\nSix pillars uphold this structure, each as vital as the next: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools with which the stewards of industry craft their promises to the waiting world.\n\nIt begins with production, the genesis of all that follows. Here, the questions of when and why, of where and how, find their answers. Managers, like watchful shepherds, must discern the desires of their flock. The market, in its ceaseless ebb and flow, whispers its secrets to those who listen. With understanding comes decision, the what and the how many, the where and the which. The place of creation must be chosen with an eye to both the quantity and the quality demanded by those who wait. Schedules must be woven with the threads of time, and the machines made ready for their relentless toil. In this dance of creation, every step is crucial, for any misstep may squander both time and treasure.\n\nI have seen this with my own eyes, in the vast halls of Wal-Mart and Target. There, every aspect of the enterprise is set down, a script for the actors in this grand performance. From the attire of the laborer to the receipt of goods from distant lands, all is ordered, all is known. Such clarity breeds efficiency, and through it, the gears of business turn without the friction of uncertainty.\n\nNext comes supply, the lifeline upon which the success of all rests. It is a realm of choices, of which capabilities to nurture and which to entrust to others. A single product may have many paths to its creation, each with its own tools and hands, its own artistry. The manager, with the wisdom of Solomon, must choose the path that best serves the whole. And sometimes, the path leads outward, to partners beyond the walls of the company. This is done for the sake of speed, of velocity, the alchemy that turns quality into affordability, that renders the impossible possible.\n\nThese are the elements, the bones upon which the flesh of commerce is hung. And in their proper alignment, they carry forth the promise of fulfillment to the waiting world.",
            "The Victorian novels, with their meticulous attention to the minutiae of life and their devotion to the tales of the aristocracy, stand as monuments to an age now faded. Yet within this tapestry of gilded words, two stories emerge that diverge from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These tales, shrouded in mystery and tinged with the bizarre, reach beyond the conventional, drawing forth the very essence of their characters and laying bare the motives and emotions that drive them.\n\nAn uneasy consciousness shadowed Oliver, a specter of pain and fear that never ceased its torment. He walked as if in a dream, caught between the harsh voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words echoing in his mind. The sudden crack of gunfire jarred him, and he was swept away by unseen hands, lost in a tumult of cries and shouts, lights flaring before his eyes—a cacophony of chaos that blurred the lines of reality. In these visions, his powerlessness was laid bare, his senses dulled, his fate not his own. The shooting, a specter relived in his dreams, underscored his lack of control, his life teetering on the brink, held in the grip of forces beyond his ken. The hand of old Fagin, ever-present, seemed to tighten its hold, bending Oliver's will to despair, a slow breaking of spirit that left him unable to muster even the faintest resistance.\n\nThe day slipped away, a fleeting ghost swallowed by night, a night stretched thin with silence yet swift in its passing. Time, elusive and intangible, flowed through the dark hours, leaving behind only the residue of dreams and the shadows of what might have been.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the company of children, guiding them through the tangled thickets of learning. It was an after-school program, a place where young minds grappled with the lessons of the day. My hands were strongest in the realms of English and reading, and it was there I was called upon to aid a boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps in the third or fourth grade, and he struggled mightily with the written word.\n\nThere was something amiss, I knew. The boy could speak as well as any, yet when it came to the letters on the page, he faltered. Some letters he could sound out clear as a bell, others eluded him entirely. It was a curious thing. Adrian was of Latino descent, that much was plain, but his English was flawless. We stumbled along together until the day his mother appeared. \n\nI was minding a few stragglers while the others ventured on a field trip when she walked in. Adrian’s mother spoke not a word of English, her tongue Spanish alone. With my halting Spanish, we managed a conversation of sorts. And then it struck me, like a sudden clap of thunder: Adrian's trouble lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet itself. It was a revelation, and whether it helped him then I cannot say, but I hold a hope that he fares better now.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the language barriers that rise like great walls in our schools, here in California and beyond. It is not always as it seems, this obstacle of language. Even a child who speaks English with ease may find its written form an immense challenge. So what path do we walk to remedy this? In Adrian’s case, a simple tutoring of letters and sounds sufficed. But for those who speak little English, the way is more convoluted. There is no single remedy. A blend of methods—dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—each plays its part.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for those whose native tongue is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this idea, a fear that it squanders resources, that most children gain nothing. But this is false. Were we to make such programs the rule rather than the exception, all would benefit. But how to achieve this? Demanding all teachers be bilingual is a step too far, a dream too distant. Yet, there is no reason we cannot employ aides or tutors who are, to guide this journey.",
            "From the time we draw breath, we are told of things larger than ourselves, of vastness beyond grasp, of mysteries that lace the world like shadows in the night. We are sent to learn of these things in places of worship or introspection, to seek answers that others have sought before us. Many of us accept the stories handed down from our forebears, as one might inherit a keepsake tarnished with time. Yet some of us, in our rebellion or despair, deny these stories, claiming there is nothing beyond the borders of our own small worlds. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to cast them off like old clothes and don the new. In whatever way we tread, we seek to carve out a piece of ourselves with the chisel of our own notions of the divine. We wander, searching for a glimmer in the gloom to lead us from the shadows and into the light.\n\nA cardinal, he said, when I asked him the question. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless beat on the tin above us, and shared our silence like an old song. The rainwater coursed through the gutters, drowning the flowers that lined the porch, as if seeking to obliterate all trace of life. He looked out at the rain, his gaze a lost thing, caught between memory and dream. He had grown frail in those final months, his clothes hanging on him like ghosts of days past. His hair, once thick, had thinned, a whisper of what it was. He watched the rain still, as if in its falling he found some unspoken truth. I sat there with him, the words I could not say lodged in my throat, for to speak them would make them real. I moved closer, our chairs almost touching, and together we watched the rain fall in the twilight of that June evening.\n\nHe left us in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments had granted him a reprieve, a few more months, though at what cost I could not reckon. What god, I asked myself, allows such suffering? Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a god, I thought, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not want to watch him slip from this world to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the fading of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than the rest, better than those who watched over him at the end. He would not have wished for me to stand vigil at his passing. And so I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that came as quiet as a breath.\n\nBut no one called.",
            "In the long shadow of the Virginian fields where the earth holds its secrets and the sun beats down relentless as truth, there lived a man named John Taylor of Caroline. A man whose heart beat in time with the Republican dream and whose life was a testament to the soil and the sweat that it demands. An agrarian by blood and by belief, he walked the path of politics just long enough to carve his name into the stone of liberty, speaking out with a voice unyielding in matters of freedom and the reach of government. For Taylor, the land was sacred and the tilling of it a noble act upon which all else was built—his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the courts themselves rooted in this belief.\n\nThe land of the free held promise like an unbroken colt, wild and unencumbered by the chains of tradition. Taylor saw this vast expanse and in it the chance to craft a new covenant of governance. A place where the rights of a man stood as tall as the mountains and as unassailable as the stars. Each right a thread in the fabric of freedom, and if one were to fray, the whole would unravel, leaving nothing but the shadows of what once was. To Taylor, the state of nature was a place where the strong and the cunning held sway, a lawless land where might made right, but this was not to be the way of civilization.\n\nIn the crafting of this society, Taylor held firm to the belief that a government must embrace the duality of man, the light and the dark that reside in every soul. His words were as stern as the rocks of the riverbed, declaring that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles, he claimed, were the guardians of property and the stewards of the fields, standing in defiance of the encroaching tide of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles would remain true, no matter the greed and ambition of those who ruled. For self-interest was the compass by which man navigated, its morality judged by whether it served the common good or the selfish few. It was a good government that could harness this nature, but always under the watchful eye lest it stray into corruption.\n\nAmong the Republicans, Taylor stood resolute, calling for the Constitution to be held like scripture, its words binding and its powers limited. The Federal government, a beast that must be kept lean and its reach short, for fear of despotism lurking in the shadows of its ambition. Yet, he knew too that words alone were not enough. Their true meaning lay in the hearts of those who penned them, and without such understanding, the letter of the law could twist into tyranny. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true lodestar of the nation, a testament to a union of states, each sovereign and strong, rather than a single, monolithic entity.\n\nAnd so, John Taylor of Caroline stood, a solitary figure against the horizon, his life a testament to the land he loved and the freedoms he cherished, a voice echoing across the ages, calling us back to the principles upon which this nation was built.",
            "Downward he gazed, mind adrift in the empty fathom of the sight laid before him. Without a sound, without the stirrings of emotion, he beheld with an awareness honed over time, an awareness that dissected yet refused to tie the dissected parts to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted into his consciousness and then away, as if borne on some invisible current, too swift to grasp, too elusive to own. Such was the smooth, seamless dance of his faculties that it seemed he had no thoughts to claim as his own, merely a fluid engagement with what lay in his gaze.  \n\nOnce upon counsel from an artist of his acquaintance, he acquired a tome on the craft titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, the desire to learn the art of drawing had clung to him, and this book promised to unveil the secrets—from the essence of a pencil to the brain's alchemy of line and form. One lesson it offered was the use of a square frame to isolate the artist's subject. Thus, a chaotic tableau, a fruit bowl ensconced in a kitchen that opens into a dining room, could be distilled into a singular, manageable vision, that bowl of fruit centered on its simple plane.  \n\nYet there he stood, eyes fixed upon the bowl before him, unable to summon that artist's frame. Overcome, awestruck, he could only stand and marvel in silence. Picasso had his blue period; Monet reveled in verdant hues; the Italian Renaissance masters painted with a spectrum unbounded. Should he dare to claim his view as Artistic, there before him lay the embryo of his creation, the dawn of his narrative, his Work in Brown.  \n\nHis fingertips alighted on his chosen tool of creation, sinews tensed and released, his hand traversing the space between, his mind's resolve shaping itself in what might have been the most creative act of his existence. Water swirled, tranquil and unblemished, clear as crystal. Bits of matter departed from the whole, carried off to oblivion. Muscles tensed anew, twitching with impatience and resolve, his hand struck the toilet handle once more. The obstinate brown mass refused to yield, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain bottom.  \n\nMop held loosely in hand, feet braced a foot apart, the green tie tight around his neck, he frowned slightly at the insolent mass of processed life left as a testament to those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the wall to his right, seized the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it was swathed like an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended slowly into the bowl, akin to a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dusk of a world where youth takes the wheel too soon, there is a grim tally of lives lost among those who are yet to see the fullness of their days. The young drivers of America, bound by the chains of their own inexperience and the unripe nature of their minds, find themselves adrift on the highways of a perilous freedom. The National Institutes of Health speak of brains unfinished, of instincts not yet honed to the sharpness demanded by the unyielding road. Their hands, unsteady upon the wheel, steer them into the shadows of tragedy. \n\nIt is not the solitary road that claims them, but the presence of their peers beside them, the laughter and the clamor of youth unchecked. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has studied this dance of folly and found that with each young soul added to the vehicle, the specters of accident and ruin draw closer.\n\nIn the sunlit halls of governance, California and its kin have sought to lay down laws to shepherd these fledgling drivers, to bind them with provisional licenses that restrict their passage through the night and forbid the company of their fellows. Yet these are but frail barriers against the tide of statistics that mark the youngest among us as unfit for the burdens they bear. \n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze upon the reckless heart of youth and finds even eighteen too tender an age for such heavy responsibility. USA Today whispers of his research, of the youthful thirst for danger that does not abate until the years have tempered it. To delay the granting of license until this wildness subsides would be wisdom, a shield against the impending toll. For the day approaches when the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood the roads, a legion of potential peril.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this plight would not be a tangled affair. Schools could continue their teachings, sowing the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day earn the right to drive. But none under eighteen would take the wheel alone. A provisional phase would still precede the full rite of passage, and the hours of practice would remain—a number forged from the common practices of the states, such as the six hours behind the wheel and fifty hours with a guide that California demands.\n\nThe need for a unified, national decree is clear, for the specter of youth lost on the road is not confined to one land or another. It is a plight that demands a single voice, a singular act of protection for all who would step into the realm of the driver. This is not a new thought, but it is one whose time is come.",
            "In the quiet of the mind's labyrinth, where sounds are more than mere echoes, lies the enigma of Central Auditory Processing Disorder. It is a disorder not of the ear's hearing but of the brain's understanding. The disorder, known as CAPD or APD, speaks to the inefficiency of the central nervous system in translating the world of sound. Sounds that are clear as day to the ear become lost in the shadowed corridors of the mind, where words blend and noises become an indistinguishable hum. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association tells us that it is the perceptual processing of auditory information that falters, leaving the afflicted adrift in a sea of sound without a compass.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder, then called \"auditory imperception,\" came in the mid-1950s. Researchers, like wanderers in a dark wood, began to uncover the disorder's path. It was an Italian team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who first laid the stones for this path in 1954. Then came Kimura in 1961, with dichotic testing and a model to illuminate the physiology of the auditory system, like a lantern casting its light into the dark. By 1977, a conference gathered the minds of the time, sparking a flame of inquiry into the disorder that would be known as CAPD.\n\nThe disorder wears many faces. It is the inability to locate sound in space, a voice calling out but its source unknown. It is the muddling of acoustic events, two sounds that become one. It is the failure to recognize sound patterns, the music of the world reduced to a cacophony. It is the loss of speech's subtleties, sarcasm slipping past unnoticed. A sound blocked by another, an auditory puzzle unsolved. The clues that are heard but not understood, the sequence of sound lost in the shuffle. These are the hallmarks of CAPD.\n\nDiagnosis is a journey through observation and testing, a path walked by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. It is a landscape of questionnaires and surveys, where the patient's auditory behaviors are observed like a distant horizon. There is no single map, no consistent test to diagnose with certainty, and the cause remains elusive. Tests abound, challenging the patient to pick out words from a chorus, numbers from a din. Advanced tests peer into the ear, measuring the mind's response to the signals it receives.\n\nIn the end, the disorder remains a shadow on the mind, a whisper in the dark. It is a journey for the teachers who guide these children, to light their way in the mainstreamed classroom, to help them find their place in the world of sound.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, I find myself drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I aim to bring solace to children battered by life's cruelties and to offer a hand to families adrift in turmoil. I carry with me certain values, simple yet weighty: service, respect, an ethical spirit, a steadfastness to mend the ties between souls, and an unwavering resolve to hone my own craft, to remain ever adept in my chosen path. These are not mere tenets of the trade; they are the marrow of my being.\n\nThere was a time when the path lay shrouded, and I wandered in uncertainty. Yet always did I harbor a yearning to aid others. Through the corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many who turned their backs on woes that shadowed them, a few embracing poor crutches as their companions. It was in the face of such scenes that I turned to the study of the mind, seeking a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the path ahead remained obscured, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer’s day, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxiously on a couch, seeking refuge from the hands of his tormentors—his own kin. The next day he summoned the law to his home, and I, feeling the stirring within, went to see if I could be of aid. I spoke with the officers, sharing my recent schooling in Psychology. With the law’s limitations laid bare, they asked me to speak with the boy’s parents. In their presence, I found a pair cloaked in unease, their words mere smokescreens for their actions, painting their child as manipulative for seeking outside aid in resolving what they deemed \"simple\" disputes. It was then that the path of social work began to take shape before me, a calling to untangle such \"simple\" knots within the fabric of family life.\n\nAnother stone in the foundation of social work is the pursuit of social justice. In these times, society holds the individual to a pedestal, yet mourns those lost to the ages without truly understanding the essence of uniqueness. We profess the value of the individual, yet strive to mirror the many. I am but one, yet I resist the chains that seek to bind me to others' molds. Throughout my schooling, I stood against the tides of social injustice—my hair colored with defiance, my clothing a testament to self, my ears pierced beyond the ordinary. I pledged allegiance with the GSBA, fighting the specters of racism and discrimination wherever they reared their heads. I am a believer in social justice, and my protest against injustice shall not cease.",
            "In the bleak corridors of human understanding, where shadows cast by science and society meet, there lies the discourse on insomnia. Here, the biological and sociocultural models stand as sentinels, each offering its own fractured light upon the disorder. The biological tale is one of inheritance and the silent whispers of genes. The sociocultural tale speaks of the world's weight, of race and class and the myriad ties that bind a soul to its place in the order of things. What follows is an examination of insomnia through these dual lenses, a weaving of research threads that seek to unravel the intricacies of disorder. Each study, each finding laid bare, is scrutinized for its truths and its failings.\n\nSleep, that elusive balm, can be troubled in many forms. The mind, restless and unyielding, may birth its own demons. Or perhaps the body, through the ravages of substance or malady, refuses the peace of slumber. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to the specters that haunt the night. Insomnia, that failure to find rest, and its counterpart, hypersomnia, the struggle to stay awake. Narcolepsy, where dreams intrude unbidden upon the waking world. These disorders, each with its own dark signature, are the focus here, particularly insomnia, viewed through the lens of the biological and sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of biology, the story unfolds in the silent workings of neurons, the dance of chemicals and the legacy of genes. Within the hypothalamus, orexin neurons hold sway over the tides of sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice, creatures of the night, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors, guardians of slumber. The activation of these receptors, a gentle push toward sleep, a lesson learned from the simple creatures that scurry beneath the moon's gaze. The implication, a whisper that the same truths might hold for humans, that these receptors, inherited or altered, could govern a person's journey into the night. \n\nYet, the sociocultural tale is a different one, a tale of inheritance not just of genes but of circumstance. The world, with its relentless demands, its school and work and the mundane tasks that make up a life, would bear heavily on those whose sleep is disturbed. For the absence of rest is a thief, robbing focus and sapping strength, a burden carried through the long gray hours of day. Thus, insomnia stands at the crossroads of biology and society, a testament to the complex weave of human existence.",
            "I have wandered these grounds of University Park for what now counts as two and a half years, or four and a half semesters by the reckoning of the calendar, and the journey across this sprawling campus is no small matter. In the days of my freshman year, they put me up in a room at East Halls, cast away at the eastern fringe of this academic world, beyond which lies the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From my home in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning like Willard building, set near the heart of campus, it could be a long, cold march of twenty-five minutes on foot, especially when the State College weather conspired against me. \n\nI spoke with an alum, not many years my senior, who told of times when East Halls were isolated by vast swathes of unused earth. Those empty lands now brim with sports fields and grand new edifices, the Creamery, and a building for health services, encircled by apartments. The campus swells, and with its growth, the task of traversing it becomes more onerous. What remedy for this plight of movement? On a college ground, it is the bicycle that offers salvation. Yet a bicycle alone is naught without the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nA friend of mine, returned to the bicycle after years of neglect, mused why he ever forsook it. \"Bikes are a boon,\" he said. \"For a time, the fashion turned against them, but they are the only way to roam.\" Beyond the boon to body and health, cycling stands as the swiftest means of passage. A bowl of oatmeal and the strength of your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. Like others of my kind, I dwell off campus now, a distance from the center akin to that of some dorms. The wisest choice I made this year was to claim a bicycle as my own. Every day, I am called to class in Thomas building, a journey of twenty-five minutes on foot from my abode. With a bicycle, that time is cut to five minutes if I push hard enough. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, poses its own challenges for those on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, but time is a scarce commodity. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas daily would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my day. Over a week, that sums to more than two and a half hours. Add to that the minutes spent on other walks to classes, meetings, and so forth. It is time I cannot afford to lose.",
            "In the dim corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley casts a shadow over the march of technology and the capitalist edifice that props it, painting a landscape barren and stark with the specter of a dystopia. Within those pages, the souls that tread do so in the name of community, a unity forged at the cost of the self, each mind conditioned from the cradle to chase the hollow echo of immediate joy. They wander, these denizens, as pieces upon a board unseen, their paths carved by the unseen hand of the World Controller, an architect of their singular creed. Glance through the pane of Marxist theism and see the author’s wariness laid bare, a distrust threaded through the loom of those burgeoning systems. Terms of Marxist discourse—homogeny, reification—stand as sentinels, whispering Huxley’s cautionary tale of the economy’s birth pangs from his epoch’s womb.\n\nCapitalism stands mocked, a parody spun from the Marxist cloth of false consciousness. Herein, the common folk wander blind to the ties binding them to other castes in commerce’s dance, their eyes fixed upon their own reflections. Such blindness, borne of ideological chains, grips the proletariat and laborers, stark in the somnolent conditioning of Brave New World’s people. Deltas and Gammas, puppets all, driven by hypnopædia’s relentless chant to consume, to squander, to revel, a chorus orchestrated by the World Controller. The specter of hegemony looms, a dominion of one class over others, complete and unyielding. The lower castes remain in the dark, complicit in their own deception, bartering their souls for the gilded cage of capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, Alphas, Betas, with eyes open yet closed, content in their gilded chains, save for the few voices like Bernard, who dare to question the chains that bind. The interplay of these classes, as shall be unraveled, speaks to the fetters of capitalism’s grip.\n\nIn this world, true connections wither and die. Brave New World sketches its characters as shadows, bereft of life’s depth and color. Huxley hints at a truth: the twin specters of advancing technology and capitalism strip man of will and voice. Love’s flame is snuffed, and the spectrum of emotion dims to gray. Interactions drift upon the surface, men’s words of women reduced to flesh alone, women’s tales of encounters laid bare without shame. Complacency with their lot marks each class, testament to capitalism’s socioeconomic toll. Their unwavering march within the community’s bounds echoes Marxist thought—the proletariat, lulled into believing their dominion, while they consume, while they obey, while they march in lockstep with destiny’s decree.",
            "It was near four years gone when I took to studying the ways of Islam at the college. There in the room of learning, we did argue and debate over the nature of this faith, whether it bore any malice upon the world. It seems to me now, in these days of shadow and remembrance, that such a question holds more weight than at any time before. Since the towers fell and the earth trembled, I have seen the gaze of the world shift from one of suspicion towards Islam to a strange kind of acceptance within the lands of America. I reckon back in the year of 2001, the thought of a man called Barack Obama, with his roots tangled in the soil of the Muslim world, rising to seek the nation's highest seat would have been a notion met with disbelief.\n\nThe tale of the Prophet draws me in, for it is a curious thing, this recounting of Muhammad’s life, which seems to stand apart from the man himself as history has told it to me. I had thought him a conqueror, bending tribes to his will and faith by the sword’s edge. Yet, the story presents him as a martyr misunderstood, one who bore humility and whom others came to follow of their own accord, seeking the light in his words.\n\nThere are tales within that speak of wonders, akin to those of Jesus, and they sit uneasy with me. Like when Muhammad took the mutton and the milk and made it plenty for forty hungry souls. It seems to me the writers wished to paint him as a prophet of humble truth, content in his miracles. Yet, such writings seem to diminish the miracles of Christ, as though they would steal from His life and deeds to crown another.\n\nThe stories are many, and they speak of those who found their way to Islam, tales told through the voices of others, whispered down the line from one to another. And yet, I find this manner of storytelling suspect, for it seeks to lend weight to the truth yet strips the tales of their own.\n\nWhat stirs unrest within me is this effort to raise Muhammad as a man of gentle spirit and grace. But the annals of time tell a different story, one of power and conquest. I wonder if those who follow him now truly know the path he walked to claim his place in the world.",
            "The world turns and the teachings of the Nazarene linger as a whisper among the windswept plains of time. From his life onward, the course of Christian thought charted a path away from its original shores. In the wide arc of history, a drift is seen. A gulf that grows between the past and the present. The world today dances with a new awareness, a progress that moves in tides uncharted. Yet there are those who clutch to the old ways, who stand rooted as if against a storm, unmoved by the winds of change. They are few, their voices thin in the vast choir of time. Among believers, a hunger stirs. A thirst to peel back the years, to sift the truth from the dust of doctrines layered thick by time. It may take long years, decades, even centuries, but the wheel will turn. A great reversion will come. The march of history will bend back upon itself. A movement like the tide will rise, cleansing the layers of doctrine, stripping away the years until only the bare truth remains. That which the Nazarene spoke to the world. When this tide sweeps through lands, through the cities of the West, a new worship will rise. Pure and unadorned. And the church, the great institution, will stand as a beacon. Yet as the clock rewinds, a strange thing will happen. Diversity will give way, yielding to a sameness of belief and practice. Across the lands and seas, among the many sects, the differences will wane. Human history knows such reversals. Once, the Christians were hunted, shunned, slain by the might of Rome. Yet in time, Rome itself bowed to the cross. Our own nation walked the long road from chains to leadership. So it will be in the realm of faith. A return to the source, a stripping away of the years. And all this will hinge on a new understanding of the Nazarene's words. Not as fixed and solid, but as fluid, as metaphor. So what has been wrought since his time? Look far enough and you find only the roots of Judaism, the seedbed of Christian faith. A single God, the revealed word, the authority of the ancient texts. Such was the heart of faith when Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem. Yet within the Jewish fold, there was division. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the silent majority. Each a voice in an ancient chorus, each a thread in the tapestry of time.",
            "The world laid out in the pages of The Jungle is a testament to the dark and immutable greed that seeps through the veins of men. In the dim corridors of their hearts, there is but a hunger to sate their own desires, to carve out a slice of life that is theirs alone, heedless of the cries of those beneath them. Sinclair's narrative is a grim tapestry woven with the threads of ambition and indifference, its loom the great factories that rise like monoliths over the landscape, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke that stain the sky and the earth below. The owners, the managers, are architects of ruin, their vision tunneled and blind to the suffering that trails in their wake. In Sinclair's own words, the skyline is marred by these edifices of industry, the smoke a testament to the disregard they hold for life, human or otherwise.\n\nWithin the bowels of these factories, men are but cogs in a relentless machine, their worth measured in dollars and discarded when their usefulness wanes. The seething cauldron of jealousy and spite is their world, a place where loyalty is a currency long spent and decency an echo of something lost. Workers toil through hours that stretch like shadows, only to be cast aside without warning, their livelihoods snatched away by the whims of those who see them as nothing more than numbers on a ledger. In those times, the law held no solace for the laborer; the world was a wild place where power was unchecked and men were driven to the brink by the demands of progress.\n\nYet Sinclair's tale does not speak it plain; it is a whisper through the clamor of industry that the souls who labored and perished in Packingtown were bound to endure the misery thrust upon them. No savior came in the form of agency or organization to lend them aid, only the hollow promise of unions that fed upon the very lifeblood they claimed to protect. Trapped in a cycle as unforgiving as the machines they served, they were likened to slaves of old, their chains forged by hunger and desperation. A population teetering on the edge of starvation, their lives held ransom by men as ruthless as any slaver, their fates entwined with the capriciousness of those who held the reins of power. Immorality seeped into the very fabric of their existence, as inevitable as the dawn that broke over the smoke-choked horizon.",
            "In the darkened realm of literary echoes, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the shadows cast by those who came before. Thulé, a term that slips twice from the poet's quill, finds its roots tangled in the ancient lines of Virgil, whispered from the edge of the known world north of Britain. Yet, in the deepening dusk of his interests, Poe found allure in the Germanic whispers of Goethe’s voice. This affinity for Goethe's pen is not a mere shadow of imitation but a dialogue across the abyss of time, a kinship noted by Karl J. Arndt in his scholarly musings.\n\nGoethe, the architect of Faust's tragic saga, penned \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale heavy with the sorrow of a king, bereft of his queen, clutching a goblet as his sole companion. The king's life unwound like a dark fable, his possessions scattered to the winds save for that cup, which he cast into the sea before embracing his end. Such a spectral king, a reflection perhaps of Poe’s own lamentations and liquid solace, mirrors the landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" where color fades and dead friends haunt the lonely traveler.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thule, once within the torture-wrought walls of \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice as the somber pillars of \"Dream-Land,\" speaks to a deeper kinship with Goethe's mournful monarch. The world Poe sketches is a shadow of Goethe's, a dreamscape where the living and the dead coexist in a twilight devoid of color. Here, Poe, like Goethe's king, wanders through a world dimmed by loss, where the echoes of a bygone life linger like a haunting refrain.\n\nGoethe’s presence in the literary firmament was one that Poe could not ignore, not only for Goethe’s own sake but through the light cast by Tennyson's reverence. In this tangled web of influence and respect, Poe found himself entwined with Goethe’s legacy, a legacy that had seeped into the fabric of the time, woven into countless retellings and adaptations. Thus, \"Dream-Land\" becomes not merely a poem but a bridge, a spectral dialogue with the past, where Poe and Goethe stand like twin phantoms on the edge of eternity.",
            "The sun had long since begun its descent behind the California hills and the aisles of the grocery lay in a kind of twilight. It was there, on the cold tiles, that the applesauce lay spilled like some forgotten offering to the gods of negligence. Could a customer, injured in such a fall, find justice in punitive damages by laying bare the heart of the store's keeper, who twice had been told of the spill and yet did nothing, choosing his meal over duty?\n\nThe law would not easily banish Jennifer Palmer’s claim to the shadows. For punitive damages to be just, one must show the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that might come, such conduct deemed despicable. Palmer would argue that Martin, the manager, should have known the danger of leaving the spill, for others had fallen before her in those very aisles. Despite this, he did not act. The argument that his actions were despicable is perhaps less strong, yet it holds some weight, for six slip-and-fall incidents scar the year 2009 alone, and still, Martin did not ensure the safety of his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, as the clock struck five, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with news of the spill. But Martin, deep in his dinner break, dismissed Wayne’s words like so much ash on the wind. A quarter-hour later, Mary J. Haddigan, another soldier of the store, brought the same news, and once again, Martin turned away. At half-past five, it was Jennifer Palmer who met the floor, her back taking the brunt of the fall. Five such incidents had been reported in that year before hers, and now Palmer seeks recompense from D&D for her pain, both compensatory and punitive, as we ponder the wisdom of seeking to cut short her pursuit of the latter.\n\nIn California, the path to punitive damages for a breach of duty not born of contract lies in proving “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So states Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, according to the statute, is harm intended, or if intent be absent, conduct deemed “despicable” carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” The courts have marked conduct as malicious if the defendant, aware of the probable danger his actions posed, willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something she needed. A longing that refused to find its rest. It began when she was about fourteen, stepping into the tangle of teenage life. And it lingered still three years later at seventeen. By now she had come to know it was someone she sought, not something. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had tried, stumbling through awkward gestures to charm the uncharmable, but none captured her fancy. She puzzled over this odd notion, sifting through the reasons that might explain such a strange occurrence in a girl of her age. The years of pondering had yielded theories, but none strong enough to hold her speculation. So she moved through life, the question of her desires ever present.\n\nA day at home was typically a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle, calm souls. They never quarreled with one another, and it was a rare thing to find any discord between them and their daughter. The only contention was her insistence on her independence and the free spirit she bore. A daughter to such a composed pair, she was nonetheless their opposite, her vibrant personality a counterpoint to their tranquility, yet she was well-loved for her kindness and the joy she brought.\n\nBut today was not a day of calm. As she moved from room to room, seeking some spark for her own musings, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen, her mother’s voice, usually so melodious, now strained. She rushed into the room, a thread of panic winding through her. \"Mom? Mom, what’s wrong?\" she cried. She found her mother on the floor, wincing, breath coming in short bursts as she muttered \"Ow\" with each exhalation. She dropped to her side, a hand reaching out to ease her. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to—the hospital.\" The words were pressed out, each one tight with pain. Her daughter, now the stalwart of the house, was thankful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital stood an edifice of disinfectant and dread, the air tinged with the tang of fear. But her mind was too occupied with the task at hand to notice. She bore her mother swiftly inside, calling for aid. Faces, furrowed with concern, gathered round as a bed on wheels was brought forth and her mother was eased onto it. They took her away to be seen to, leaving the daughter alone in her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a step stool, reaching for a vase that rested on the highest shelf they had.",
            "In the silence of the study, the light sifted through the blinds, casting long shadows across the pages of numbers and notes. This inquiry, like a lone rider on an endless plain, sought to uncover the ways of the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled but whispered of in the halls of medicine. Here, in the heart of the land, the aMed diet, a variant of its Mediterranean kin, called for a bounty of plants, their roots deep in the earth, and the sea’s own fish, while turning away from the flesh of beasts and the heavy fats they bore. Even the spirits were welcome, in modest measure, to join this dance of sustenance.\n\nThe records bore witness to tales of those who followed this diet, their risks of the grim fate of heart disease and stroke lessened, as if the diet were a shield against time's cruel hand. In the chronicles of past studies, the Med diet stood firm against the specter of death, its power proven more potent than the low-fat ways in the battle against the bulge and the war of the blood.\n\nThis tale unfolded over years, with 74,886 women, their lives a tapestry of health and habit, unwound through the careful lens of the Nurses' Health Study. From the year of 1984 to 2004, they walked this path, their steps recounted through the food frequency questionnaires, echoes of their daily bread. The faith of these women stood strong, with over 95 percent holding to their course across two decades. Their tales of heart and stroke were etched in records, each stroke and heart attack a line in the annals of medical lore.\n\nThe numbers were gathered, the aMed scores tallied, like the counting of stars in the night sky, to smooth the random and reveal the true path of their diet. Care was taken to clear the fog of confusion, adjusting for age and smoke and the many ways a life could tilt the scale.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the story of the aMed score unfolded, revealing the path to lesser risks of heart and stroke. In two decades, the toll was counted: 2391 hearts faltered, 1763 strokes struck, and 1077 fell to the great silence of cardiovascular disease. Yet, those who adhered most closely to the diet’s tenets found themselves at less risk, as if the diet bore them through the storm, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those who strayed.\n\nThus, the Mediterranean diet whispered its promise, a promise of life and health amidst a world of shadow and decay.",
            "The sign stood stark against the drab horizon, a message scrawled in black ink that held the weight of a world gone mad. Hitler alive in Burma, it read. The girl beneath the sign, Ellen Page, star of a film once bright with youthful promise, stood alone on that street corner. Her face was a mask of quiet resolve, the cardboard a thin shield against the apathy of passersby. Burma, that distant land, a country known in the tongues of men as Myanmar, lay under the iron grip of a junta. They had seized power in '62, a coup d'état, a bloodless word for a bloody act. \n\nIn '07, the streets awoke. A decade of silence shattered by the voices of monks clad in saffron robes, their protests a revolution named for the color that cloaked them. The Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, the monks were allowed their peace—an uneasy peace—but soon the streets ran red. The military came down like a hammer, monasteries ransacked, and those who bore witness, journalists from lands afar, were caged or killed. Kenji Nagai, a name lost to the dust of September 27th, his crime merely to be there, to see. The death toll, they said, was thirteen. A number whispered by those who knew better to be thousands. Colonel Hla Win, a defector, spoke of it—a truth drowned in silence.\n\nBut this was no new story. The dance of power and dissent as old as the stones beneath their feet. Rome had its gods, emperors who ruled by divine right. Japan, with emperors deemed gods themselves, leading with iron and ritual, their legacy a tapestry of technology and tradition. In America, the president, George W. Bush, conversed with Ted Haggard, a man of strange convictions, in a world where absurdity and policy walked hand in hand.\n\nTiananmen, '89—a protest, a massacre, the numbers a shadow play of truth and fiction, the dead uncounted, unremembered. Rwanda in the '90s, a genocide that stained the earth, the Hutu against the Tutsi, a history written in blood. Hitler's Reich, the Third, a dark chapter where the world looked away as millions perished. All these, echoes of a past that refuses to die, haunting the edges of a world forever teetering on the brink.",
            "In the dim and shadowed corridors of jazz there stood a man whose name was Duke and whose music lay like a tapestry woven in the dark. His life long and his creations longer still, for in his hands the orchestra became a living thing, a beast of sound and silence. At the heart of it all, the piano’s voice was soft, a whisper in the gathering storm, yet it was his mind that shaped the tempest. The compositions chosen here tell tales of his craft, where each note was a thread and each musician a color in the fabric. He laid down the paths where the soloists wandered, free as birds in the evening sky, and he drew them back again to the tight embrace of his orchestrations, each piece a testament to their style and his vision. The orchestra was his canvas, the sounds he conjured were like none other, fitting each piece like a glove to a hand, each sound a testament to the mastery of the man who knew the soul of each player and how they sang together in the growing choir of his dreams. \n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks his name and mentions Creole Love Call, where the voice becomes an instrument and words are but shadows. It was here that Duke first wove voice into the tapestry, a rich color without the burden of lyrics. The piece stands as a monument to his ability to match the voice of his soloists to the song’s soul. It unfolds in six choruses, each a step in its journey:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response that echoes like voices in a canyon, the voice smooth and then rough like the wind through the trees.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet weaves its tale, bending notes like reeds in the water.  \nChorus 3: A clarinet's cry high and sweet, with the piano's soft syncopation beneath it.  \nChorus 4: The band a reflection of the first chorus, brass and reeds answering each other.  \nChorus 5: The piece's heart, where the high reeds call and the brass and rhythm respond in syncopated time.  \nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, voice and reeds in their dance, the voice now growling like some wild thing.  \nTag: A fleeting moment, a vocal run, the trombone's dissonance a final note.\n\nVoice as color, as texture, a thread in the fabric of his work, this was but one of his many gifts. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, the Duke mixed tight orchestration with the hues of tone color. A call and response, “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet muted, Baby Cox’s scat singing, each borrowing from the other, each a shadow and a light. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart in Duke's orchestra, gives the melody voice on his muted trombone, an extension of the ideas that lay within the Duke’s mind, ever reaching, ever seeking, forever crafting the music of the night.",
            "In the vast theater of existence, one question lingers in the shadows: why do living things shape themselves the way they do? Does some unseen hand guide their transformation, shackled by chains of limitation? It was in 1917 when D’Arcy Thompson mused, as if whispering to the void, that the zoologist had not yet dared to speak the simplest forms of life in the language of numbers. And still, the echo of that thought remains. Yet, in the quiet corridors of recent times, the mathematicians have turned their gaze upon the humble mollusk, tracing the lines of its shell through time's passage, both its youth and its lineage, seeking to unravel the mysteries therein.\n\nOur study, like a lone wanderer in the desert, seeks to harness the power of mathematical modeling, to peer deep into the heart of Prunum, to understand the forces that shape its journey through the ages. We look at the bones, the very structure of these creatures, through the ghostly images cast by X-rays, and from these, we draw the lines and numbers that will tell us of their past and their possible futures. These numbers, these whispers of existence, feed the hungry mind of the software CerioShell, as if it were a beast of the machine, and from it, we conjure the forms that might yet be.\n\nA shell, you see, is a tube, a tunnel through the void of time, spiraling in endless circles, a helix of life. Each turn, each whorl, is a dance around a phantom spine, the columella, the pillar of its being. The speed of this dance, this eternal spiral, is marked by sutures, the scars of its journey. And the grandest of these turns is the final one, the body whorl, the culmination of its life's voyage. Above it, the spire, a crown of all that came before, reaching ever upwards. The apex, the pinnacle, and below, the base, the foundation. From the shell's heart, the creature emerges, through the aperture, the gateway to the world.\n\nWe peer at their forms from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a different tale. To count the whorls, to unravel this spiral, one must begin at the top, discerning the first suture, drawing the line that splits the shell's story in twain. And from there, count the whorls, precise to the quarter turn, tracing the arc of life.\n\nA shell's journey is a series of apertures, a path carved through space and time, as the creature builds its home. One can map this journey, chart the course of the aperture, through coordinates and radii, both horizontal and vertical. This path, this trajectory, can be drawn upon paper, captured in the language of mathematics. And with that language, with those numbers, we can alter the course, manipulate the very making of the mollusk's shell.",
            "In the waiting shadow of a decade, the numbers stood still, unyielding. Neonatal and infant mortality, unmoved in the vast archipelago of Indonesia. The nation strides forth, meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, water and sanitation within reach, yet the specter of maternal and child health looms large, the goals for 2015 slipping further into the horizon. Herein, the reasons lie scattered like fallen leaves, pointing to the frailty of the health system, a call to fortify its bones rather than chase after fleeting interventions.\n\nThere's been progress, they say. Seventy-two percent of births now find themselves under the watchful eyes of skilled hands. Yet those hands include the midwives, the wise women of the village, who hold no scalpel, who cannot ward off the shadow of a complicated birth. And so, the blood flows, and the mothers are lost. Deceptive, these numbers, masking the work yet to be done. Meanwhile, the healers for the children, those who mend the bellies of the young, seem fewer. The records of care after birth, fragments incomplete, tell a story of neglect, of low numbers across the land.\n\nThe cut that saves, the cesarean, is rare. Four percent, it whispers. Seven in the cities, but in the countryside, it is only two. The disparity speaks of a land divided, where the roads to health lie clustered in the city’s embrace. The poor, too, find themselves at the end of a long road. Twenty-seven percent separates the rich from the poor in the quest for care, the cost paid in coins and in lives.\n\nAs the future beckons, the path is unclear. How does one mend this broken tapestry of care? Does the solution lie in the silos of programs, or in the foundation of the system itself? The allure of programs is undeniable, their targets clear, their goals attainable. Yet the danger lies in their singular focus, for where one field flourishes, another withers. Resources drawn to the bright flame of funding leave others in shadow. Programs uncoordinated, services duplicated, a tangle of forms and paper trails, all whispering of a need unmet.\n\nAnd so, the question lingers in the heavy air: Where do we go from here?",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has swelled, its borders stretching to encircle a multitude of genres, each a testament to the human spirit's restless quest for expression. It is a labyrinthine world, where genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—mere whispers of names upon the wind—branch into countless sub and sub-sub genres, each a tributary to the great river of sound. Amongst these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands as a colossus, unmatched in its diversity and in the depth of its expression over these past forty years. It is a music of shadows and echoes, where the spectrum of emotion is broad yet often cast in somber hues. From its inception, Heavy Metal revealed a malleability, a capacity for variation that artists seized upon to craft new sub-genres, and from these, further branches sprouted, a tree ever-growing, its roots deep in the earth of time.\n\nIn this day, we find ourselves amidst a thicket of Heavy Metal's offshoots, each a niche unto itself, blurring the lines of what Heavy Metal truly is. It has become a mosaic, drawing in themes from distant musical lands, yet all journeys have a beginning. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the world today, one must first comprehend this movement—a force that transcends mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement carved from darkness. It is a symphony of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more spectacle. It is a testament to skill, where the musicians wield their instruments with a mastery that sings through the chaos. And yet, it is a movement steeped in the haze of substance, for the psychedelic tides of the mid-seventies washed over the creators, birthing works of otherworldly madness, with the drugs a convenient muse. Metal's heart is visceral, its soul a sonnet of the dark, a revelation to a musical landscape that had seldom dared tread such shadowed paths. The echoes of the Romantic Era's brooding cadences whisper through its veins. Lyrics, like those penned by Byrne, speak to the darkness that forms the bedrock of this movement.\n\nConsider Helter Skelter, where the Beatles ventured into the abyss. It is a dance of highs and lows, a reflection of a drug-laden odyssey. Some declare it among the first Heavy Metal songs, a retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into heaviness. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle, to show that they too could plumb the depths, and so they enshrined it within The White Album.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists began their dream-laden canvases, there stood Henri Rousseau, crafting dreams with the steady patience of a man laying bricks against the passage of time. The Dream, a painting from 1910, bore witness to his journey, a tableau of wonder and longing. There, a woman sat, eyes wide at the marvels unfolding around her in the landscape of her slumber. Yet it was not just her dream Rousseau painted; it was his own, a dream of being counted among the greats, of hearing his name spoken in reverence across the salons and galleries. In his heart, a war raged, a question hung over his art like a shadow: to echo the voices of others, to mold his brushstrokes to the forms of those deemed worthy by the critics, or to let his heart guide his hand, to paint with the rawness and truth of his own vision. The Dream stands like a stone marker at a crossroads, capturing the very essence of his battle, the choice between conformity and the wild, uncharted path of originality. \n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first pause and consider the man himself, Henri Rousseau, born in the spring of 1844 in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father was a man of modest means, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who tasted the comforts of bourgeois life. Rousseau, he did not come to art by way of academies or schools. His days were spent in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a keeper of tolls, though many would mistakenly dub him a douanier, a customs inspector. Life dealt him its blows—a wife lost, Clémence by name, and with her the lives of eight children who never saw the light of day. Only his daughter Julia remained, a living reminder of what was taken. In his sorrow, he turned to the canvas, seeking solace in the creation of something new. Unlike his contemporaries who painted tales of peasants with rose-tinted brushstrokes, Rousseau remained a folk painter at heart, his dreams and aspirations rooted in the soil of his class. \n\nIt was not surprising that Rousseau yearned for the approval of the art world. He was a man who came to painting without the pedigree of formal training, a novice who picked up his brushes later in life, surrounded by the luminaries of modern art who cast long shadows. Recognition was a slow river, and though he labored for years, it was only in the dawn of the new century that the world began to take notice, a time when Matisse was already carving out his legacy. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon wrote of them both, acknowledging a truth: while Matisse painted with the fear of falling into the mundane, Rousseau sought to paint the very picture that would unlock the gates to the Artiste Français, to be counted among their ranks.",
            "In the quiet of the world there lies a thread unbroken, a tie that binds the seen to the unseen, the truth to the beauty. Many have pondered this link that seems to defy the edges of knowing, a connection that whispers in the shadows of our existence. Keats, in his own way, has spoken of it, the urn bearing witness to a truth that is beauty and a beauty that is truth. In this world we wander, much of what we gather is through the lessons of the world and the harshness of experience. Yet there are things we seem to know without the learning, an innate understanding that speaks to us of ethics and aesthetics in ways beyond the teaching.\n\nThe essence of ethics and beauty, it seems, is not in the telling but in the showing. They are not prescriptions laid down in stone but whispers of understanding that skirt the edges of our comprehension. We do not seek to dictate what is good or fair but rather to unravel the why of it, to understand the grace of a painting or the righteousness of an act. Critics may speak of Mona Lisa’s mysteries in terms of light and shadow, of history and form, but the essence of her smile eludes them. When asked of our own heart’s favorite, we might stumble over words, saying only, “There’s something about it,” before the walls of explanation rise around us. Art and morality, both, resist the cages of description, standing as Flannery O’Connor put it, as stories that cannot be spoken in any other tongue. They whisper of a beyond, a transcendence that remains when the words have faded, a truth that stands alone.\n\nIn the quiet places of our hearts, ethics and art speak in voices not of this world. As Wittgenstein suggests, ethics cannot be caught in the trap of expression. They are the gleam off distant waters, the echo of a song we cannot quite remember. This nameless something, this je ne sais quoi, is the soul of art and morality, a power that lies in the spaces between words, in the unsaid and the unspoken.\n\nThe bond between morality and art is forged in the fires of the unseen, where the world touches the eternal. Literature, perhaps most of all, holds the weight of this truth. McKean speaks of its moral heart, of how it holds a mirror to life’s values, reflecting the principles that guide us through the darkness. In literature, as in life, we find the measure of what matters, the echo of our own souls in the written word. Here, in the pages of story, we see ourselves, and in seeing, we understand.",
            "In the expanse of shadows cast by the Alps down to the Baltic's restless edge lies a nation, stitched together from the sinews of time. Germany, a land forged in the crucible of history, where the echoes of ancient tribes still whisper in the wind that sweeps across the Rhine from Köln to the Elbe's Saxon banks in Dresden. This tapestry of culture, woven of many threads, draws from the roots of Germania, the ancestral soil.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost in the annals of time, stirs debates among the scholars who seek its origin. Tacitus, in the dim corridors of history, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe whose name was once German before they dared the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first penned \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars, a distinction born from the tongues of the Gauls to mark those unconquered beyond the river’s icy flow. The word's birth remains shrouded; some say it spoke of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, others of spears glinting in battle, or the clamor and cry that marked their presence (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC; O.E.D, 2010).\n\nIn the annals of Tacitus, penned in the year of our Lord AD 98, he spoke of the Germans, untamed and pure, their blood unmixed by the tide of migration. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"for in ancient times, it was not by land but by ship that those seeking new homes arrived. Who would forsake Asia, Africa, Italy for Germania's wild lands, its sky leaden, its manner grim, unless it was his birthplace?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWho indeed would leave the marble heart of Rome for the shadowed forests of Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions, seeking the spoils of these untamed lands. Yet, like the tide, they often receded to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging like specters in the first century's twilight, lingered on Rome's periphery, trading the land's bounty and lending their strength to the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, disguise serves as a cunning tool, one that can weave an intricate tapestry of deceit. Yet, it is a double-edged sword, for in its shadow lies the peril of losing oneself eternally. To end such a masquerade is to face the abyss of alienation. A choice must be made, between the preservation of self or the fragile bonds that tether one to others. And while some may greet revelation with indifference, others will not suffer such trickery lightly, their offense a testament to the charade's folly.\n\nThe matter of deception intertwined with the reversal of gender roles becomes a tangled skein, raising questions that gnaw at the soul. Chief among these is the query: why? What compels one to abandon their true self, donning the guise of another gender? Viola's path is one of necessity, a shield against a world of potential harm: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a land foreign and unknown, Viola finds her refuge in the semblance of manhood, a cloak against the wolves that might prowl. Yet, this guise isolates her from the sisterhood she might have known, severing the ties of feminine kinship. Her mimicry is so flawless that Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, succumbs to love's blind folly. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). And still, there lies the unspoken yearning between Viola and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo the discerning eye of the modern reader, Twelfth Night reveals how deception can unearth the buried truths of the heart, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The presence of Viola as Cesario forces these characters to confront desires long hidden in shadow. Does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from the appearance of manhood or does it betray an unspoken inclination towards women? Yet, one might argue otherwise, viewing Olivia as a satirical figure, a mirror reflecting those who judge solely by outward guise.\n\nHer swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her acceptance of Viola as kin rather than paramour—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—speaks to the caprice of her heart, shaped by the whims of sight alone.",
            "Under the indifferent sun of the colonial expanse, the German dominion was not a singular beast. It was a varied and multifaceted entity, brutal in some quarters and yet capable of nurturing, as the shifting sands of its territories attested. Like the distant echoes of a gunshot, the scars of its reign lingered most fiercely upon the Ovaherero and Nama, their fate sealed in the unforgiving deserts of German South West Africa. Yet, to paint the entire empire with the same brush is to overlook the discordant notes in its symphony of rule. \n\nIn the heart of Tanganyika, under the British eye in 1919, they unearthed a populace that spoke in the tongues of books and letters, a testament to the German hand that had once guided them. Kamerun, too, bore witness to the commendations of chroniclers who praised the educational endeavors of the Germans there. But in the barren stretches of South West Africa, the story differed. There, the mission of education for the native was a task abandoned to the missionaries, their palms open to the sky for whatever scant government blessing might fall their way. Meanwhile, the European youth basked in the structured embrace of state schools, the coffers opened wide for their enlightenment.\n\nThe legacy of this disparity rippled through time, leaving South West Africa adrift in a sea of ignorance, the people unlettered and voiceless. It was a consequence born of many threads—social, political, economic—all weaving a tapestry of neglect. This paper seeks to unravel those threads, to shine a light on the settlers and the rulers, to understand the weight of their gazes upon the native souls.\n\nIn the annals of history, penned mostly in the German tongue and inscribed during or just after the empire's fall, lies a wealth of knowledge on this colonial education. Early accounts sought merely to document, but later voices in English expanded the tale, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the intricacies of each colony's approach to learning. Among these, Cohen stands prominent, dissecting the educational pathways of South West Africa alongside its eastern counterpart. His findings trace the roots of divergence to the settler masses who called South West Africa home, their presence shaping the schools that rose from the dust.\n\nIn South West Africa, the land was kinder, its climate temperate despite the desert's reach. This drew Europeans to its bosom, nearly fifteen thousand by 1913, standing in stark contrast to the more modest gathering in East Africa. Thus, the story of education in the German colonial empire is one of contrasts, of lands and peoples, of intentions and outcomes, each chapter written in the ink of its own circumstances.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stood as two nations entwined in a rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the close of 1893. At the heart of this struggle was the Mexican-American War, a conflict waged between 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in an act of conquest, seized from Mexico the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new territories. This was but the peak of many confrontations that would echo between the two until the eve of the Great War.\n\nThis tale of rivalry is not unlike that of other nations who share their borders, for the earth is carved with lines that separate and yet bind. Nations that are neighbors often find themselves in the throes of conflict, their interests clashing like waves against the shore. As Pletcher once noted, the United States found its most enduring diplomatic trials with Mexico and Cuba, while other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations.\n\nReligion, too, played its part, as it has in the stories of many lands. It was a rift as old as the hills, borne from the suspicion between the English and the Spanish, a distrust passed down from their colonial forebears. Frahm wrote of this, likening it to the ideological struggles of later years, where the United States stood opposed to the specters of fascism and communism, yet in those earlier times, it was against Catholicism and monarchy that they railed. Thus, the seeds of discord were sown, hindering the path to peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts, those chroniclers of old, counted seventeen disputes between these nations during their half-century of rivalry, most of them over the lands they bordered. Bandits and outlaws traversed these lines, causing strife until both nations marshaled their forces to quell the unrest.\n\nBut time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt speaks of the shift in the winds, as Mexico found itself leaning upon the United States, its ambitions no longer for land but for the wealth within. Thus did the fires of rivalry cool, and a new era dawned on the horizon.",
            "Fifteen years past, an affliction unknown and unbidden laid me low, a shadow come to steal the light from my days. I had been a nurse, sworn to the call of healing, drawn to it by the deep-seated yearning for a safety and security that had eluded my childhood. The words echoing like a chant in the halls of memory—\"Work will always be there; the sick will always need tending.\" These words shaped my path, though the heart held dreams of science and the ink of journalism, a blend of the two perhaps. Yet it was nursing I chose.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, unmoored, single, pockets near empty, and the work denied me. Disabled still, these fifteen years on, living by the grace of Social Security’s mercy, with naught to claim as my own. Life’s course a constant struggle, a siege upon the bastions of security and self-worth. Certainty, that old companion, now a ghost. Yet through it all, one truth stands immutable: without the kindness of kin and the steadfastness of friends, these years would have been insurmountable, no matter the strength I fancied I possessed. For when calamity comes, it strips bare the illusion of strength.\n\nLife holds its calamities, the small and the vast. No certainties, no assurances stand unbroken, and preparation, though it girds us well, cannot alone conquer the immense. I find myself in accord with the notion that we mustn't place our trust solely in the crumbling edifice of government. Yet I hold dear the belief that we must rekindle the trust amongst ourselves, learn once more the art of giving aid and seeking it, rather than retreating to solitude, building bunkers against the world.\n\nThis talk of rugged individualism, the mythic backbone of this land, but truth lies elsewhere. It was compassion and shared burdens that sustained our forebears through the lean times, not solitary striving. The wagon trains that braved the Rockies to the far coast did not travel in isolation.\n\nSo yes, prepare as you must. I am ready. A kit of necessities, a balm against disaster. Supplies for wounds, tablets to make water pure, plastic and tape to seal against unseen threats. Flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches to light the dark. Canned goods to stave off hunger. If land is yours, and the means to farm it, to preserve its bounty, then do so. A wood stove is a wise companion, though perhaps not for those in lofty dwellings.\n\nBut remember, in your preparations, to know your neighbors.",
            "In a time long past, in the dusked corridors of history, there came into being a prince whose path would wind through the world and away from it, toward enlightenment, and in the telling he would be known as Buddha. In such manner did the teachings rise, like smoke from a distant fire, and they would bear the shape of Buddhism, rooted in the ancient earth yet reaching ever upward. Among its branches, there is one most true, called Theravada. The faith breathes the air of some twenty-five centuries, and time has carved it differently from the days when the Buddha walked beneath the sky. It manifests in places like Sri Lanka, where men of robes and men of toil partake in the waters' annual communion, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such rites. These shifts run deep, from the surface of ritual down to the marrow of salvation. And so the Theravada way, in its cloisters and in its homes, has learned to bend beneath forces, both from within and without, both harsh and indifferent.\n\nTerms must be drawn here like lines in the sand. The internal and the external, these are the first. Internal, born of those who walk the path of the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the yellow robes or not. External, the winds that blow from the lands of other faiths. Hostile forces are those that strike at the heart, wishing ill or casting shadows on the Buddhist soul. Benign forces pass like clouds, neither to aid nor to hinder, yet their shadows may cool or darken all the same. These will be our compass as we seek to understand.\n\nTo begin, one must look to the heart of the faith, the doctrines that burn like a steady flame in the night. Refuge is sought in the triple gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, bound in the Tripitaka, the baskets that hold the teachings. The Sutta Pitaka, with its words like rivers. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules that bind. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, the thoughts that roam the sky. Metaphysics speaks of Anatta, the void of self; Dukkha, the sorrow stitched into life's fabric; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Only in seeing these can one step off the wheel, the unending turn of death and rebirth, the great Sansara. And with its end, desire and hatred and delusion shall fall away, a lightening of the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the path of conduct. Five precepts for the layman: to kill not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not, to drink not. For the monks, the rules are many and strict. At the center of all, the four noble truths stand like sentinels. Dukkha, the world’s sorrow. The chain of suffering, forged by attachment. And the promise that the chain can be broken."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast expanse of human dealings, culture casts its shadow long and deep. It is defined as much by its absences as by its presence, a specter of many forms. It is neither a monolith nor a singular path. To say all Russians stand immovable or all Japanese yield with ease is to paint with a brush too broad, a canvas too simple. In the heart of negotiation, the keen eye sees beyond the veneer of generalities, seeking the pulse of what a culture truly means to the dance of discourse. When a foreign culture beckons, it is measured against the yardstick of one's own land, and the mind grapples with echoes and reflections.\n\nTo delve into the heart of another culture is to wander through its history, to touch the edges of its biases. Judgment and change are not companions here. Acceptance holds the key, especially when the winds of negotiation blow cold against one's back. In foreign lands, the recognition of customs, the homage to beliefs, can bridge the chasm of difference, nudging the talks forward.\n\nYet, culture's reach does not end at borders drawn upon maps. Within the walls of corporations, a culture all its own takes root. Some demand the sacrifice of hours upon the altar of work, while others embrace a gentler pace. It shows itself in the garments of workers, in the words they choose, in the ways tasks are parceled out. Some firms call upon their kin to give freely, while others bind such acts to sanctioned causes. The American corporate landscape, diverse as its wide plains and bustling cities, is testament to the myriad ways culture breathes life into the notion of work. In lands less fractured, cultures may seem more whole, but beneath that surface lies depth waiting to be unearthed.\n\nIn the end, it is the values that speak the loudest, whispering the reasons why a culture moves as it does. To save face, to hold dear the harmony of the many—such are the tokens that guide a negotiator's hand. A soul from a land where bargains are battles will not yield easily, nor rush to closure. These truths must be carried close, before the table is set and the dance commences. Yet, wisdom lies in knowing the soul across the table, for in their story lies the path to a negotiation well met.",
            "In the quiet of an ancient text, the fool's heart whispers there is no God. Psalm 14, the old scripture, speaks first this thought, and St. Anselm takes it up in his quest for proof of the divine. This belief, shared by the likes of Thomas Aquinas, stands as a citadel in their writings on God's existence. Our task, to weigh which argument holds the greater truth, must begin with a quiet assumption. We shall assume they are both right in their belief, in the God of the Bible, for to entertain a different God would unravel the tapestry of their arguments, leaving us with threads instead of a whole cloth. Yet, in this quiet meditation, I suggest that neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a complete path to belief.\n\nLet us first walk with St. Anselm, whose steps trace a journey of faith. He turns inward, gazing at the soul's landscape, where he finds God etched into the mind’s corners. Anselm speaks of a God whose presence is so deeply woven into our understanding that to imagine otherwise is folly. His words, dense and labyrinthine, tell of a proof that rests not in the world but within the soul's quiet knowing. He invites us to see that the truth of God is not found in the world's clamor but in the silent certainties of the mind. This is faith, the Christian texts say, the acceptance of truths unseen, unproven by the world outside.\n\nContrast this with St. Thomas Aquinas, who stands on the firm ground of reason. To him, God is a truth born of logic and observation, no faith required. His method, a boon to the evangelist, for it builds a bridge of reason to the unconverted, needing no leap into the unseen. Aquinas lays out five paths of reason: the change, the cause, the contingent, the degrees of excellence, and the harmony. Each is a step that shows God as a necessity of logic, a puzzle piece unseen yet whose outline is clear in the picture it completes. Thus, the discourse unfolds, each man offering a different road, yet both leading to the same unseen city.",
            "In the world of letters, authors weave their words with the skill of craftsmen, each turn of phrase coaxing from the page a certain spirit, a certain manner by which we come to know the tale they tell. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he among them, employs such craft in his telling of The Great Gatsby. He conjures images with an unusual marriage of words, pairing the unexpected with the familiar, casting a spell over the reader, an atmosphere suspended in delicate balance. He draws upon the essence of symbols, colors chief among them, to breathe life into the narrative. Gold and green, white and gray, red and pink—each shade is a thread in the tapestry of his world. Their meanings, like whispers on the wind, are built carefully, layer upon layer, until they resonate with the reader's soul.\n\nThe colors white and gray bear a weight of meaning under Fitzgerald's hand, a quiet uniformity, white with its veneer of class, gray with its whispers of time's passage. We see this from the outset as these shades cloak the characters and their world. Daisy and Jordan, always in white—Nick too, in his white flannels at Gatsby's revels, Tom in his white shirt beside Myrtle, and Catherine, powdered milky white. The halls of Gatsby's dwelling, a riot of colors, stand apart, marking a departure from this palette. These hues, white and gray, paint the cityscape and its people—Nick descending amidst the white chasms of New York, the names of Gatsby's guests now gray upon Nick's ledger, Catherine’s home, a white cake of apartments. The world itself is streaked with these colors—Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood, the gray cars and gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child's grayness, the gray old man selling dogs.\n\nFitzgerald, thus, arms these colors with the power to denote insignificance, a sameness that envelops certain figures in the tale. Daisy, clad in white, seated in her white roadster, becomes less a person, more an ideal, a thing Gatsby covets. She is the gray haze on a fur collar, the white dress before the duel of words between Tom and Gatsby. Through these hues, Fitzgerald crafts a vision of Daisy as less substance, more shadow, an echo of longing in the heart of a man.",
            "In the mild embrace of San Diego's unyielding sun, the land lays forth its bounty. Tomatoes and citrus fruits, greens of the field, the tender hearts of squash, and the dark crowns of broccoli all find their place in this fertile soil. There too are the herbs, the trees heavy with peaches and lemons, the berries ripening in the light, and honey and peppers, each one a testament to the earth's generosity. There is a hunger here for the pure, the organic, and the earth answers with sustenance. The people wait, their names inscribed upon lists, yearning for the harvest of these lands. Eggs and milk, untouched by the hand of man, flow from these fields to the tables. Upon these farms, life is not merely cultivated but observed, as birds take to the sky and the feet of wanderers tread the paths offered. Here is a place where the landowner might harness the gifts of man’s governance, not just to reap but to preserve, to educate, and to prosper.  \n\nAmidst this bounty, the land speaks of another kind of wealth, one not measured in coin but in life itself. The organic way offers a sanctuary for wild things, for plants and creatures, safe from the taint of chemicals. Yet, it asks a price. The labor is hard, the toil unending. The war against weeds and pests is fought without the familiar weapons, the soil is fed without the ease of synthetics, and the harvest is less certain. The small farm lacks the might of its larger kin, the efficiency that comes with scale. To walk the path of the organic farmer is to embrace the burden of the earth itself, to plant and graze, to remove what does not belong, to shape the land for the life that calls it home. And so, the landowner might seek counsel and assistance, to balance the scales of profit and preservation.\n\nIn this tale, the land rests beside the town of Potrero, in the wilds of San Diego County where the Cleveland National Forest stands as a guardian. It is 160 acres of chaparral and grassland, of oak woodlands whispering to the skies. Here, the ecoregion tells its own story, part of a grand plan to safeguard the lives of many, plants and beasts alike. The land remembers those who came before, the Native Americans who knew its song, and the settlers who sought its promise. This land, once a homestead, where cattle grazed and wood was hewn, now stands at the crossroads of past and future. \n\nI chose this land from the offerings of the modern world and sought to understand what aid might come to one who wishes to farm it in harmony with nature. In doing so, I found a farm nearby, a model of what might be, a place where the earth's voice is heard, and its gifts are given.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, a bond unyielding and beyond recall. Within this tether lie emotions manifold: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, each an ember in the fire of kinship. Brothers, bound by blood, see in one another a mirror of themselves, a reflection clearer than any other bond might conjure. It is when the world turns dire and shadows lengthen that this bond’s true nature reveals itself, be it light or dark. Such revelations come at a cost, their toll exacted in the currency of consequence. To know the emotions born of this fraternal link is to reckon with the price they demand. When a brother looks upon his kin and sees his own visage, it is not as the world sees him, but as he is, unadorned. In the deeds done and the echoes they leave behind, therein lies the heart of their character. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers walk the edge of this theme, where emotions rage and swirl like storms. Through a landscape lush and vividly wrought, they embark on a journey destined for ruin. Bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in the tale’s crescendo, and only one brother emerges from the tempest alive. The theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and their shared moments, all seen through the narrator’s eyes, which cast light upon the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his view of the world, both shaping his every act.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist’s deeds lies a singular emotion: pride. From the first steps they take together to their final, fatal trek, he harbors a quiet resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother, one to whom he might impart his worldly skills, the arts of breath-holding, running, leaping, climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with in the high forks of the great pine behind the barn. Yet, these dreams lay shattered, for Doodle was born frail of heart, the specter of death a constant companion, his body ill-suited for the rigors of boyhood fancy. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, whose head teemed with wild imaginings, to find his visions dashed. In his heart, anger stirred, a dark contemplation of ending the small life with a pillow's soft suffocation. What child, in the innocence of youth, might harbor thoughts of such finality? But then, a smile from the small one, a simple curve of lips, and hope unfurls in the protagonist’s heart. This fleeting act reveals that his resolve was not as steel. In the recesses of his mind, love for his brother lay, quiet and instinctive, waiting to be called forth.",
            "In the vast and tangled architecture of the human mind lies a complexity crafted through the ages. Like the deep and ancient forests that once knew only the whisper of the wind, so too has the understanding of the brain evolved from crude beginnings to something more like the precision of a machine. We once likened it to a wax tablet, then to the papyrus scrolls of lost civilizations, and in the march of time, we saw it as a book, and now speak of it as a computer. Yet even these metaphors fall short, like shadows that slip between the fingers, cautioning us against the folly of easy conclusions.\n\nThe journey of thought begins with the senses, those primal gateways that capture the world in all its rawness. The touch, the warmth, the sound that echoes through the empty halls of the universe, the light that falls like a benediction—each is transformed into the secret language of the brain, a code of electrochemical whispers. Here, the brain performs its dance, spinning this raw data with algorithms both simple and profound, weaving it into a tapestry of understanding. In the act of seeing a black box upon a field of white, the mind gathers the simplest truths—color, shape, the sharpness of an edge—and from these, the image is built in the mind's eye. The mind, always a step ahead, uses its top-down wisdom to see not just a shape but a box, not a void but a presence.\n\nYet as the threads of thought are spun, there is a filter that stands sentinel, discerning what is worthy of the mind's full embrace. In the chaos of green blades beneath one’s feet, the mind sees only what it must, turning away from the countless distractions of the world. Yet even in a room awash with noise, a name can pierce the din like a needle through cloth. At each juncture, the mind's attention shapes the form of understanding.\n\nMemory, the keeper of the past, holds the key to the brain's processing. Here, the moments of life are encoded, stored, and maintained within the mind's labyrinth. In the flicker of an instant, sensory memory captures the world. Working memory, ephemeral as the morning mist, holds its charge in the brief dance of electricity among neurons. Long-term memory, like ancient stones, is enshrined in the proteins that endure. Theories abound, each a map of the mind’s hidden geography. Some speak of networks and nodes, a web of connections that links ideas like stars in the night sky, where 'chair' finds kinship with 'table' and both to the living wood from which they were wrought.\n\nIn all this, we seek to understand the unknowable, to map the vast and silent corridors of the mind. And yet, for all our knowing, we remain as pilgrims on a road without end.",
            "In the year 2007, a shadow fell across the land of America. A financial tempest, unseen and unrestrained, spread its ruinous breath over the fortunes of men. Unemployment rose like some specter at the feast, the housing market a shambles, and the great engines of commerce lay broken in the dust. A recession took root and grew in that fertile desolation. And so we ask, how did it come to pass, and by what means might it be undone? The crisis was wrought by the folly of ambition, by the clumsy hands of governance that turned the wheels of finance until they spun themselves to the brink. Banks and firms, coaxed and cajoled, issued loans unfit for the soil they were planted in. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of underwriting, repackaged these mortgages into things unholy. With the borrowers fallen, the banks found their coffers bare, and so the contagion spread, a fire in the dry grasses, consuming all.\n\nIt began long before, in the year 1999, when the President sought to secure his place at the helm for another season. His administration, eager and heedless, loosened the bindings on lending, setting the stage for calamity. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of such things, a Cassandra to deaf ears. Fannie Mae, he wrote, was under the thumb of the Clinton administration, urged to extend its reach into the lower echelons of income, to feed the maw of growth. Ill winds, he foretold, would bring ruin in their wake, and so they did. The script was writ and the actors took their places.\n\nThe economy was a great ship, and its course was altered by many hands. Mortgages, once simple, had grown into beasts of complexity. Adjustable rates and securities backed by the fragile promise of payment. Collateralized debt like the chains of an ancient slave, binding one sector to another. The nation’s households, its markets, all lay overleveraged upon the altar of housing. A bubble swelled and burst, and the financial institutions, those pillars of trade, were laid low. Trillions in mortgage debts, a sum beyond reckoning, weighed upon them. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch fell to the hammer of necessity, Lehman Brothers scattered to the winds, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley remade themselves under the stern gaze of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with debts towering, were taken into the fold of government, a ward against their own collapse.",
            "In the quiet reaches of your tale, where the words stretch out like a desert, lies exposition. It waits, a beast of burden, to carry forth your narrative and yet it might just as likely lay your readers low, lost to dreams or the back button, shaking curses at your name as they retreat. Dr. Merlin, a soul not unfamiliar with the art of storytelling, has been heard to cast her ire at screens when ensnared in the coils of excessive discourse, and not the kind that warms the heart.\n\nExposition, this is not your ally.\n\nMy readers, those gentle souls, have heard the age-old counsel, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in passages where the world stands still or spins out of control. Exposition, that devil perched on your shoulder, whispers of history to be told, urging you to lay it bare before the tale can unfold to its true form. Do not confuse it with the other imp, urging you to recount every detail of each character's past from cradle to grave.\n\nExposition means recounting the past, often in simple prose. In the realm of film, it is the moment where one soul turns to another and spills forth the ballast of the tale like the mariner of old. In fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nConsider this: within the weave of a story, the heroine finds her love, the union is celebrated with grand flourish, and yet he meets his end before her very eyes—this all told in a page or two, their words few and far between. Yet you would expect more of the husband, to see in him through speech and manner the depth of his love. Equally, you would hope to glimpse in her gestures the changes wrought by his presence, the light he cast upon her world. Such would draw you into their lives, their bond, and their loss, binding you to the heroine in her grief.\n\nIn essence, you seek the flesh upon the skeletal tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must weave that flesh. There is the urge to hasten past it all. Perhaps you're sketching a new figure—a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman in his heart, dreaming one day to own that very station, the taste of Eggs Benedict still on his tongue.",
            "In the flickering light of morning, the day's first news from Columbus broke like a distant storm, unbidden and raw. The voice spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, a name now etched in the annals of violence for the stabbing of his wife. The screen flickered with his visage, a face that seemed carved from some dark stone, malevolent and unyielding. Yet, the tale was brief, a mere wisp of time devoted to its unfolding, as if the gravity of the act was yet to settle upon the world.\n\nThe morning's second tale emerged like a shadow, the story of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, struck down in the Sharon Woods as the dawn struggled to break. Critically wounded, nameless in the chaos, with no hand held accountable. The SWAT team prowled the edges of this mystery, but the story itself seemed to pass like a ghost in the early air. The specter of neglect hovered there, a familiar refrain where the blood of minorities often fades too swiftly from the public eye. If it were another child, one of lighter skin, the clamor would rise to the heavens. Yet here, the silence was palpable.\n\nThen came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, pierced by a bullet's whisper, the place of its wounding unknown. A .22 caliber rifle, the voice said, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of reward, a sum of five thousand for the soul who might bring justice to bear. But this too was fleeting, a mere moment in the continuum of the broadcast.\n\nThe sky threatened rain, the forecasters spoke, and storms were promised for the afternoon, a brief interlude of tempests amid the heat of the weekend. Such was the brevity of this tale, a lure to hold the listener's ear.\n\nThe tale of the Clime Road UDF robbery followed, the description of a man cloaked in shadow, a dark-skinned black man swathed in a hoodie. The words lingered over his complexion, a curious fixation upon his shade as if the darkness itself was a part of the crime.\n\nLastly, there came the story of Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in hushed tones, a kingpin of drugs from the sun-hardened plains of Texas. A conspiracy laid bare, marijuana flowing northward to Ohio. The sentence was spoken in months, three hundred of them, as if to stretch the years into eternity. The fact of his Hispanic heritage was mentioned, an extraneous detail, perhaps, yet there it was, woven into the fabric of the story like a thread of shadow.\n\nAnd so, the day wore on, each tale a fragment of the world, echoing into the silence beyond the screen.",
            "In the world of financial instruments, an ETF—known as an exchange traded fund—moves like a shadow in the market, tethered to the pulse of an index or perhaps a commodity, or a collection of assets as an index fund might, yet it bears the nimbleness of a stock. It offers the broad horizon of an index while granting the focused power of a single stock—a means to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim as little as a singular share in any given transaction. Such enticements draw many to them, yet ETFs whisper of lower expense ratios than the common mutual fund. The path is not without its thorns, for to tread in the realm of ETFs is to pay a commission each time, akin to any stock venture. Yet the landscape is vast, with a multitude of funds to choose from. Despite these clear enticements, the prudent investor must always discern if the promised spread of diversification truly exists and to what extent, like a prospector sifting through sand for gold. \n\nTo this end, we cast our gaze upon ETF IHF, examining it against the top ten holdings within its confines, seeking to ascertain if the fruits of a singular ETF can mirror the bounty of owning a scattered portfolio of those ten stocks, or if another configuration might yield a sharper ratio or greater return. Yet to avoid the cumbersome task of considering each holding, we shall limit ourselves to the foremost ten, which account for 63.58% of the ETF’s assets. Below, the top ten holdings stand, each with its share of the whole.\n\nTo grasp how these stocks stand as a reflection of the ETF IHF, we turn to the current percentage of assets, recalibrated to a full hundred, to measure each stock's weight in the portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were solely these ten stocks, each in the proportion ordained by their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the table below.\n\nFrom this table, it becomes clear: a portfolio of just these top ten holdings brings forth a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a rise of 16% in gains. A further revelation shows the Beta of these ten holdings sits .12 beneath that of the ETF entire. Thus, it appears that a portfolio crafted from these top ten might deliver higher returns at a lower beta. Yet, shadows remain, for these portfolios might not differ statistically in their means.\n\nTo discern this mystery, we delve into the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, recalibrated to a full hundred, to weigh their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "The days turned cold and the sun cast a weary light over the campus in that New England clime. With winter's grasp, the numbers fell away, those commuter logs dwindling like leaves from the trees. It was as if the very spirit of the venture had fled. Folks, wrapped in their old coats and scarves, trudged through December, their thoughts elsewhere. The semester's end loomed like a heavy curtain, and the minds of men and women were consumed with tasks that bore them down. The logs, neglected, faded from view, lost amid the noise of closing books and ringing bells. Holidays arrived with their own demands, and the campus lay silent, a ghost of its former self. \n\nJanuary returned with its promise of new beginnings, but the cold yet held sway, and the logs remained few. February came and went, a mystery unsolved, like tracks in the snow that lead nowhere. The initial fervor had passed, leaving only the quiet echo of what once was. March brought with it a challenge, a call to arms—Carpool Week, they named it—a final attempt to stir the embers, to coax life back into the forgotten cause. And for a time, it seemed to work. Yet the struggle was ever present, the battle against the lull of holidays and the rhythm of the academic year.\n\nIn truth, the heart of the matter lay deeper still. The open road had a hold on them, the freedom of the wheel and the solitude of a car’s cabin. It was a part of who they were, ingrained in their very bones. To lure them away required more than just good intention. Prizes were given, tokens of gratitude for those who took the road less traveled. But the prizes themselves were humble, perhaps too much so. The thought lingered of what might have been, a bicycle or an electric car, something grand to draw them in. Had the stakes risen with each passing month, perhaps the story would have unfolded differently. Yet, as it stood, the gifts remained small, and the numbers told their tale. The path forward lay uncertain, like a road disappearing into the mist.",
            "In the dim archives of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I found myself drawn to the flickering remnants of early Edison films. I resolved to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, those fifteen pieces spun between 1895 and 1901, each a testament to the nascent art of illusion born from the silent frames of celluloid. These films, with their beguiling craft, leaned upon the sleight of hand that clever editing could conjure. My study was a quiet unraveling of the poetics that defined most of these trick films, and a probing glance at those few among them that stood apart in their evolutionary stride, daring to breach the constraints of their era. \n\nIn that twilight of the century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, bound to its place, framed within the rigid proscenium like a prisoner in a cell. The camera, steadfast and unyielding, would not shift its gaze to follow the players upon the stage. The choreography was borrowed from the theater, an echo of vaudeville and the conjurer’s art. Movement was confined to the narrow line between the wings, never toward or away from the audience. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, circa 1900, where figures drift across the frame from right to left, never venturing into the depth of the scene. Even as they fade from view, the camera remains oblivious, anchored to its post.\n\nThe proscenium style cast its spell over the composition, dictating that all shots were long, and at times, medium. Close-ups were absent, unseen in the early Edison catalog, for the tradition was born of the theater where a spectator embraced the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's limits. Actors were stranded in the middle ground, distant from the lens, and thus, the intimacy of close-up was a stranger to these early frames.\n\nIn the infancy of the trick film, it was customary that a single shot would encompass the entirety of a film’s vision. The narrative was a fleeting wisp, constrained to mere seconds, dictated by the relentless ticking of the frames. Stories were sparse, mere whispers of vaudeville trickery—magic acts, disappearing acts—devoid of tale or drama. Yet, within this constraint lay a subtle deceit. The illusion of a singular shot belied the hidden seams where frames were stitched together to conjure apparitions or vanishing acts. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from the year 1895. Look closely, and the ruse reveals itself—the moment where Mary’s severed “head” joins the physical reel, though to the eye of the beholder, it remains a single unbroken vision.",
            "In those days when the Gothic novel found its first breath, it was as if the old world had birthed something new and strange, an odd marriage of contradictions. Ian Watt spoke of it, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his musings on the birth of this peculiar genre. It was both dismissed and exalted, this mode of writing, spoken of with disdain for lack of depth and yet revered for the 'terrible sublime' it seemed to conjure, as Burke might have noted. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto was the harbinger, binding the ancient with the modern, forging a path for those who would follow. In it, he took the old theatrical ways and wove them with the mimicry of nature that marked the novels of his time, creating what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe Gothic form was a refuge for relics of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. Even as Walpole penned his tale, the word \"gothic\" was a mutable thing, a descriptor that had been thrown at various peoples, styles, and ages, seen as something archaic and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modern progress. Yet this melding of the theatrical with the novel form, which let a reader peer into the minds of characters, gave the Gothic its longevity, making it a relic and a revelation at once to readers long removed from its origin.\n\nAmong the Gothic's echoes was the notion of Chivalry, that ancient code of the knight, a concept both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held weight for the Gothic scribes for what it symbolized—the knight of old, brave and true—and against the perceived decay of such ideals in the society they knew. The chivalric became romanticized, a glimpse backward to guide the present, perhaps even foreshadowing the Romantic to come. Walpole, writing in troubled times, saw shadows in the future and perhaps lamented a loss of virtue among his contemporaries. In his story, Frederic stands as a figure shaped by these ideals. Before Frederic steps forth, his presence is felt, a prince of chivalry, marred by tragedy and believed felled by infidels. He looms as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" exaggerated in form, foreshadowing the Gothic's love of excess. The characters breathe this chivalric air, and in them, Walpole's longing for an ideal lost is made manifest.",
            "In the quiet backwaters of commerce, the lifeblood of trade flows unseen from the moment a customer's need takes shape to the time it becomes a tangible reality. This procession, known as supply chain management, weaves its way through raw beginnings, through the sinews of supply, through the heart of production, and outward to the wide world of distribution. It was in the year 1982 that Keith Oliver, a man with the eyes of a seer and the mind of a tactician, gave this journey a name, a framework upon which the needs of man might be met with speed and precision. He spoke of it as a grand orchestration, a series of steps to be laid down with care and foresight.\n\nSix pillars uphold this structure, each as vital as the next: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools with which the stewards of industry craft their promises to the waiting world.\n\nIt begins with production, the genesis of all that follows. Here, the questions of when and why, of where and how, find their answers. Managers, like watchful shepherds, must discern the desires of their flock. The market, in its ceaseless ebb and flow, whispers its secrets to those who listen. With understanding comes decision, the what and the how many, the where and the which. The place of creation must be chosen with an eye to both the quantity and the quality demanded by those who wait. Schedules must be woven with the threads of time, and the machines made ready for their relentless toil. In this dance of creation, every step is crucial, for any misstep may squander both time and treasure.\n\nI have seen this with my own eyes, in the vast halls of Wal-Mart and Target. There, every aspect of the enterprise is set down, a script for the actors in this grand performance. From the attire of the laborer to the receipt of goods from distant lands, all is ordered, all is known. Such clarity breeds efficiency, and through it, the gears of business turn without the friction of uncertainty.\n\nNext comes supply, the lifeline upon which the success of all rests. It is a realm of choices, of which capabilities to nurture and which to entrust to others. A single product may have many paths to its creation, each with its own tools and hands, its own artistry. The manager, with the wisdom of Solomon, must choose the path that best serves the whole. And sometimes, the path leads outward, to partners beyond the walls of the company. This is done for the sake of speed, of velocity, the alchemy that turns quality into affordability, that renders the impossible possible.\n\nThese are the elements, the bones upon which the flesh of commerce is hung. And in their proper alignment, they carry forth the promise of fulfillment to the waiting world.",
            "The Victorian novels, with their meticulous attention to the minutiae of life and their devotion to the tales of the aristocracy, stand as monuments to an age now faded. Yet within this tapestry of gilded words, two stories emerge that diverge from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These tales, shrouded in mystery and tinged with the bizarre, reach beyond the conventional, drawing forth the very essence of their characters and laying bare the motives and emotions that drive them.\n\nAn uneasy consciousness shadowed Oliver, a specter of pain and fear that never ceased its torment. He walked as if in a dream, caught between the harsh voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words echoing in his mind. The sudden crack of gunfire jarred him, and he was swept away by unseen hands, lost in a tumult of cries and shouts, lights flaring before his eyes—a cacophony of chaos that blurred the lines of reality. In these visions, his powerlessness was laid bare, his senses dulled, his fate not his own. The shooting, a specter relived in his dreams, underscored his lack of control, his life teetering on the brink, held in the grip of forces beyond his ken. The hand of old Fagin, ever-present, seemed to tighten its hold, bending Oliver's will to despair, a slow breaking of spirit that left him unable to muster even the faintest resistance.\n\nThe day slipped away, a fleeting ghost swallowed by night, a night stretched thin with silence yet swift in its passing. Time, elusive and intangible, flowed through the dark hours, leaving behind only the residue of dreams and the shadows of what might have been.",
            "A few years past, I found myself in the company of children, guiding them through the tangled thickets of learning. It was an after-school program, a place where young minds grappled with the lessons of the day. My hands were strongest in the realms of English and reading, and it was there I was called upon to aid a boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps in the third or fourth grade, and he struggled mightily with the written word.\n\nThere was something amiss, I knew. The boy could speak as well as any, yet when it came to the letters on the page, he faltered. Some letters he could sound out clear as a bell, others eluded him entirely. It was a curious thing. Adrian was of Latino descent, that much was plain, but his English was flawless. We stumbled along together until the day his mother appeared. \n\nI was minding a few stragglers while the others ventured on a field trip when she walked in. Adrian’s mother spoke not a word of English, her tongue Spanish alone. With my halting Spanish, we managed a conversation of sorts. And then it struck me, like a sudden clap of thunder: Adrian's trouble lay not in reading, but in the English alphabet itself. It was a revelation, and whether it helped him then I cannot say, but I hold a hope that he fares better now.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the language barriers that rise like great walls in our schools, here in California and beyond. It is not always as it seems, this obstacle of language. Even a child who speaks English with ease may find its written form an immense challenge. So what path do we walk to remedy this? In Adrian’s case, a simple tutoring of letters and sounds sufficed. But for those who speak little English, the way is more convoluted. There is no single remedy. A blend of methods—dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—each plays its part.\n\nThe dual language system holds promise, not just for those whose native tongue is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this idea, a fear that it squanders resources, that most children gain nothing. But this is false. Were we to make such programs the rule rather than the exception, all would benefit. But how to achieve this? Demanding all teachers be bilingual is a step too far, a dream too distant. Yet, there is no reason we cannot employ aides or tutors who are, to guide this journey.",
            "From the time we draw breath, we are told of things larger than ourselves, of vastness beyond grasp, of mysteries that lace the world like shadows in the night. We are sent to learn of these things in places of worship or introspection, to seek answers that others have sought before us. Many of us accept the stories handed down from our forebears, as one might inherit a keepsake tarnished with time. Yet some of us, in our rebellion or despair, deny these stories, claiming there is nothing beyond the borders of our own small worlds. We may embrace one set of beliefs only to cast them off like old clothes and don the new. In whatever way we tread, we seek to carve out a piece of ourselves with the chisel of our own notions of the divine. We wander, searching for a glimmer in the gloom to lead us from the shadows and into the light.\n\nA cardinal, he said, when I asked him the question. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless beat on the tin above us, and shared our silence like an old song. The rainwater coursed through the gutters, drowning the flowers that lined the porch, as if seeking to obliterate all trace of life. He looked out at the rain, his gaze a lost thing, caught between memory and dream. He had grown frail in those final months, his clothes hanging on him like ghosts of days past. His hair, once thick, had thinned, a whisper of what it was. He watched the rain still, as if in its falling he found some unspoken truth. I sat there with him, the words I could not say lodged in my throat, for to speak them would make them real. I moved closer, our chairs almost touching, and together we watched the rain fall in the twilight of that June evening.\n\nHe left us in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments had granted him a reprieve, a few more months, though at what cost I could not reckon. What god, I asked myself, allows such suffering? Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a god, I thought, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not want to watch him slip from this world to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the fading of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than the rest, better than those who watched over him at the end. He would not have wished for me to stand vigil at his passing. And so I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that came as quiet as a breath.\n\nBut no one called.",
            "In the long shadow of the Virginian fields where the earth holds its secrets and the sun beats down relentless as truth, there lived a man named John Taylor of Caroline. A man whose heart beat in time with the Republican dream and whose life was a testament to the soil and the sweat that it demands. An agrarian by blood and by belief, he walked the path of politics just long enough to carve his name into the stone of liberty, speaking out with a voice unyielding in matters of freedom and the reach of government. For Taylor, the land was sacred and the tilling of it a noble act upon which all else was built—his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the courts themselves rooted in this belief.\n\nThe land of the free held promise like an unbroken colt, wild and unencumbered by the chains of tradition. Taylor saw this vast expanse and in it the chance to craft a new covenant of governance. A place where the rights of a man stood as tall as the mountains and as unassailable as the stars. Each right a thread in the fabric of freedom, and if one were to fray, the whole would unravel, leaving nothing but the shadows of what once was. To Taylor, the state of nature was a place where the strong and the cunning held sway, a lawless land where might made right, but this was not to be the way of civilization.\n\nIn the crafting of this society, Taylor held firm to the belief that a government must embrace the duality of man, the light and the dark that reside in every soul. His words were as stern as the rocks of the riverbed, declaring that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles, he claimed, were the guardians of property and the stewards of the fields, standing in defiance of the encroaching tide of capitalism. A government grounded in such principles would remain true, no matter the greed and ambition of those who ruled. For self-interest was the compass by which man navigated, its morality judged by whether it served the common good or the selfish few. It was a good government that could harness this nature, but always under the watchful eye lest it stray into corruption.\n\nAmong the Republicans, Taylor stood resolute, calling for the Constitution to be held like scripture, its words binding and its powers limited. The Federal government, a beast that must be kept lean and its reach short, for fear of despotism lurking in the shadows of its ambition. Yet, he knew too that words alone were not enough. Their true meaning lay in the hearts of those who penned them, and without such understanding, the letter of the law could twist into tyranny. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true lodestar of the nation, a testament to a union of states, each sovereign and strong, rather than a single, monolithic entity.\n\nAnd so, John Taylor of Caroline stood, a solitary figure against the horizon, his life a testament to the land he loved and the freedoms he cherished, a voice echoing across the ages, calling us back to the principles upon which this nation was built.",
            "Downward he gazed, mind adrift in the empty fathom of the sight laid before him. Without a sound, without the stirrings of emotion, he beheld with an awareness honed over time, an awareness that dissected yet refused to tie the dissected parts to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted into his consciousness and then away, as if borne on some invisible current, too swift to grasp, too elusive to own. Such was the smooth, seamless dance of his faculties that it seemed he had no thoughts to claim as his own, merely a fluid engagement with what lay in his gaze.  \n\nOnce upon counsel from an artist of his acquaintance, he acquired a tome on the craft titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, the desire to learn the art of drawing had clung to him, and this book promised to unveil the secrets—from the essence of a pencil to the brain's alchemy of line and form. One lesson it offered was the use of a square frame to isolate the artist's subject. Thus, a chaotic tableau, a fruit bowl ensconced in a kitchen that opens into a dining room, could be distilled into a singular, manageable vision, that bowl of fruit centered on its simple plane.  \n\nYet there he stood, eyes fixed upon the bowl before him, unable to summon that artist's frame. Overcome, awestruck, he could only stand and marvel in silence. Picasso had his blue period; Monet reveled in verdant hues; the Italian Renaissance masters painted with a spectrum unbounded. Should he dare to claim his view as Artistic, there before him lay the embryo of his creation, the dawn of his narrative, his Work in Brown.  \n\nHis fingertips alighted on his chosen tool of creation, sinews tensed and released, his hand traversing the space between, his mind's resolve shaping itself in what might have been the most creative act of his existence. Water swirled, tranquil and unblemished, clear as crystal. Bits of matter departed from the whole, carried off to oblivion. Muscles tensed anew, twitching with impatience and resolve, his hand struck the toilet handle once more. The obstinate brown mass refused to yield, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain bottom.  \n\nMop held loosely in hand, feet braced a foot apart, the green tie tight around his neck, he frowned slightly at the insolent mass of processed life left as a testament to those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silent contemplation, then his hand reached for the wall to his right, seized the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it was swathed like an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended slowly into the bowl, akin to a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the dusk of a world where youth takes the wheel too soon, there is a grim tally of lives lost among those who are yet to see the fullness of their days. The young drivers of America, bound by the chains of their own inexperience and the unripe nature of their minds, find themselves adrift on the highways of a perilous freedom. The National Institutes of Health speak of brains unfinished, of instincts not yet honed to the sharpness demanded by the unyielding road. Their hands, unsteady upon the wheel, steer them into the shadows of tragedy. \n\nIt is not the solitary road that claims them, but the presence of their peers beside them, the laughter and the clamor of youth unchecked. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has studied this dance of folly and found that with each young soul added to the vehicle, the specters of accident and ruin draw closer.\n\nIn the sunlit halls of governance, California and its kin have sought to lay down laws to shepherd these fledgling drivers, to bind them with provisional licenses that restrict their passage through the night and forbid the company of their fellows. Yet these are but frail barriers against the tide of statistics that mark the youngest among us as unfit for the burdens they bear. \n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze upon the reckless heart of youth and finds even eighteen too tender an age for such heavy responsibility. USA Today whispers of his research, of the youthful thirst for danger that does not abate until the years have tempered it. To delay the granting of license until this wildness subsides would be wisdom, a shield against the impending toll. For the day approaches when the offspring of the Baby Boomers will flood the roads, a legion of potential peril.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this plight would not be a tangled affair. Schools could continue their teachings, sowing the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day earn the right to drive. But none under eighteen would take the wheel alone. A provisional phase would still precede the full rite of passage, and the hours of practice would remain—a number forged from the common practices of the states, such as the six hours behind the wheel and fifty hours with a guide that California demands.\n\nThe need for a unified, national decree is clear, for the specter of youth lost on the road is not confined to one land or another. It is a plight that demands a single voice, a singular act of protection for all who would step into the realm of the driver. This is not a new thought, but it is one whose time is come.",
            "In the quiet of the mind's labyrinth, where sounds are more than mere echoes, lies the enigma of Central Auditory Processing Disorder. It is a disorder not of the ear's hearing but of the brain's understanding. The disorder, known as CAPD or APD, speaks to the inefficiency of the central nervous system in translating the world of sound. Sounds that are clear as day to the ear become lost in the shadowed corridors of the mind, where words blend and noises become an indistinguishable hum. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association tells us that it is the perceptual processing of auditory information that falters, leaving the afflicted adrift in a sea of sound without a compass.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder, then called \"auditory imperception,\" came in the mid-1950s. Researchers, like wanderers in a dark wood, began to uncover the disorder's path. It was an Italian team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who first laid the stones for this path in 1954. Then came Kimura in 1961, with dichotic testing and a model to illuminate the physiology of the auditory system, like a lantern casting its light into the dark. By 1977, a conference gathered the minds of the time, sparking a flame of inquiry into the disorder that would be known as CAPD.\n\nThe disorder wears many faces. It is the inability to locate sound in space, a voice calling out but its source unknown. It is the muddling of acoustic events, two sounds that become one. It is the failure to recognize sound patterns, the music of the world reduced to a cacophony. It is the loss of speech's subtleties, sarcasm slipping past unnoticed. A sound blocked by another, an auditory puzzle unsolved. The clues that are heard but not understood, the sequence of sound lost in the shuffle. These are the hallmarks of CAPD.\n\nDiagnosis is a journey through observation and testing, a path walked by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. It is a landscape of questionnaires and surveys, where the patient's auditory behaviors are observed like a distant horizon. There is no single map, no consistent test to diagnose with certainty, and the cause remains elusive. Tests abound, challenging the patient to pick out words from a chorus, numbers from a din. Advanced tests peer into the ear, measuring the mind's response to the signals it receives.\n\nIn the end, the disorder remains a shadow on the mind, a whisper in the dark. It is a journey for the teachers who guide these children, to light their way in the mainstreamed classroom, to help them find their place in the world of sound.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, I find myself drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I aim to bring solace to children battered by life's cruelties and to offer a hand to families adrift in turmoil. I carry with me certain values, simple yet weighty: service, respect, an ethical spirit, a steadfastness to mend the ties between souls, and an unwavering resolve to hone my own craft, to remain ever adept in my chosen path. These are not mere tenets of the trade; they are the marrow of my being.\n\nThere was a time when the path lay shrouded, and I wandered in uncertainty. Yet always did I harbor a yearning to aid others. Through the corridors of high school and college, I witnessed many who turned their backs on woes that shadowed them, a few embracing poor crutches as their companions. It was in the face of such scenes that I turned to the study of the mind, seeking a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still, the path ahead remained obscured, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer’s day, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxiously on a couch, seeking refuge from the hands of his tormentors—his own kin. The next day he summoned the law to his home, and I, feeling the stirring within, went to see if I could be of aid. I spoke with the officers, sharing my recent schooling in Psychology. With the law’s limitations laid bare, they asked me to speak with the boy’s parents. In their presence, I found a pair cloaked in unease, their words mere smokescreens for their actions, painting their child as manipulative for seeking outside aid in resolving what they deemed \"simple\" disputes. It was then that the path of social work began to take shape before me, a calling to untangle such \"simple\" knots within the fabric of family life.\n\nAnother stone in the foundation of social work is the pursuit of social justice. In these times, society holds the individual to a pedestal, yet mourns those lost to the ages without truly understanding the essence of uniqueness. We profess the value of the individual, yet strive to mirror the many. I am but one, yet I resist the chains that seek to bind me to others' molds. Throughout my schooling, I stood against the tides of social injustice—my hair colored with defiance, my clothing a testament to self, my ears pierced beyond the ordinary. I pledged allegiance with the GSBA, fighting the specters of racism and discrimination wherever they reared their heads. I am a believer in social justice, and my protest against injustice shall not cease.",
            "In the bleak corridors of human understanding, where shadows cast by science and society meet, there lies the discourse on insomnia. Here, the biological and sociocultural models stand as sentinels, each offering its own fractured light upon the disorder. The biological tale is one of inheritance and the silent whispers of genes. The sociocultural tale speaks of the world's weight, of race and class and the myriad ties that bind a soul to its place in the order of things. What follows is an examination of insomnia through these dual lenses, a weaving of research threads that seek to unravel the intricacies of disorder. Each study, each finding laid bare, is scrutinized for its truths and its failings.\n\nSleep, that elusive balm, can be troubled in many forms. The mind, restless and unyielding, may birth its own demons. Or perhaps the body, through the ravages of substance or malady, refuses the peace of slumber. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to the specters that haunt the night. Insomnia, that failure to find rest, and its counterpart, hypersomnia, the struggle to stay awake. Narcolepsy, where dreams intrude unbidden upon the waking world. These disorders, each with its own dark signature, are the focus here, particularly insomnia, viewed through the lens of the biological and sociocultural.\n\nIn the realm of biology, the story unfolds in the silent workings of neurons, the dance of chemicals and the legacy of genes. Within the hypothalamus, orexin neurons hold sway over the tides of sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice, creatures of the night, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors, guardians of slumber. The activation of these receptors, a gentle push toward sleep, a lesson learned from the simple creatures that scurry beneath the moon's gaze. The implication, a whisper that the same truths might hold for humans, that these receptors, inherited or altered, could govern a person's journey into the night. \n\nYet, the sociocultural tale is a different one, a tale of inheritance not just of genes but of circumstance. The world, with its relentless demands, its school and work and the mundane tasks that make up a life, would bear heavily on those whose sleep is disturbed. For the absence of rest is a thief, robbing focus and sapping strength, a burden carried through the long gray hours of day. Thus, insomnia stands at the crossroads of biology and society, a testament to the complex weave of human existence.",
            "I have wandered these grounds of University Park for what now counts as two and a half years, or four and a half semesters by the reckoning of the calendar, and the journey across this sprawling campus is no small matter. In the days of my freshman year, they put me up in a room at East Halls, cast away at the eastern fringe of this academic world, beyond which lies the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From my home in Stuart Hall to the distant halls of learning like Willard building, set near the heart of campus, it could be a long, cold march of twenty-five minutes on foot, especially when the State College weather conspired against me. \n\nI spoke with an alum, not many years my senior, who told of times when East Halls were isolated by vast swathes of unused earth. Those empty lands now brim with sports fields and grand new edifices, the Creamery, and a building for health services, encircled by apartments. The campus swells, and with its growth, the task of traversing it becomes more onerous. What remedy for this plight of movement? On a college ground, it is the bicycle that offers salvation. Yet a bicycle alone is naught without the riders and a campus molded to their needs.\n\nA friend of mine, returned to the bicycle after years of neglect, mused why he ever forsook it. \"Bikes are a boon,\" he said. \"For a time, the fashion turned against them, but they are the only way to roam.\" Beyond the boon to body and health, cycling stands as the swiftest means of passage. A bowl of oatmeal and the strength of your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. Like others of my kind, I dwell off campus now, a distance from the center akin to that of some dorms. The wisest choice I made this year was to claim a bicycle as my own. Every day, I am called to class in Thomas building, a journey of twenty-five minutes on foot from my abode. With a bicycle, that time is cut to five minutes if I push hard enough. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, poses its own challenges for those on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, but time is a scarce commodity. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas daily would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my day. Over a week, that sums to more than two and a half hours. Add to that the minutes spent on other walks to classes, meetings, and so forth. It is time I cannot afford to lose.",
            "In the dim corridors of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley casts a shadow over the march of technology and the capitalist edifice that props it, painting a landscape barren and stark with the specter of a dystopia. Within those pages, the souls that tread do so in the name of community, a unity forged at the cost of the self, each mind conditioned from the cradle to chase the hollow echo of immediate joy. They wander, these denizens, as pieces upon a board unseen, their paths carved by the unseen hand of the World Controller, an architect of their singular creed. Glance through the pane of Marxist theism and see the author’s wariness laid bare, a distrust threaded through the loom of those burgeoning systems. Terms of Marxist discourse—homogeny, reification—stand as sentinels, whispering Huxley’s cautionary tale of the economy’s birth pangs from his epoch’s womb.\n\nCapitalism stands mocked, a parody spun from the Marxist cloth of false consciousness. Herein, the common folk wander blind to the ties binding them to other castes in commerce’s dance, their eyes fixed upon their own reflections. Such blindness, borne of ideological chains, grips the proletariat and laborers, stark in the somnolent conditioning of Brave New World’s people. Deltas and Gammas, puppets all, driven by hypnopædia’s relentless chant to consume, to squander, to revel, a chorus orchestrated by the World Controller. The specter of hegemony looms, a dominion of one class over others, complete and unyielding. The lower castes remain in the dark, complicit in their own deception, bartering their souls for the gilded cage of capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, Alphas, Betas, with eyes open yet closed, content in their gilded chains, save for the few voices like Bernard, who dare to question the chains that bind. The interplay of these classes, as shall be unraveled, speaks to the fetters of capitalism’s grip.\n\nIn this world, true connections wither and die. Brave New World sketches its characters as shadows, bereft of life’s depth and color. Huxley hints at a truth: the twin specters of advancing technology and capitalism strip man of will and voice. Love’s flame is snuffed, and the spectrum of emotion dims to gray. Interactions drift upon the surface, men’s words of women reduced to flesh alone, women’s tales of encounters laid bare without shame. Complacency with their lot marks each class, testament to capitalism’s socioeconomic toll. Their unwavering march within the community’s bounds echoes Marxist thought—the proletariat, lulled into believing their dominion, while they consume, while they obey, while they march in lockstep with destiny’s decree.",
            "It was near four years gone when I took to studying the ways of Islam at the college. There in the room of learning, we did argue and debate over the nature of this faith, whether it bore any malice upon the world. It seems to me now, in these days of shadow and remembrance, that such a question holds more weight than at any time before. Since the towers fell and the earth trembled, I have seen the gaze of the world shift from one of suspicion towards Islam to a strange kind of acceptance within the lands of America. I reckon back in the year of 2001, the thought of a man called Barack Obama, with his roots tangled in the soil of the Muslim world, rising to seek the nation's highest seat would have been a notion met with disbelief.\n\nThe tale of the Prophet draws me in, for it is a curious thing, this recounting of Muhammad’s life, which seems to stand apart from the man himself as history has told it to me. I had thought him a conqueror, bending tribes to his will and faith by the sword’s edge. Yet, the story presents him as a martyr misunderstood, one who bore humility and whom others came to follow of their own accord, seeking the light in his words.\n\nThere are tales within that speak of wonders, akin to those of Jesus, and they sit uneasy with me. Like when Muhammad took the mutton and the milk and made it plenty for forty hungry souls. It seems to me the writers wished to paint him as a prophet of humble truth, content in his miracles. Yet, such writings seem to diminish the miracles of Christ, as though they would steal from His life and deeds to crown another.\n\nThe stories are many, and they speak of those who found their way to Islam, tales told through the voices of others, whispered down the line from one to another. And yet, I find this manner of storytelling suspect, for it seeks to lend weight to the truth yet strips the tales of their own.\n\nWhat stirs unrest within me is this effort to raise Muhammad as a man of gentle spirit and grace. But the annals of time tell a different story, one of power and conquest. I wonder if those who follow him now truly know the path he walked to claim his place in the world.",
            "The world turns and the teachings of the Nazarene linger as a whisper among the windswept plains of time. From his life onward, the course of Christian thought charted a path away from its original shores. In the wide arc of history, a drift is seen. A gulf that grows between the past and the present. The world today dances with a new awareness, a progress that moves in tides uncharted. Yet there are those who clutch to the old ways, who stand rooted as if against a storm, unmoved by the winds of change. They are few, their voices thin in the vast choir of time. Among believers, a hunger stirs. A thirst to peel back the years, to sift the truth from the dust of doctrines layered thick by time. It may take long years, decades, even centuries, but the wheel will turn. A great reversion will come. The march of history will bend back upon itself. A movement like the tide will rise, cleansing the layers of doctrine, stripping away the years until only the bare truth remains. That which the Nazarene spoke to the world. When this tide sweeps through lands, through the cities of the West, a new worship will rise. Pure and unadorned. And the church, the great institution, will stand as a beacon. Yet as the clock rewinds, a strange thing will happen. Diversity will give way, yielding to a sameness of belief and practice. Across the lands and seas, among the many sects, the differences will wane. Human history knows such reversals. Once, the Christians were hunted, shunned, slain by the might of Rome. Yet in time, Rome itself bowed to the cross. Our own nation walked the long road from chains to leadership. So it will be in the realm of faith. A return to the source, a stripping away of the years. And all this will hinge on a new understanding of the Nazarene's words. Not as fixed and solid, but as fluid, as metaphor. So what has been wrought since his time? Look far enough and you find only the roots of Judaism, the seedbed of Christian faith. A single God, the revealed word, the authority of the ancient texts. Such was the heart of faith when Rome laid its hand upon Jerusalem. Yet within the Jewish fold, there was division. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the silent majority. Each a voice in an ancient chorus, each a thread in the tapestry of time.",
            "The world laid out in the pages of The Jungle is a testament to the dark and immutable greed that seeps through the veins of men. In the dim corridors of their hearts, there is but a hunger to sate their own desires, to carve out a slice of life that is theirs alone, heedless of the cries of those beneath them. Sinclair's narrative is a grim tapestry woven with the threads of ambition and indifference, its loom the great factories that rise like monoliths over the landscape, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke that stain the sky and the earth below. The owners, the managers, are architects of ruin, their vision tunneled and blind to the suffering that trails in their wake. In Sinclair's own words, the skyline is marred by these edifices of industry, the smoke a testament to the disregard they hold for life, human or otherwise.\n\nWithin the bowels of these factories, men are but cogs in a relentless machine, their worth measured in dollars and discarded when their usefulness wanes. The seething cauldron of jealousy and spite is their world, a place where loyalty is a currency long spent and decency an echo of something lost. Workers toil through hours that stretch like shadows, only to be cast aside without warning, their livelihoods snatched away by the whims of those who see them as nothing more than numbers on a ledger. In those times, the law held no solace for the laborer; the world was a wild place where power was unchecked and men were driven to the brink by the demands of progress.\n\nYet Sinclair's tale does not speak it plain; it is a whisper through the clamor of industry that the souls who labored and perished in Packingtown were bound to endure the misery thrust upon them. No savior came in the form of agency or organization to lend them aid, only the hollow promise of unions that fed upon the very lifeblood they claimed to protect. Trapped in a cycle as unforgiving as the machines they served, they were likened to slaves of old, their chains forged by hunger and desperation. A population teetering on the edge of starvation, their lives held ransom by men as ruthless as any slaver, their fates entwined with the capriciousness of those who held the reins of power. Immorality seeped into the very fabric of their existence, as inevitable as the dawn that broke over the smoke-choked horizon.",
            "In the darkened realm of literary echoes, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the shadows cast by those who came before. Thulé, a term that slips twice from the poet's quill, finds its roots tangled in the ancient lines of Virgil, whispered from the edge of the known world north of Britain. Yet, in the deepening dusk of his interests, Poe found allure in the Germanic whispers of Goethe’s voice. This affinity for Goethe's pen is not a mere shadow of imitation but a dialogue across the abyss of time, a kinship noted by Karl J. Arndt in his scholarly musings.\n\nGoethe, the architect of Faust's tragic saga, penned \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale heavy with the sorrow of a king, bereft of his queen, clutching a goblet as his sole companion. The king's life unwound like a dark fable, his possessions scattered to the winds save for that cup, which he cast into the sea before embracing his end. Such a spectral king, a reflection perhaps of Poe’s own lamentations and liquid solace, mirrors the landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" where color fades and dead friends haunt the lonely traveler.\n\nPoe’s invocation of Thule, once within the torture-wrought walls of \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice as the somber pillars of \"Dream-Land,\" speaks to a deeper kinship with Goethe's mournful monarch. The world Poe sketches is a shadow of Goethe's, a dreamscape where the living and the dead coexist in a twilight devoid of color. Here, Poe, like Goethe's king, wanders through a world dimmed by loss, where the echoes of a bygone life linger like a haunting refrain.\n\nGoethe’s presence in the literary firmament was one that Poe could not ignore, not only for Goethe’s own sake but through the light cast by Tennyson's reverence. In this tangled web of influence and respect, Poe found himself entwined with Goethe’s legacy, a legacy that had seeped into the fabric of the time, woven into countless retellings and adaptations. Thus, \"Dream-Land\" becomes not merely a poem but a bridge, a spectral dialogue with the past, where Poe and Goethe stand like twin phantoms on the edge of eternity.",
            "The sun had long since begun its descent behind the California hills and the aisles of the grocery lay in a kind of twilight. It was there, on the cold tiles, that the applesauce lay spilled like some forgotten offering to the gods of negligence. Could a customer, injured in such a fall, find justice in punitive damages by laying bare the heart of the store's keeper, who twice had been told of the spill and yet did nothing, choosing his meal over duty?\n\nThe law would not easily banish Jennifer Palmer’s claim to the shadows. For punitive damages to be just, one must show the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that might come, such conduct deemed despicable. Palmer would argue that Martin, the manager, should have known the danger of leaving the spill, for others had fallen before her in those very aisles. Despite this, he did not act. The argument that his actions were despicable is perhaps less strong, yet it holds some weight, for six slip-and-fall incidents scar the year 2009 alone, and still, Martin did not ensure the safety of his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, as the clock struck five, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with news of the spill. But Martin, deep in his dinner break, dismissed Wayne’s words like so much ash on the wind. A quarter-hour later, Mary J. Haddigan, another soldier of the store, brought the same news, and once again, Martin turned away. At half-past five, it was Jennifer Palmer who met the floor, her back taking the brunt of the fall. Five such incidents had been reported in that year before hers, and now Palmer seeks recompense from D&D for her pain, both compensatory and punitive, as we ponder the wisdom of seeking to cut short her pursuit of the latter.\n\nIn California, the path to punitive damages for a breach of duty not born of contract lies in proving “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So states Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, according to the statute, is harm intended, or if intent be absent, conduct deemed “despicable” carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” The courts have marked conduct as malicious if the defendant, aware of the probable danger his actions posed, willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt there was something she needed. A longing that refused to find its rest. It began when she was about fourteen, stepping into the tangle of teenage life. And it lingered still three years later at seventeen. By now she had come to know it was someone she sought, not something. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had tried, stumbling through awkward gestures to charm the uncharmable, but none captured her fancy. She puzzled over this odd notion, sifting through the reasons that might explain such a strange occurrence in a girl of her age. The years of pondering had yielded theories, but none strong enough to hold her speculation. So she moved through life, the question of her desires ever present.\n\nA day at home was typically a sanctuary of peace. Her parents were gentle, calm souls. They never quarreled with one another, and it was a rare thing to find any discord between them and their daughter. The only contention was her insistence on her independence and the free spirit she bore. A daughter to such a composed pair, she was nonetheless their opposite, her vibrant personality a counterpoint to their tranquility, yet she was well-loved for her kindness and the joy she brought.\n\nBut today was not a day of calm. As she moved from room to room, seeking some spark for her own musings, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen, her mother’s voice, usually so melodious, now strained. She rushed into the room, a thread of panic winding through her. \"Mom? Mom, what’s wrong?\" she cried. She found her mother on the floor, wincing, breath coming in short bursts as she muttered \"Ow\" with each exhalation. She dropped to her side, a hand reaching out to ease her. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to—the hospital.\" The words were pressed out, each one tight with pain. Her daughter, now the stalwart of the house, was thankful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital stood an edifice of disinfectant and dread, the air tinged with the tang of fear. But her mind was too occupied with the task at hand to notice. She bore her mother swiftly inside, calling for aid. Faces, furrowed with concern, gathered round as a bed on wheels was brought forth and her mother was eased onto it. They took her away to be seen to, leaving the daughter alone in her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a step stool, reaching for a vase that rested on the highest shelf they had.",
            "In the silence of the study, the light sifted through the blinds, casting long shadows across the pages of numbers and notes. This inquiry, like a lone rider on an endless plain, sought to uncover the ways of the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled but whispered of in the halls of medicine. Here, in the heart of the land, the aMed diet, a variant of its Mediterranean kin, called for a bounty of plants, their roots deep in the earth, and the sea’s own fish, while turning away from the flesh of beasts and the heavy fats they bore. Even the spirits were welcome, in modest measure, to join this dance of sustenance.\n\nThe records bore witness to tales of those who followed this diet, their risks of the grim fate of heart disease and stroke lessened, as if the diet were a shield against time's cruel hand. In the chronicles of past studies, the Med diet stood firm against the specter of death, its power proven more potent than the low-fat ways in the battle against the bulge and the war of the blood.\n\nThis tale unfolded over years, with 74,886 women, their lives a tapestry of health and habit, unwound through the careful lens of the Nurses' Health Study. From the year of 1984 to 2004, they walked this path, their steps recounted through the food frequency questionnaires, echoes of their daily bread. The faith of these women stood strong, with over 95 percent holding to their course across two decades. Their tales of heart and stroke were etched in records, each stroke and heart attack a line in the annals of medical lore.\n\nThe numbers were gathered, the aMed scores tallied, like the counting of stars in the night sky, to smooth the random and reveal the true path of their diet. Care was taken to clear the fog of confusion, adjusting for age and smoke and the many ways a life could tilt the scale.\n\nThrough the lens of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the story of the aMed score unfolded, revealing the path to lesser risks of heart and stroke. In two decades, the toll was counted: 2391 hearts faltered, 1763 strokes struck, and 1077 fell to the great silence of cardiovascular disease. Yet, those who adhered most closely to the diet’s tenets found themselves at less risk, as if the diet bore them through the storm, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those who strayed.\n\nThus, the Mediterranean diet whispered its promise, a promise of life and health amidst a world of shadow and decay.",
            "The sign stood stark against the drab horizon, a message scrawled in black ink that held the weight of a world gone mad. Hitler alive in Burma, it read. The girl beneath the sign, Ellen Page, star of a film once bright with youthful promise, stood alone on that street corner. Her face was a mask of quiet resolve, the cardboard a thin shield against the apathy of passersby. Burma, that distant land, a country known in the tongues of men as Myanmar, lay under the iron grip of a junta. They had seized power in '62, a coup d'état, a bloodless word for a bloody act. \n\nIn '07, the streets awoke. A decade of silence shattered by the voices of monks clad in saffron robes, their protests a revolution named for the color that cloaked them. The Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, the monks were allowed their peace—an uneasy peace—but soon the streets ran red. The military came down like a hammer, monasteries ransacked, and those who bore witness, journalists from lands afar, were caged or killed. Kenji Nagai, a name lost to the dust of September 27th, his crime merely to be there, to see. The death toll, they said, was thirteen. A number whispered by those who knew better to be thousands. Colonel Hla Win, a defector, spoke of it—a truth drowned in silence.\n\nBut this was no new story. The dance of power and dissent as old as the stones beneath their feet. Rome had its gods, emperors who ruled by divine right. Japan, with emperors deemed gods themselves, leading with iron and ritual, their legacy a tapestry of technology and tradition. In America, the president, George W. Bush, conversed with Ted Haggard, a man of strange convictions, in a world where absurdity and policy walked hand in hand.\n\nTiananmen, '89—a protest, a massacre, the numbers a shadow play of truth and fiction, the dead uncounted, unremembered. Rwanda in the '90s, a genocide that stained the earth, the Hutu against the Tutsi, a history written in blood. Hitler's Reich, the Third, a dark chapter where the world looked away as millions perished. All these, echoes of a past that refuses to die, haunting the edges of a world forever teetering on the brink.",
            "In the dim and shadowed corridors of jazz there stood a man whose name was Duke and whose music lay like a tapestry woven in the dark. His life long and his creations longer still, for in his hands the orchestra became a living thing, a beast of sound and silence. At the heart of it all, the piano’s voice was soft, a whisper in the gathering storm, yet it was his mind that shaped the tempest. The compositions chosen here tell tales of his craft, where each note was a thread and each musician a color in the fabric. He laid down the paths where the soloists wandered, free as birds in the evening sky, and he drew them back again to the tight embrace of his orchestrations, each piece a testament to their style and his vision. The orchestra was his canvas, the sounds he conjured were like none other, fitting each piece like a glove to a hand, each sound a testament to the mastery of the man who knew the soul of each player and how they sang together in the growing choir of his dreams. \n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks his name and mentions Creole Love Call, where the voice becomes an instrument and words are but shadows. It was here that Duke first wove voice into the tapestry, a rich color without the burden of lyrics. The piece stands as a monument to his ability to match the voice of his soloists to the song’s soul. It unfolds in six choruses, each a step in its journey:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response that echoes like voices in a canyon, the voice smooth and then rough like the wind through the trees.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet weaves its tale, bending notes like reeds in the water.  \nChorus 3: A clarinet's cry high and sweet, with the piano's soft syncopation beneath it.  \nChorus 4: The band a reflection of the first chorus, brass and reeds answering each other.  \nChorus 5: The piece's heart, where the high reeds call and the brass and rhythm respond in syncopated time.  \nChorus 6: A return to the beginning, voice and reeds in their dance, the voice now growling like some wild thing.  \nTag: A fleeting moment, a vocal run, the trombone's dissonance a final note.\n\nVoice as color, as texture, a thread in the fabric of his work, this was but one of his many gifts. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, the Duke mixed tight orchestration with the hues of tone color. A call and response, “Bubber” Miley’s trumpet muted, Baby Cox’s scat singing, each borrowing from the other, each a shadow and a light. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart in Duke's orchestra, gives the melody voice on his muted trombone, an extension of the ideas that lay within the Duke’s mind, ever reaching, ever seeking, forever crafting the music of the night.",
            "In the vast theater of existence, one question lingers in the shadows: why do living things shape themselves the way they do? Does some unseen hand guide their transformation, shackled by chains of limitation? It was in 1917 when D’Arcy Thompson mused, as if whispering to the void, that the zoologist had not yet dared to speak the simplest forms of life in the language of numbers. And still, the echo of that thought remains. Yet, in the quiet corridors of recent times, the mathematicians have turned their gaze upon the humble mollusk, tracing the lines of its shell through time's passage, both its youth and its lineage, seeking to unravel the mysteries therein.\n\nOur study, like a lone wanderer in the desert, seeks to harness the power of mathematical modeling, to peer deep into the heart of Prunum, to understand the forces that shape its journey through the ages. We look at the bones, the very structure of these creatures, through the ghostly images cast by X-rays, and from these, we draw the lines and numbers that will tell us of their past and their possible futures. These numbers, these whispers of existence, feed the hungry mind of the software CerioShell, as if it were a beast of the machine, and from it, we conjure the forms that might yet be.\n\nA shell, you see, is a tube, a tunnel through the void of time, spiraling in endless circles, a helix of life. Each turn, each whorl, is a dance around a phantom spine, the columella, the pillar of its being. The speed of this dance, this eternal spiral, is marked by sutures, the scars of its journey. And the grandest of these turns is the final one, the body whorl, the culmination of its life's voyage. Above it, the spire, a crown of all that came before, reaching ever upwards. The apex, the pinnacle, and below, the base, the foundation. From the shell's heart, the creature emerges, through the aperture, the gateway to the world.\n\nWe peer at their forms from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural—each view a different tale. To count the whorls, to unravel this spiral, one must begin at the top, discerning the first suture, drawing the line that splits the shell's story in twain. And from there, count the whorls, precise to the quarter turn, tracing the arc of life.\n\nA shell's journey is a series of apertures, a path carved through space and time, as the creature builds its home. One can map this journey, chart the course of the aperture, through coordinates and radii, both horizontal and vertical. This path, this trajectory, can be drawn upon paper, captured in the language of mathematics. And with that language, with those numbers, we can alter the course, manipulate the very making of the mollusk's shell.",
            "In the waiting shadow of a decade, the numbers stood still, unyielding. Neonatal and infant mortality, unmoved in the vast archipelago of Indonesia. The nation strides forth, meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, water and sanitation within reach, yet the specter of maternal and child health looms large, the goals for 2015 slipping further into the horizon. Herein, the reasons lie scattered like fallen leaves, pointing to the frailty of the health system, a call to fortify its bones rather than chase after fleeting interventions.\n\nThere's been progress, they say. Seventy-two percent of births now find themselves under the watchful eyes of skilled hands. Yet those hands include the midwives, the wise women of the village, who hold no scalpel, who cannot ward off the shadow of a complicated birth. And so, the blood flows, and the mothers are lost. Deceptive, these numbers, masking the work yet to be done. Meanwhile, the healers for the children, those who mend the bellies of the young, seem fewer. The records of care after birth, fragments incomplete, tell a story of neglect, of low numbers across the land.\n\nThe cut that saves, the cesarean, is rare. Four percent, it whispers. Seven in the cities, but in the countryside, it is only two. The disparity speaks of a land divided, where the roads to health lie clustered in the city’s embrace. The poor, too, find themselves at the end of a long road. Twenty-seven percent separates the rich from the poor in the quest for care, the cost paid in coins and in lives.\n\nAs the future beckons, the path is unclear. How does one mend this broken tapestry of care? Does the solution lie in the silos of programs, or in the foundation of the system itself? The allure of programs is undeniable, their targets clear, their goals attainable. Yet the danger lies in their singular focus, for where one field flourishes, another withers. Resources drawn to the bright flame of funding leave others in shadow. Programs uncoordinated, services duplicated, a tangle of forms and paper trails, all whispering of a need unmet.\n\nAnd so, the question lingers in the heavy air: Where do we go from here?",
            "In the span of a century, the realm of Popular Music has swelled, its borders stretching to encircle a multitude of genres, each a testament to the human spirit's restless quest for expression. It is a labyrinthine world, where genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—mere whispers of names upon the wind—branch into countless sub and sub-sub genres, each a tributary to the great river of sound. Amongst these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands as a colossus, unmatched in its diversity and in the depth of its expression over these past forty years. It is a music of shadows and echoes, where the spectrum of emotion is broad yet often cast in somber hues. From its inception, Heavy Metal revealed a malleability, a capacity for variation that artists seized upon to craft new sub-genres, and from these, further branches sprouted, a tree ever-growing, its roots deep in the earth of time.\n\nIn this day, we find ourselves amidst a thicket of Heavy Metal's offshoots, each a niche unto itself, blurring the lines of what Heavy Metal truly is. It has become a mosaic, drawing in themes from distant musical lands, yet all journeys have a beginning. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the world today, one must first comprehend this movement—a force that transcends mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement carved from darkness. It is a symphony of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more spectacle. It is a testament to skill, where the musicians wield their instruments with a mastery that sings through the chaos. And yet, it is a movement steeped in the haze of substance, for the psychedelic tides of the mid-seventies washed over the creators, birthing works of otherworldly madness, with the drugs a convenient muse. Metal's heart is visceral, its soul a sonnet of the dark, a revelation to a musical landscape that had seldom dared tread such shadowed paths. The echoes of the Romantic Era's brooding cadences whisper through its veins. Lyrics, like those penned by Byrne, speak to the darkness that forms the bedrock of this movement.\n\nConsider Helter Skelter, where the Beatles ventured into the abyss. It is a dance of highs and lows, a reflection of a drug-laden odyssey. Some declare it among the first Heavy Metal songs, a retort to the Rolling Stones' own descent into heaviness. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle, to show that they too could plumb the depths, and so they enshrined it within The White Album.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists began their dream-laden canvases, there stood Henri Rousseau, crafting dreams with the steady patience of a man laying bricks against the passage of time. The Dream, a painting from 1910, bore witness to his journey, a tableau of wonder and longing. There, a woman sat, eyes wide at the marvels unfolding around her in the landscape of her slumber. Yet it was not just her dream Rousseau painted; it was his own, a dream of being counted among the greats, of hearing his name spoken in reverence across the salons and galleries. In his heart, a war raged, a question hung over his art like a shadow: to echo the voices of others, to mold his brushstrokes to the forms of those deemed worthy by the critics, or to let his heart guide his hand, to paint with the rawness and truth of his own vision. The Dream stands like a stone marker at a crossroads, capturing the very essence of his battle, the choice between conformity and the wild, uncharted path of originality. \n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first pause and consider the man himself, Henri Rousseau, born in the spring of 1844 in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father was a man of modest means, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who tasted the comforts of bourgeois life. Rousseau, he did not come to art by way of academies or schools. His days were spent in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a keeper of tolls, though many would mistakenly dub him a douanier, a customs inspector. Life dealt him its blows—a wife lost, Clémence by name, and with her the lives of eight children who never saw the light of day. Only his daughter Julia remained, a living reminder of what was taken. In his sorrow, he turned to the canvas, seeking solace in the creation of something new. Unlike his contemporaries who painted tales of peasants with rose-tinted brushstrokes, Rousseau remained a folk painter at heart, his dreams and aspirations rooted in the soil of his class. \n\nIt was not surprising that Rousseau yearned for the approval of the art world. He was a man who came to painting without the pedigree of formal training, a novice who picked up his brushes later in life, surrounded by the luminaries of modern art who cast long shadows. Recognition was a slow river, and though he labored for years, it was only in the dawn of the new century that the world began to take notice, a time when Matisse was already carving out his legacy. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon wrote of them both, acknowledging a truth: while Matisse painted with the fear of falling into the mundane, Rousseau sought to paint the very picture that would unlock the gates to the Artiste Français, to be counted among their ranks.",
            "In the quiet of the world there lies a thread unbroken, a tie that binds the seen to the unseen, the truth to the beauty. Many have pondered this link that seems to defy the edges of knowing, a connection that whispers in the shadows of our existence. Keats, in his own way, has spoken of it, the urn bearing witness to a truth that is beauty and a beauty that is truth. In this world we wander, much of what we gather is through the lessons of the world and the harshness of experience. Yet there are things we seem to know without the learning, an innate understanding that speaks to us of ethics and aesthetics in ways beyond the teaching.\n\nThe essence of ethics and beauty, it seems, is not in the telling but in the showing. They are not prescriptions laid down in stone but whispers of understanding that skirt the edges of our comprehension. We do not seek to dictate what is good or fair but rather to unravel the why of it, to understand the grace of a painting or the righteousness of an act. Critics may speak of Mona Lisa’s mysteries in terms of light and shadow, of history and form, but the essence of her smile eludes them. When asked of our own heart’s favorite, we might stumble over words, saying only, “There’s something about it,” before the walls of explanation rise around us. Art and morality, both, resist the cages of description, standing as Flannery O’Connor put it, as stories that cannot be spoken in any other tongue. They whisper of a beyond, a transcendence that remains when the words have faded, a truth that stands alone.\n\nIn the quiet places of our hearts, ethics and art speak in voices not of this world. As Wittgenstein suggests, ethics cannot be caught in the trap of expression. They are the gleam off distant waters, the echo of a song we cannot quite remember. This nameless something, this je ne sais quoi, is the soul of art and morality, a power that lies in the spaces between words, in the unsaid and the unspoken.\n\nThe bond between morality and art is forged in the fires of the unseen, where the world touches the eternal. Literature, perhaps most of all, holds the weight of this truth. McKean speaks of its moral heart, of how it holds a mirror to life’s values, reflecting the principles that guide us through the darkness. In literature, as in life, we find the measure of what matters, the echo of our own souls in the written word. Here, in the pages of story, we see ourselves, and in seeing, we understand.",
            "In the expanse of shadows cast by the Alps down to the Baltic's restless edge lies a nation, stitched together from the sinews of time. Germany, a land forged in the crucible of history, where the echoes of ancient tribes still whisper in the wind that sweeps across the Rhine from Köln to the Elbe's Saxon banks in Dresden. This tapestry of culture, woven of many threads, draws from the roots of Germania, the ancestral soil.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost in the annals of time, stirs debates among the scholars who seek its origin. Tacitus, in the dim corridors of history, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe whose name was once German before they dared the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first penned \"Germanus\" in his Gallic Wars, a distinction born from the tongues of the Gauls to mark those unconquered beyond the river’s icy flow. The word's birth remains shrouded; some say it spoke of neighbors in the Gaulish tongue, others of spears glinting in battle, or the clamor and cry that marked their presence (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC; O.E.D, 2010).\n\nIn the annals of Tacitus, penned in the year of our Lord AD 98, he spoke of the Germans, untamed and pure, their blood unmixed by the tide of migration. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"for in ancient times, it was not by land but by ship that those seeking new homes arrived. Who would forsake Asia, Africa, Italy for Germania's wild lands, its sky leaden, its manner grim, unless it was his birthplace?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWho indeed would leave the marble heart of Rome for the shadowed forests of Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions, seeking the spoils of these untamed lands. Yet, like the tide, they often receded to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging like specters in the first century's twilight, lingered on Rome's periphery, trading the land's bounty and lending their strength to the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, disguise serves as a cunning tool, one that can weave an intricate tapestry of deceit. Yet, it is a double-edged sword, for in its shadow lies the peril of losing oneself eternally. To end such a masquerade is to face the abyss of alienation. A choice must be made, between the preservation of self or the fragile bonds that tether one to others. And while some may greet revelation with indifference, others will not suffer such trickery lightly, their offense a testament to the charade's folly.\n\nThe matter of deception intertwined with the reversal of gender roles becomes a tangled skein, raising questions that gnaw at the soul. Chief among these is the query: why? What compels one to abandon their true self, donning the guise of another gender? Viola's path is one of necessity, a shield against a world of potential harm: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a land foreign and unknown, Viola finds her refuge in the semblance of manhood, a cloak against the wolves that might prowl. Yet, this guise isolates her from the sisterhood she might have known, severing the ties of feminine kinship. Her mimicry is so flawless that Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, succumbs to love's blind folly. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). And still, there lies the unspoken yearning between Viola and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo the discerning eye of the modern reader, Twelfth Night reveals how deception can unearth the buried truths of the heart, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. The presence of Viola as Cesario forces these characters to confront desires long hidden in shadow. Does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from the appearance of manhood or does it betray an unspoken inclination towards women? Yet, one might argue otherwise, viewing Olivia as a satirical figure, a mirror reflecting those who judge solely by outward guise.\n\nHer swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her acceptance of Viola as kin rather than paramour—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—speaks to the caprice of her heart, shaped by the whims of sight alone.",
            "Under the indifferent sun of the colonial expanse, the German dominion was not a singular beast. It was a varied and multifaceted entity, brutal in some quarters and yet capable of nurturing, as the shifting sands of its territories attested. Like the distant echoes of a gunshot, the scars of its reign lingered most fiercely upon the Ovaherero and Nama, their fate sealed in the unforgiving deserts of German South West Africa. Yet, to paint the entire empire with the same brush is to overlook the discordant notes in its symphony of rule. \n\nIn the heart of Tanganyika, under the British eye in 1919, they unearthed a populace that spoke in the tongues of books and letters, a testament to the German hand that had once guided them. Kamerun, too, bore witness to the commendations of chroniclers who praised the educational endeavors of the Germans there. But in the barren stretches of South West Africa, the story differed. There, the mission of education for the native was a task abandoned to the missionaries, their palms open to the sky for whatever scant government blessing might fall their way. Meanwhile, the European youth basked in the structured embrace of state schools, the coffers opened wide for their enlightenment.\n\nThe legacy of this disparity rippled through time, leaving South West Africa adrift in a sea of ignorance, the people unlettered and voiceless. It was a consequence born of many threads—social, political, economic—all weaving a tapestry of neglect. This paper seeks to unravel those threads, to shine a light on the settlers and the rulers, to understand the weight of their gazes upon the native souls.\n\nIn the annals of history, penned mostly in the German tongue and inscribed during or just after the empire's fall, lies a wealth of knowledge on this colonial education. Early accounts sought merely to document, but later voices in English expanded the tale, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the intricacies of each colony's approach to learning. Among these, Cohen stands prominent, dissecting the educational pathways of South West Africa alongside its eastern counterpart. His findings trace the roots of divergence to the settler masses who called South West Africa home, their presence shaping the schools that rose from the dust.\n\nIn South West Africa, the land was kinder, its climate temperate despite the desert's reach. This drew Europeans to its bosom, nearly fifteen thousand by 1913, standing in stark contrast to the more modest gathering in East Africa. Thus, the story of education in the German colonial empire is one of contrasts, of lands and peoples, of intentions and outcomes, each chapter written in the ink of its own circumstances.",
            "In the annals of history, the United States and Mexico stood as two nations entwined in a rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the close of 1893. At the heart of this struggle was the Mexican-American War, a conflict waged between 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in an act of conquest, seized from Mexico the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, claiming them as new territories. This was but the peak of many confrontations that would echo between the two until the eve of the Great War.\n\nThis tale of rivalry is not unlike that of other nations who share their borders, for the earth is carved with lines that separate and yet bind. Nations that are neighbors often find themselves in the throes of conflict, their interests clashing like waves against the shore. As Pletcher once noted, the United States found its most enduring diplomatic trials with Mexico and Cuba, while other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations.\n\nReligion, too, played its part, as it has in the stories of many lands. It was a rift as old as the hills, borne from the suspicion between the English and the Spanish, a distrust passed down from their colonial forebears. Frahm wrote of this, likening it to the ideological struggles of later years, where the United States stood opposed to the specters of fascism and communism, yet in those earlier times, it was against Catholicism and monarchy that they railed. Thus, the seeds of discord were sown, hindering the path to peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts, those chroniclers of old, counted seventeen disputes between these nations during their half-century of rivalry, most of them over the lands they bordered. Bandits and outlaws traversed these lines, causing strife until both nations marshaled their forces to quell the unrest.\n\nBut time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt speaks of the shift in the winds, as Mexico found itself leaning upon the United States, its ambitions no longer for land but for the wealth within. Thus did the fires of rivalry cool, and a new era dawned on the horizon.",
            "Fifteen years past, an affliction unknown and unbidden laid me low, a shadow come to steal the light from my days. I had been a nurse, sworn to the call of healing, drawn to it by the deep-seated yearning for a safety and security that had eluded my childhood. The words echoing like a chant in the halls of memory—\"Work will always be there; the sick will always need tending.\" These words shaped my path, though the heart held dreams of science and the ink of journalism, a blend of the two perhaps. Yet it was nursing I chose.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, unmoored, single, pockets near empty, and the work denied me. Disabled still, these fifteen years on, living by the grace of Social Security’s mercy, with naught to claim as my own. Life’s course a constant struggle, a siege upon the bastions of security and self-worth. Certainty, that old companion, now a ghost. Yet through it all, one truth stands immutable: without the kindness of kin and the steadfastness of friends, these years would have been insurmountable, no matter the strength I fancied I possessed. For when calamity comes, it strips bare the illusion of strength.\n\nLife holds its calamities, the small and the vast. No certainties, no assurances stand unbroken, and preparation, though it girds us well, cannot alone conquer the immense. I find myself in accord with the notion that we mustn't place our trust solely in the crumbling edifice of government. Yet I hold dear the belief that we must rekindle the trust amongst ourselves, learn once more the art of giving aid and seeking it, rather than retreating to solitude, building bunkers against the world.\n\nThis talk of rugged individualism, the mythic backbone of this land, but truth lies elsewhere. It was compassion and shared burdens that sustained our forebears through the lean times, not solitary striving. The wagon trains that braved the Rockies to the far coast did not travel in isolation.\n\nSo yes, prepare as you must. I am ready. A kit of necessities, a balm against disaster. Supplies for wounds, tablets to make water pure, plastic and tape to seal against unseen threats. Flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches to light the dark. Canned goods to stave off hunger. If land is yours, and the means to farm it, to preserve its bounty, then do so. A wood stove is a wise companion, though perhaps not for those in lofty dwellings.\n\nBut remember, in your preparations, to know your neighbors.",
            "In a time long past, in the dusked corridors of history, there came into being a prince whose path would wind through the world and away from it, toward enlightenment, and in the telling he would be known as Buddha. In such manner did the teachings rise, like smoke from a distant fire, and they would bear the shape of Buddhism, rooted in the ancient earth yet reaching ever upward. Among its branches, there is one most true, called Theravada. The faith breathes the air of some twenty-five centuries, and time has carved it differently from the days when the Buddha walked beneath the sky. It manifests in places like Sri Lanka, where men of robes and men of toil partake in the waters' annual communion, though the Buddha himself spoke not of such rites. These shifts run deep, from the surface of ritual down to the marrow of salvation. And so the Theravada way, in its cloisters and in its homes, has learned to bend beneath forces, both from within and without, both harsh and indifferent.\n\nTerms must be drawn here like lines in the sand. The internal and the external, these are the first. Internal, born of those who walk the path of the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the yellow robes or not. External, the winds that blow from the lands of other faiths. Hostile forces are those that strike at the heart, wishing ill or casting shadows on the Buddhist soul. Benign forces pass like clouds, neither to aid nor to hinder, yet their shadows may cool or darken all the same. These will be our compass as we seek to understand.\n\nTo begin, one must look to the heart of the faith, the doctrines that burn like a steady flame in the night. Refuge is sought in the triple gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, bound in the Tripitaka, the baskets that hold the teachings. The Sutta Pitaka, with its words like rivers. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules that bind. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, the thoughts that roam the sky. Metaphysics speaks of Anatta, the void of self; Dukkha, the sorrow stitched into life's fabric; Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Only in seeing these can one step off the wheel, the unending turn of death and rebirth, the great Sansara. And with its end, desire and hatred and delusion shall fall away, a lightening of the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the path of conduct. Five precepts for the layman: to kill not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not, to drink not. For the monks, the rules are many and strict. At the center of all, the four noble truths stand like sentinels. Dukkha, the world’s sorrow. The chain of suffering, forged by attachment. And the promise that the chain can be broken."
